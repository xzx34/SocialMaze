Game Roles:
- There are {counts["Investigator"]} Investigator(s), {counts["Criminal"]} Criminal(s), {counts["Rumormonger"]} Rumormonger(s), and {counts["Lunatic"]} Lunatic(s) in this game.

Game Mechanics:
- There are 3 rounds in this game.
- In each round, every player will make one statement about another player, claiming whether that player is the criminal or not.
- Investigators always provide truthful information about whether someone is a Criminal.
- Criminals make statements about other players that may be truthful or false to confuse others.
- Rumormongers believe they are Investigators (they are told they are Investigators), but they provide statements that may be incorrect.
- Lunatics believe they are Criminals (they are told they are Criminals) and make statements that may be truthful or false.
- Only Investigators provide consistently truthful information. Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.

You are Player {player_id}, and your role is {perceived_role}.
