You connect this to the car's 12v adapter and it will generate 150w of power but you do have to make sure your cars battery is producing a bit more than 12v. My SUV battery produces 14v and so this power inverter works just fine.<br /><br />I have attached some Image / Video, it might not show up right away. Amazon has since change the way how they process these and when it will show up on the reviews. Please be patience. Thank You.<br /><br />I was offered this free sample item for evaluation."

I originally bought the BESTEK 300W Dual 110V AC Outlets Power Inverter  do to the reviews but I returned it because the fan runs all the time. The Silicon Devices inverter is well made with an aluminum body which helps keep it cool so the fan only comes on once in a while or not  at all if the power load is light and if the power load is heavy and the Silicon inverter heats up only then does the fan come on and rapidly cools off the inverter then shuts back off. I tested it for about 4 hours on a 100 watt load and it handled it easily and the fan only come on for a few seconds until it cooled off the inverter then the fan shut off. The Silicon 150 watt inverter plugs into the cars outlet like the 300 watt Bestek but I would not put over 150 watts through my trucks outlet, not a good idea. A 300 watt inverter should connect directly to the battery not through a lighter plug. 150 watts runs everything that I need to run and doesn't suck up unnecessary power for a fan that runs constantly.<br /><br />I bought this after looking and trying out several inverter on my own and didn't get a discount or promotion I just decided to give it a try and I am glad.<br />Please believe me that the Silicon 150 watt inverter is a perfect choice for a car plug in inverter it work perfectly."

It does exactly what it claims it does (shift color in temperature), yet the color change happens a lot faster than I expected. The color selection in great! I have been wearing my first set-- as seen in the picture -- for nearly a week, and I am in love. They are as sturdy as tips, and the polygel is on the thicker side which means a little goes a long way. I am excited to use the rest of the colors as I love how my first set turned out. The price is a great value for all the supplies/products you get. The forms are well made, and sturdy and the nail file came handy in the natural nail buffing process. I would definitely buy more polygel from Saviland in the future."

Recently my skin was out of control - terrible acne and inflammation, and I even had a prescription to control it, which wasn’t working.  I looked up this oil, immediately ordered it and use it as my nightly moisturizer.  My acne has cleared dramatically and my skin is super moisturized.

I dunno, based on the pictures and the way it was described by online influencers, I thought it was this enormous tub of latex, lol.<br /><br />I have a bottle of liquid latex from Pueen that's running low, in pink, which is why I ordered this particular color (wanted to stay consistent), and I'll pour some of this in there (once it's empty; don't wanna mix the latex types) just to make using it easier and so it doesn't dry out from opening the lid frequently."

My problem is that when I do all of those things the polish gets all over my skin making clean up take a bit longer than I like. So I needed to find something that could help with that problem. In comes this liquid latex!<br /><br />I ordered one in the hopes that it would help with keeping the skin around my nails clean while I'm doing those messy manicures. I cleaned out an empty nail polish bottle and filled it up with this liquid latex. Then I used the brush from the nail polish bottle to apply the liquid latex to the skin around my nails. I gave it a few minutes to dry then did my manicure. Once done with the manicure I used a little nail polish remover on a brush to make sure none of the latex was attached to the polish on my nail (don't want to ruin the manicure by pulling the polish on my nail off with the latex). Then, using tweezers, I pulled the latex off of each finger. For the most part it came off easily leaving clean up much easier with less to clean.<br /><br />This was a lifesaver! I am very pleased with this liquid latex. The only thing I don't like about it is the smell, it's almost a fishy smell. It is very strong at first when applying. Once dried the smell does dissipate for the most part so it doesn't bother me that much.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I am not affiliated with the seller or this product and am under no obligation to provide a positive review nor do I receive any sort of compensation one way or the other.

They can be used without magnet too but magnet gives them a very neat even more shifty effect. I do reccomend using a black or darker colored base coat for optimum effect, but you can also pull it off as is. You just need a few coats. Also, I recommend giving the bottle a little shake before opening and applying and holding the magnet over the nail for a few seconds to really get the magnetic effect. I like that it comes with 6 different colors. Some of them did look similar in the bottles but they are definitely different once you apply them. I will note that I did not have a proper magnetic wand but I used a regular round magnet I had at home and still got the magnetic effect. I would definitely reccomend these."

        "text": "What a great idea! I used suggestions from reviewer “mom of 4” with some exceptions.  I did not use any OPI branded products to prep my nails.  OPI nas 99 is just 99% isopropyl alcohol so I just used that.  MUCH cheaper!  (Buy it at the dollar store!)  I also used Gelish PH Bond Prep as that is what I had.<br /><br />I watched some You Tube vids before applying the nail guards.  I saw that most of the posters used some kind of tool to press down the nail guards and later discovered a silicone nail tool was what I saw; I almost bought one but ended up with really good results using the eraser end of a new pencil.  Now, don’t despair if you don’t apply the nail guards perfectly!  Mine were rather wrinkledy but the wrinkles were covered by the builder gel.  I also found the guards wrinkled much less when I applied them from the cuticle end and put some traction on the tip end, pulling the guard down over my fingertip gluing to my finger skin before filing the excess.  Make sure you file DOWN and not across to remove the excess nail guard.  That’s a mistake I made when I first applied these.  Don’t worry if you mess up the application of these guards.  A few times I had to remove the guard just placed as I completely trashed it on the application.  I found that instead of breaking into another card, I could just use two smaller guards to completely cover my billboard-sized nails.<br /><br />While searching nail videos, I stumbled on Liz at The Nail Hub.  If you have not seen her videos, do yourself a favor and watch some.  She showed a “pushing” technique in which the gel is laid down on the middle of the nail then pushed towards the cuticle end and sidewalls of the nail, flattening the nail brush.  I tried this and it resulted in a much thinner amount of product in those areas with a more natural looking nail at the end.<br /><br />I used In.Hype Camouflage Pink UV Builder Gel rather than the OPI branded product (it was half the cost) laying down two very thin coats and curing each coat for 90 seconds.  Then I applied two coats of my color – curing each for 60 seconds.  I’m currently in love with Allenbelle chameleon thermic color 5738, a light pink to dark pink temperature changing glitter polish.  I then used one coat of Gelish Top It Off as that is what I had, curing for 90 seconds.  My manicure lasts perfectly for two weeks which is about as long as I can stand it before the grow-out starts to bug me.  When I’m ready to redo my manicure I just pry the polish off with the paddle end of an orange stick dipped in polish remover.  The polish pops right off with absolutely NO damage to my natural nails!  The popped off polish looks like a press-on nail!<br /><br />I applied gel nail polish for years but got tired of the soaking and scraping technique to get the polish off, which also damaged my nail beds.  So I went back to regular nail polish for a few years.  This wasn’t really a fix, as a regular polish manicure lasts less than a week for me before the polish chips or I just peel it off.  Now I can have a long-lasting mani that doesn’t ruin my natural nails!  YAY for nail guards!"

They don't seem to be getting worse. I've only been on it for 5 weeks, so I can't vouch for Restoration. But yes, it does something good.<br /><br />UPDATE ON 2nd ORDER: Yes, these have kept pain at bay while I've been getting extensive dental work done. But this last order I placed on 5/11/21 says a week later they haven't even shipped yet and they were supposed to arrive a day from now! BUT ALL OF A SUDDEN I'M GETTING NOTIFIED THEY WON'T ARRIVE TILL 5/26/21?!? WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON? IT SAYS THEY'RE IN STOCK.

I won't name it as I want no part of this scam.<br /><br />This is not what I ordered (ingredients were not listed I have a screenshot at the time).<br /><br />I know the Steel Bite Pro distributed by Steel Bite Pro that contains BEET ROOT and does NOT contain LICORICE ROOT which has potentially life-threatening side effects for certain demographics and isn't meant for longterm use. The ingredients are vastly different.<br /><br />I don't know which company came out with a product first.<br /><br />I am furious that this has happened and will demand my money back and probably contact the FDA. The product I had used (from SBP Utah)  helped my colon immensely -- this after a 10-year search. The original product talks about gut health and relation to teeth. This is junk per the label."

It's hard to tell, but I seem to be experiencing less inflammation and discomfort in my gums and yes, my teeth do feel \"tighter.\" I've been concerned because at 65, my bite seems to be changing (growing long in the tooth?),  my gums receding (they have been for years), and my teeth felt like they had an unusual amount of \"float.\" Too early to give it an enthusiastic 5-star, but I'm optimistic. I plan to purchase another 5 bottles and see if my gums seem to grow healthier and stronger over the next several months. If they do, I'll be back to upgrade my review. BONUS: SBP contains almost 3x the recommended daily threshold of Zinc, a known reduce susceptibility to COVID19 when combined with vitamin D3 and other antioxidants."

I've tried so many different items for putting my hair up quickly and easily, and these BY FAR blow away all the competition!

The black coating does chip off a bit, but it's not even really noticeable, since the majority of the prong is covered by your hair. They will bend a little (from side-to-side and not in a scrunchy fashion) if you're really trying to cram them in, but they go right back in place. I have bent mine so many times, and they've not broken yet. :) Anyway, love 'em, wish more people loved 'em, because I have no clue what I'll use if mine ever do break.

I needed an alternative to the typical elastic hair tie to throw my hair up. I'm afraid I wear my hair up so often that I probably have a big line of breakage across my hair from where the hair tie goes. This is that perfect item I was looking for. It's easy and I get multiple looks out of it. It's even fancier than just popping my hair up in a pony tail, so I don't feel obligated to fix my hair before I go out if I've had it up with this device. Sometimes some of my shorter strands do fall out of this, but that is because those strands are barely long enough for an elastic- not this products fault!

I haven't tried all the styles pictured but I often wear a low &#34;knot&#34; style bun, and this thing keeps it in place as well or better than other methods I've tried (including using a a gazillion bobby pins, or a couple of  those &#34;corkscrew&#34; pins) and in less time. It takes a bit of judgement to wedge it in comfortably without the prongs pushing against your scalp. One star off because it's pretty large (the ends will show unless you have a LOT of hair) and because I've noticed the two central prongs do deform a bit with use. You can easily bend them back so that all 4 prongs are parallel again - but I suspect over time the metal will fatigue. But with two units in the pack, you have a backup if one breaks."

It's basically a gigantic bobby pin on steroids, 4 thick metal prongs that are curved to follow the shape of your head.  I found the written instructions confusing but searched on YouTube and found some videos that explain it well.  Once I got the hang of it I was able to do the messy bun style in about a minute.<br /><br />My hair is fine and slippery, and I have a lot of layers, so there is some hair poking out when I do it, but it's much better than what I would be able to achieve with bobby pins.  I expect it will work better once my hair grows out a bit.  You can make these hairstyles as tight or as loose as you want depending on how much hair you gather in the pin as you flip it, so it's good for those that have a lot of hair to wrangle as well as those who get headaches if their hair is pulled back tightly.  If you have past your shoulders that is wavy or curly (like the model in the diagrams) I think that is ideal, but I think you can make it work with most hair types.<br /><br />For less than $5 for a 2-pack it's worth a try, and if it doesn't work for you, pass it on to a friend with a different hair length/texture."

I hated to take a star away but if half my product it’s going to leak out what good is it then."

Well, I can say that I received the product as indicated, on time. The packaging was perfect; no rips, tears, gouging, etc. There was appropriate use of &#34;bubble&#34; wrap in the box, and the product itself was unharmed during the shipping process.<br /><br />When I opened the box and saw the clips I realized they were just what I needed. My car has lost a couple of them during the getting in and getting out process. They fit perfectly and appear to be quite sturdy, and they were easy to install. I don't claim to be an expert on cars, or know anyone that is, but I do know quality product when I see it, and this is definitely quality.<br /><br />As for communication with the company; it was superb. I initially had difficulty getting to the discount code and registering for the product. The owner was right on it and stayed connected with me until it was resolved; which didn't take long at all.<br /><br />In closing, I recommend this product, and will be looking for other products to try out conceptualized/manufactured by this company."

They quickly apologized about the problem and handled it wonderfully.  I would buy from this company just based on this experience.<br />I really like this eye cream, I press a small amount into the palm of my hand.  There is no scent, and it is a light cream color that I apply around and under my eyes in a Tapping Motion.  Have only been using a short time but I think that it is getting rid of some of my puffy black circles.<br /><br />This is a rich cream that goes on easy and quickly absorb, and I like it very much"

I’ve noticed an improvement in the area. The moisture benefit alone has helped minimize the appearance of wrinkles. I’ve also noticed that the skin looks brighter and healthier, like it has more elasticity. This moisturizer really penetrates deep into the skin cells rather than sitting on top of the skin. I can tell that my skin absorbs the moisturizer because it doesn’t leave an oily feeling and the skin feels a lot better.<br /><br />BENEFITS: This has retinol, which is one of the few active ingredients for treating wrinkles. I’ve reacted badly to some retinol treatments in the past, but this one has worked well. The ceramide helps to retain a moisture barrier on the skin to prevent it from drying out. Collagen is what gives us that youthful appearance, so I always look for it in my moisturizers.<br />I am really happy with this moisturizer!"

The striped ones are a silkier fabric while the floral printed ones are a more textured fabric. These don't stretch all the way around your head like many headbands do, you have to stretch it over your head around where you want it to be and then style your hair from there. Not the best pick for a quick hair fix, perhaps a standard elastic headband would be best for that! They seem to be pretty sturdy on the head; a lot of headbands can tend to slip around or even fall off. I didn't wear these for a long time, but I tested their strength by moving my head around and they stayed pretty much in place. They are a tad bit more narrow than I had anticipated, but you can sort of splat out the fabric if you like a wider headband like me. I attached a few of the pictures I took while trying them out. I love how they look with my hair both up and down! It adds a touch of flair and class to even a simple bun. Overall I really like these. They fit the style I was looking for with a great price.

But for $16 you get 12 of these guys so you gotta lower your expectations.  1 makes the water black but very translucent with no stains.  2 makes the water much blacker and less translucent but still a little see through and starts to leave black marks inside the tub.  3 is nearly opaque and really leaves a lot of black marks behind.  Keep in mind it’s not staining your tub at all!! It’s staining the soap scum so all you need to do is clean your tub.  If you notice you get black marks on your tub with even 1 bomb you either have a very old tub or have not cleaned it in awhile.  Any marks that may occur on skin easily scrub off.  Finally these don’t really fizz much so you have to physically slosh the water around to make the black even.  Hope this helps someone.  Enjoy your bath :)"

But this product is a whole different beast when it comes to eye cleaning and lubrication. I have chronic dry eye that bothers me often enough where I always have eye drops on hand. I also wear makeup enough where some of the grossness will get into my eye and stay there. So needless to say there is a good amount of buildup inside my eyes I don’t see. I started using this product once a week and it makes your eyes feel clean (which sounds weird but if you experience it you will understand). There is no stinging sensation and all you have to do is open your eye in the solution and look around for like 30 seconds. It feels weird but also good at the same time. Will definitely buy again after I finish this bottle lol."

This eye wash completely removes all the nasty buildup of oil and leftover makeup - I no longer have to walk around with a film over my eyeballs after taking off my makeup!! Great if you wear contacts too and your eyes get irritated/dry during the day. The only word of warning I’ll say is that it does sting a little bit while you’re rinsing your eyes, but that completely goes away once you pat dry! Also, this bottle is HUGE. Probably twice the size of your average contact solution - so its gonna last you a while."

Hyaluronic acid helps plump my skin and I think it is also a great base for the rest of my skin care.  I don't feel this product causes tackiness, but I do feel like my skin drinks it in when I gently press my hands to my face when I apply.  I am giving 5 stars though because in the past this product has been wonderful and I am hoping the packaging didn't change it.  So far so good.

This is the portion to be glued on - if these lashes were wrapped around the wire at the apex to create the band, they would be much more comfortable and would be easier to affix.

These are made of bambo and tolerate that wet home very nicely. They have a c lassy sort of look. The head is removable so that you can use it as a body scrubber and then plug in the handle far reaching those tough to reach areas on your back. The body scrubber has an elasticated handle strap to help you from dropping it once lathered up with slippery soap.<br /><br />It comes with two of each so one went to an elderly member of the family that has trouble reaching areas that a younger person can easily reach. That gives him more freedom while showering. The brush brissles are a natural material and have just the right amount of stiffnes and softness to feel good but do the job at hand.

I have thick, heavy hair that has been really long for more than 40 years and no combs were ever able to hold its weight.  A few years ago I cut my hair shorter.  Right now it's shoulder length; not quite long enough to put in a pony tail but too long to keep it easily out of my face.  I hoped these combs would be a good interim solution and I absolutely loved the color and flash of the rhinestones.<br /><br />With care, and holding onto the bottom part of my hair tightly while we place the combs, we can get them to hold my hair for a few hours (see photo) but then it starts to fall out unless we put the comb toward the top of my head.  Then they stay in for twice as long.  Still, I never make it through a full day with them, but while they last they look really pretty!"

        "text": "Where to start with this thing...?<br /><br />Pro's first I guess:<br />- Sturdy and well made. It was relatively easy to put together once it arrived, but somewhat cumbersome trying to do so alone. Assembly involves raising up the back seat from the bottom portion (Akin to folding up the back seat of a car) and sliding on the arm bolts into a groove, attaching the hoses, rotating it onto a metal beam, and screwing in a screw into the wooden beams of the arm through a hole in the seat.<br />- The S-Beam thing was pretty powerful, so it is definitely capable of doing that \"deep tissue\" massage on your back but is more of a Con in this case (Will describe later)<br />- Leg supports were \"extendable\" (according to the exact words of the images on the product) in that if you pushed hard enough, the spring loaded support would give out a bit and allow the leg segment to go out a bit. If you didn't apply constant pressure, it would spring back into place (somewhat of a con / misleading feature advertisement)<br /><br />Now for the Cons:<br />- The biggest and most glaring issue is that this thing *caused* more pain than helped it. The S-Track system they have in place is falsely advertised in their product video and images showing the track going all the way down to the hips / buttocks. This is not even remotely the case. It stops right at the lower back. I have attached a screenshot of their product demonstration video and a red line indicating exactly where the S-Track system *actually* goes down to. In addition to the fact that the massage is not complete, this is compounded by the fact that the product description lists the width of the rollers as \"adjustable\" This is also *not* the case as there is no method to do so from the user's controller. The rollers DO adjust outwards and inwards, but this is a feature of the massage, not something that the user can control to suit their needs. A bit of deliberate misleading on their part, if you ask me.<br />- As stated before, the S-Track system isn't at all what it advertised as. We also had no indication of this \"Body Scan\" feature working as intended. The instructions state that when you turn on the unit, it scans your body. There is no LED / Indicator / noise / alert / etc. indicating that this is taking place. When we turned on the unit it just immediately going into a default massage mode. There were no buttons to invoke this feature manually, nor any way to adjust the body settings. You get a rudimentary \"Massage Type\", \"Intensity Setting\" and a \"manual mode\" where you can direct the S-Track to a specific spot up or down the track. Thats all.<br />- The Air pouches that are used are WAY too strong. I had this thing turned all they way down on the \"Intensity\" setting and the air pouches were still cutting off circulation of our wrists on both myself and my fiance who used it. The feeling is akin to placing your entire arm in one of those blood pressure arm cuffs filled to the maximum - It is not enjoyable and it does not feel relaxing, it just borderline  hurts and feels like someone is squeezing your arm. There is a video review by TJ that said the same thing, so it certainly isn't just our unit.<br />- There is another set of air bags that attempt to press on your shoulders, which actually did feel nice, but the sheer force on the bags hold you in place unless you make a concentrated effort to get out - this wound up causing problems later on when the S-Track got to the upper back / neck area as the rollers were so far forward for the massage it was genuinely stabbing us in the back with the air bags keeping us held in place unable to relieve the pressure of the rollers digging into our spine. The situation is hard to describe in words sadly, but effectively think it of as someone digging their elbows into your back as hard as they can with another person holding you in place unable to move - in most situations on massage chairs you can just arch your back a bit to get off the rollers until its in a more comfortable spot... You cannot do that while the shoulder bags are inflated as they hold you down pretty well. A relatively fit person like myself can get out of it easily, but this might not be the case for people purchasing this unit for medical reasons / disabilities, or for the elderly = Just something to keep in mind.<br />- There were no pre-drilled holes in the chair where you were required to put the screws. I triple checked the instructions to ensure what I was about to do was correct.... You must force the provided screws through the leather lining and into the wood beams inside the arm segments manually. I was not happy that I would be potentially tearing / ruining the leather to follow their instructions. If I need a screw there, pre-drill it during manufacturing.<br />- Chair has built  in speakers on the arm units, but I have no knowledge on how to use them, nor were they listed in the instructions. There was no instructions to download any apps for the unit, nor did I see any bluetooth devices on my phone pop up while in discovery mode, so they seem to be for the chair itself, but we never heard anything aside from some female voice in what I assume to be French when we plugged the thing in the wall. There were no 3 millimeter jacks or any other type of audio jack on the chair itself.<br /><br />Problems specifically related to the *SELLER* and not the chair:<br />There were numerous shipping issues we encountered with the third party seller here. Not only did we receive our chair, but we received half of another customer who also bought this chair in my area. We contacted the company that delivered it and we made them aware of the mistake but they had told us the earliest they can come back would be in another 2 weeks and we would have to hold on to it until then - despite that they had just been to my residence 3 hours ago. So essentially I was stuck with a 120 pound box that was about 6 feet in length in the middle of my living room. Luckily I found the intended recipients Name, Address, and Phone number and gave him a call. He was happy to come pick it up from my residence. I didn't have to wait 2 weeks to get it out of  my house, and he didn't have to wait 2 weeks to get something he had paid for. The fact that the recipient had to pick up his own delivery from me because the company would not fix it in a timely manner was unacceptable. During the return process for this, I ended up having to call Amazon support today because they had come to pick it up July 9th (July 25 at time of writing) and I had not been refunded my payment even though the product was picked up from my residence more than 2 weeks ago. The support agent called them and confirmed that they had the product, but it has been sitting in the warehouse for a week and was scheduled to be sent back to the retailer sometime soon - effectively artificially delaying my refund until after the due date of my first payment on this. Props to Amazon though as the agent processed the refund for me anyway, as she confirmed they had gotten the product back from me and the third party company were just being slow. Otherwise I would be missing a credit card payment on my Amazon card for a product I technically didn't owe money for anymore.<br /><br />Overall, we were not happy with this unit at all as we were suffering more pain simply using it than dealing with our existing pain so we returned it.  The headache alone from the delivery company responsible for this seller is more than enough for us to void any future consideration of these products."

But so far, I am liking this! No reactions at all, from a person with sensitive skin."

Living in the desert where temps can be 110 with no humidity most of the summer, that can happen easily. My skin isn't difficult to moisturize anymore and most lotions will do the trick now. So that's why I feel like this product isn't useful. It does nothing for skin at all. My skin doesn't feel moisturized or soft when I use it. I really like the toner from this brand, but I don't find anything happens to or for my skin from this moisturizer. My skin will feel exactly as it did before. Even grocery store moisturizer works better than this. At least it doesn't leave my skin greasy or have a strong smell."

It has no scent and doesn't dry out my skin. I use several pumps and tap it on a newly cleansed face.  It hydrates without causing any redness, irritation or sensitivity.<br /><br />After the essence, I use the Itfer Emulsion.  The Emulsion has a light citrus scent and shares the light gel texture. The Emulsion is easily absorbed into the skin without a sticky or oily feel.  It leaves the skin feeling hydrated."

My hair is conditioned but light, not weighed down. My hair grows steadily, stays healthy.  Make sure you use as the directions suggest. I didn't at first and I wasn't happy with my results until I followed the directions. So, just be aware. Use as directed to be sure you get the most accurate and best results."

Granted I do live in Las Vegas, but regardless if I take these pouches with me in my purse or I leave one by our couch, the top lid gradually falls off the glue. I thot maybe I could just hot glue them but then noticed it tears along the seam where the pouch “zips” up. It’s too bad because it’s such a genius idea just need to make the product more durable somehow. Def not worth the $$ because they’re useless after a few uses.

To be sure it was not just my imagination in unfairly comparing a &quot;new&quot; product to a &quot;used&quot; product, I asked my daughter (who felt the first pack when it arrived) to feel them, too.

Additionally I couldn't find any previous product reviews which didn't settle my uneasiness either. However, after about 30 minutes of playing with the heat settings, I'm happy to say I was able to do my own fusion extensions without an issue! I'm thrilled with my purchase, and this beauty heats up quickly and consistently, as well as being easy to clean excess glue once it cools off. I'm VERY happy with this product and highly recommend it for keratin bonding and fusion extensions. It's great for anyone with little experience (I've never done my own extensions before today and only had them done twice - once with an ultrasonic tool and once using an old flat iron for heat) and even pretty easy to do areas you can't see like the back of your head. Didn't burn myself once, which is downright impressive. I would totally recommend it if you're on the fence, there are youtube tutorials showing exactly how it's done."

You get what you pay for but I only used this hair for the back of my head! Do not try to get no diva ass hair due. Hair good for half up half down  hair styles only frrl.

My boyfriend doesn't like it & says it smells &#34;old&#34; but I think it is because its such a pure floral. If you happen to like pure florals this is awesome.

Hold this contraption on your eyelashes for 10-15 seconds, and like a little eyelash curling iron it will curl them. As other reviewers have said, make sure you apply mascara first, it acts as a glue and makes the thing work. Once, I forgot to turn the eyelash curler off when I went to work and it did not burn the house down - it powered down by itself. If you are not an idiot like myself, you can put the cap back on and the physical design of the cap will push the power button to off position on the curler and you will not have to worry about burning the house down.BUY THIS.

This product remains a gel on the skin and provides a film of lubrication for the razor to glide on while shaving.  At one time it was available in retail outlets like Winn Dixie, Target, etc.  For some reason the only source is the internet.  It is an English product.

It has more of a &#34;croap&#34; type of texture, and very easily picks up on my badger brush, forming a dense, slick lather.  I don't normally do as well on the first go, as every soap/cream has its quirks -- but this one performed brilliantly on my first try.  Not only that, but I also decided to use this in combo with a brand new razor (an EJ) and a new blade (which can sometimes a bit rough on first use), both bad ideas when you're trying a new cream/soap for the first time.  Too many adjustments.  All those risks aside, the shave went PERFECTLY.  Not a nick, weep or burn.  Just a nice, clean shave and a fine smelling mug to show for it!<br /><br />Be aware that the scent can seem a bit strong while in use, but it tones down very nicely after shaving -- which makes me really appreciate the care with which the manufacturer scents their products.  As for the scent itself -- I took a while to really take to it, as again, it comes across a bit overpowering at first -- but it mellows into something unique -- all at once sweet, woodsy and spicy, but decidedly masculine -- if that makes any sense.  I highly recommend this product."

        "text": "I was really excited about getting this hair dye and using it but sadly it was a GIGANTIC disappointment 😭<br /><br />1.) On the bottle, in the item description, etc it says that the color lasts for 45 washes but I can promise you that it does NOT last that long heck it barely even lasted 10% as long as it claims to (and yes that's even with me only washing my hair in cold water, only washing my hair once a week, using color protecting products, etc). Within only 4 washes the color has drastically faded and there's even some spots where the color has completely washed out already leaving bleach blonde patches. There's a few semi/demi hair dyes i've used that will still stay pretty even when fading but unfortunately this isn't one of them- it's not ugly per say but it's really bland, lifeless and has me wanting to rush to the store to buy some more hair dye so I can fix it ASAP. I never thought in a million years i'd ever find a semi/demi hair dye that was worse then Splat when it came to fading but man this dye takes the cake- with me taking care of my colored hair properly Splat will last me 10 washes before it gets to the \"ew ugly it faded I need to do a touch up\" stage whereas once again this only lasted 4 washes.<br /><br />2.) This color isn't teal in fact it's more of a dark blue with teal highlights/shine that you can only see if you're outside or standing directly under a light inside. I bleached my hair beforehand getting it 100% bleach blonde because I wanted it to be as bright as possible and even with that it still came out dark (and even while fading it looks blue have yet to see any green). I can't speak for anyone else but a genuine teal color is the unicorn of hair dye in my world- i've been dying and cutting my own hair pretty much only using semi/demi hair dye for over 10 years now and in all that time I have yet to find a genuine teal color. I've pretty much tried every brand I could get my hands on with zero luck- it's either dark blue with teal highlights/shine like this one, 98% green with 2% blue, green, dark green, blue, etc. I know going to a salon is an option and is probably my best bet to get genuine teal but because of my failings for the last decade i'm terrified of spending a couple hundred dollars just to end up with a non teal color again 😣. What in the world is going on? 🤣 It's not the olden days where getting colors is impossible and we had to make our own colors using rare to find items it's 2022 so surely there's a way to get a GENUINE TEAL hair dye!<br /><br />3.) I can't speak for anyone else but in my experience this is hands down the thickest hair dye i've ever come across. This wouldn't of been an issue for me had the bottle design been the same as a lot of other semi/demi hair dyes are (a short easily accessible resealable cylinder) but since it wasn't and instead was put into a thick, dark and non flexible bottle it was next to impossible to get all the dye out or even see how much was in there. To get it out you either have to mix in some really watery hair conditioner or cut the bottle open and hope you don't hurt yourself or get dye all over the place in the process. While the design is visually really cute it's not practical- you end up wasting a lot of dye because you can't get it all out, in an attempt to get the remaining dye out you have to risk injuring yourself or getting dye all over the place or diluting it, since the bottle is black you have no idea how much dye is in there when you first get it so you won't know if you've been ripped off or not after getting a lot out you'll have no idea how much is still in there, because the dye is so thick and it's badly designed you end up having to constantly hit the bottom of the bottle/squeeze on it really hard/shake it hard etc just to get it out which after 20+ minutes really hurt my hands, you can't use the dye right out of the container like you can with the other cylinder hair dye containers and finally because you can't store any left over dye- the opening is so darn tiny there's no way you'll be able to get this thick dye back inside to use later on.<br /><br />4.) This cost me $12.99 plus tax per bottle (it took 4 bottles to do my hair because I have really long thick hair) and when I bought it the price didn't bother me in fact it's pretty much average as far as semi/demi hair dye goes (the cheapest hair dye I use costs $10 a piece and the most expensive I use is $15 a piece so this is right in the middle) but after taking into account that it's not a genuine teal color, how insanely quickly it fades, how unpractical the design is, that I can't store unused dye, how much ends up going to waste and all the other negatives the price is definitely not worth it to me.<br /><br />5.) If you've used semi/demi hair dye as much as I have then you already know about the notorious staining and bleeding that comes with these types of hair dyes haha but FYI this one is worse then what you're used to. With every other semi/demi hair dye i've used by the second wash the bleeding stops, the staining on my skin and ears has gone away, it doesn't stain my skin and ears while wet, scratching my scalp doesn't result in stained fingers and dye under my nails and my fingers won't get stained while I wash my hair but with this dye all those negatives have continued all the way past the 4th wash. Basically this dye has all the negatives of semi/demi hair dye but NONE of the positives 🤷🏻‍♀️<br /><br />So all in all I really don't like this hair dye and wouldn't recommend it. Tbh the only thing it has going for it is that it does make my hair feel really soft and doesn't leave a weird coating on my hair like some other semi/demi hair dyes do but that doesn't mean much when everything else was a fail. Now that I think about it though I think this dye would be perfect for people who either only want crazy colored hair for a short period of time (like for a halloween costume, cosplay, an event, etc) or for parents whose kid's want to dye their hair a crazy color because it fades really quickly and isn't bright at all and is pretty mellow for semi/demi dye, as for vets like me who actually want long lasting bright color STAY AWAY 🙏🏼😂"

I have used product like this in the past that come in spray bottles or pump bottles and that made it easier to get just what I needed. This bottle has an eye dropper type applicator. I am not a fan of this. I use it to drop some into the palm of my hand and then rub it between my hands and carefully apply it to my hair starting in the back on the most underneath layer that way the front and the top layer do not get too oily.

This gives me exactly the conditioned feeling I was looking for.

These fit snugly and the arch supports themselves are broad; they actually have a large coverage area. I have a very high arch and most arch supports barely have any affect. By themselves (walking around with only these on), I can barely feel the actual arch support itself. However, the silicone gel band gives a good snug support without being uncomfortable. They are easily stretched before putting them on and then they slowly begin to tighten to a good snug fit. You do have to be careful putting on socks over these as they have a tendency to roll up as you pull your socks on. Once you put on your shoes, the actual arch support comes into play. Because it covers a large area of your arch, they do not get tiring like some of the small area gel inserts that are not much bigger than a half dollar.  I recently developed PF in my left foot and needed some new shoes. Even with shoes that claimed they were for high arches, I still need more support and these fit the bill. I just got these today, and I am already feeling a difference in both of my feet. They are soft but very supportive. I am very glad I bought these."

After recovering and spending many months training, this foot pain re-cropped up. My PT gave me exercises but I was seriously concerned about having pain on the course and not being able to finish. I bought this and 3 other things. I tried them out literally the week of the race and figured I could just throw it away on the course if it didn't help or harmed me in some way. IT WAS AMAZING. I had no pain, it didn't rub, and bothered me in no way for the entire 26.2 miles, even though I broke the cardinal rule and \"tried something different\" right before the race. I ended up using them again on a backpacking trip through europe in some boots that didn't have much support and again, they were great. I have high arches that collapse when I bare weight, and it works for me too, it's not just for flat feet or plantar. Super happy!"

I do not alter the shape of my eyebrows so this works well for me but could be a deal breaker for you. If not, or you are quite skilled, read on.<br /><br />At first I thought I made a mistake buying this. There was a learning curve, for me, and this is how I made it work:<br /><br />1. I suggest using a candle, I use a votive. This gives me full control of the melt so I can focus on the stick and application. I could not manage to do this with a lighter. BE CAREFUL until you learn what the wax looks like at a safe temperature. Blowing on the wax fixes an overheat easily.<br /><br />2. This was my first time using a wax of this nature, so I came to find I needed a much thicker layer to ensure full removal the first go. I have thick dark hair so you may get away with less, play around with it. My application looks like a multicolored, gloppy mess when it is ready to remove because I need time to build and spread it properly.<br /><br />3. I use the stick for removal. I pull my skin taught, touch the tip of the wax stick to the edge of my application and pull. You can feel when it grips. I do not lift the stick up away from my skin at all. I keep it close and pull against the hair growth. This ensures I won't have to go over the same spot again.<br /><br />I have sensitive skin and this is the first wax where the redness leaves my face. Before I would have to make sure to wax in the evening, apply something like Neosporin, and hope the redness was gone by the morning. It would always linger somewhere so I used my concealer on already irritated inflamed skin. Ouch! Tweezing and epilating would break me out around my lip area, removal creams had the same effect as waxing but I had to use it more often, and I couldn't use the buff paper because, again, sensitive skin. Would I appreciate if this was a little more forgiving on technique, yes! I am not the most patient or skilled person. Avoiding the aftermath, however, makes it worth it for me."

Second, unlike some other bamboo brushes we've tried (PUBLIC GOODS, I'm looking at you), the handles and head are gently curved so you don't end up bumping your gums and lips against squared/sharp edges. Third, we just cut off the bristles/head and throw the rest in the compost bin when we're done. Easy and much better for the environment!"

The bottom is also divided by larger moveable pieces so you can fit larger/smaller items as you need.

If you've used natural deodorants before, you know that with most others you have to reapply or wash and reapply to stay BO-less all day.<br /><br />The only con to this product it that it is relatively hard to apply.  It's not a smooth gel or cream, but rather a hard-ish bar that you apply slowly so your body heat warms the product to spread on.  There's also a bit of technique that I've found to work best to eliminate clumping - if you swipe slowly downwards first (top to bottom) then back up, you can pick up most of the clumps that happened with your first swipe.<br /><br />The scent is fantastic with this product as well - it's light and fresh smelling.

        "text": "This deodorant is awesome! I've used so many different deodorants/anti perspirants throughout my life (Ban, Dove, Secret... clinical strength, you name it) and they work at first, but after a while (not even a full stick) I find myself sweating tons and smelling bad. I thought there was something wrong with me! My mom and sister have switched to natural deodorants, and I kept telling them there was no way some eco-friendly deodorant would work if the highest level of chemical-bomb anti perspirant didn't work for me. Anyway, after nothing working and my mom and sister telling me how much I was poisoning my pits, I decided to try going natural. So glad I did! It was a bit weird getting used to the thickness, but if you apply slowly as directed, it melts on your body. The lavender mint smell is light and refreshing, even for someone who doesn't really like lavender or mint smells by themselves. I've gone through a few sticks of this (my one complaint is that the size is so small, I'm ordering a new one every few weeks) and it still works great! Another added perk is after a few weeks the unsightly razor bumps and ingrown hairs I've been living with for years on my armpits are completely gone!  After a few weeks of using this, I noticed my pits were slightly darker and a little crusty, so I exfoliated (probably a bit too roughly) and the skin under was raw and sensitive. I thought I was having a bad reaction, but a few days later I noticed my armpits were completely smooth and my normal skin color. My pits must have had years and years of built up skin and scarring for shaving that this deodorant was somehow able to get rid of! I haven't had that weird darkness or crustiness since (I would recommend exfoliating every week or so, though).<br /><br />Bottom line, if you want to try natural deodorants but sweat and smell a lot, this should work great. Also if you struggle with redness and bumps from shaving, this can help with that too! Just be aware that you will most likely go through this faster than regular deodorant, so it's a bit of an investment. Totally worth it for me though! Never switching back to the main commercial brands!"

I initially tried Dale Aubrey product and liked it also,  compared to Dale Aubrey, this oral swish is very light and does not have that oily feel, I am able to swish for as long as I feel like, ten, fifteen minutes or longer without the burning that some talked about.  You teeth feels so clean and mouth feels so fresh, that I usually don't want to eat anything after that.  I was having problems with a dental implant where the gum was always irritated, that is no longer an issue,<br />teeth are sparkling as when you leave the dentist office.  I wanted a product that contained Myrrh and that is one of the ingredient, the products are working for me so I will continue to use them.  I have gotten rid of the other tooth pastes and mouth wash that I had used for years along with Himalayan salt,  for they were useless.  I will continue the use of Himalayan salt, one of the products did mention the pink salt.  I no longer have to favor one side of my mouth.  This natural remedy worked for me.  I received no incentive from this company, this is my honest review."

The blade edge seems too even with the comb so that when you adjust the razor you just get a wider gap that lets skin in but not more edge reveal.

If you try rolling it downwards, it won't catch the whole length of your hair and will roll out. It also helps to leave a tail and tuck it up under the bun maker after you've got it in.<br />With that said though, the slap bracelet-like bun makers come wrapped in pretty realistic looking fake hair in a good array of natural hair colors. They do stay in all day once you get the hang of it, though I still put an extra hair tie around it for piece of mind and to hold down any loose strands.

I’m still learning how to style them, etc.<br /><br />That said, of the three, this is my second favorite.  It is a lot of hair.  As someone with thin, fine hair that has been kept short for years, I think it may be almost too much hair for me.  I may have to trim it some so that it won’t feel so overpowering.  The hair itself looks decent enough that it could probably be  a daily wig for most."

To charge the device you stand it so that two contacts on the underside of the base make contact with two on the base. It's pretty basic and falls over quite easily.<br /><br />Once charging is started a pretty (pointless) blue and white light pulses gently for several hours.<br />After charging is complete you can use this to clean your teeth, by putting the \"brush\" in your mouth and turning it on. The only problem is that it doesn't do a good job. Various presses of the one button make a blue light come on and the whole device vibrate gently. This is totally insufficient to clean your teeth.<br /><br />I persevered with this for several days and my teeth felt horrible, like I hadn't brushed then at all.<br /><br />In summary - worthless."

At first I admittedly poked myself in the eye a few times, but after I got used to it, it DID work but it wasn't the easiest to use, It didn't get all over my face like some review suggest, as that's more of a manner of learning how to USE cake eyeliner, if you haven't used it before I would suggest look up some information on it.<br /><br />No, it isn't waterproof as you have to mix it with water in order to put it on, so be careful if you get it in your eyes and your eyes water a lot THEN you might get it on your face, but a simple fix to that is using a cue tip. All and all it can be an awesome addition to your make up kit, but I would suggest purchasing a small brush to put it on."

        "text": "First, I want to say that I am not a professional nail tech. I bought this because I am trying to manage my own nails during this pandemic. I started with another battery operated drill set but I felt it didn't meet my needs because there was no emery board drill bit and I couldn't adjust the speed. This set has everything you see in a professional nail salon. You get the full spectrum of drills, with emery board bits. There is a quick start guide that tells you what each drill bit is used for (although it doesn't explain what the white drill bit is for and I still haven't figured it out). The cord is just long enough for my needs but it would be better if it were six inches to a foot longer. It has adjustable speed settings.<br /><br /> My only complaint is that if you are using this for your own nails, the on/off switch and the speed wheel is further down on the cord instead of being on the drill itself. I found myself fumbling at times turn it off while half of my fingers are wrapped in cotton balls to soak off nail dip. This wouldn't be an issue for anyone using the tool to do nails on other people. It is just a minor but annoying drawback for those of us who are using the tool to do our own nails. All in all this is a really great product that has stood up to me dropping it several times and it is priced similar to much less sturdy drill sets and drill sets with fewer features. I would definitely recommend this to others."

No matter how high the temperature (even 90+ days) there is an immediate cooling sensation that is nothing short of pure delight.<br /><br />One other concern I had was that this product might result in dry skin.  Again, I was pleasantly surprised.  My skin feels soft, supple and hydrated.  In hot weather, it beats out regular lotions hands down.  I sincerely recommend this to any woman who not only wants to produce a cooling sensation on her body as the temperatures soar but also experience a gel that moisturizes without the greasiness of some lotions or the drying effects of alcohol based skin products.

Not a major concern because it will scratch over time anyway.<br /> Both were dusty and looked like they had mudd or rust all over them.  I tried to wipe the fine particles off as gently as I could to not scratch up the finish but that was impossible<br /><br />It was easy to assemble the base and legs are decent seems to be ok quality<br /><br />The reason for 3 stars is these stainless steel trays are very flimsy for the size I expected it to be slightly thicker material. They have a flex to them and already arrived warped and you can see a slight impression in the material.<br /><br /> I'm hoping with time it may settle but if it gets worse I will have to find a stronger tray to replace it with."

        "text": "I’ve tried several different Karuna masks...they’re all good, but some are better than others.  This particular set is a great mix of masks designed to help with different needs, including hydrating, soothing and brightening.  The masks are individually wrapped and presented in a box that opens like a book, with suggestions for which masks to use on which days.  The packaging is nice and these would make a great gift.  The masks are very saturated (overly saturated, IMO) with serum, with plenty left over to use on my neck.  They’re large enough to easily cover my entire face, and come with a paper backing that makes them easy to to unfold.  Because they’re so saturated they easily slip while on my face, which makes it impossible to do anything other than sit still for the 20-30 minutes I wear them.  Also, there’s so much serum left on my face after I remove the masks, it’s impossible for my skin to absorb it all.  I’ve discovered that lightly splashing my face with cold water helps remove the excess serum and my skin fully dries more quickly.  Ultimately, all of the face masks left my skin very soft and hydrated, and a few of them plumped my skin and created a lovely even skin tone.  There is one set of eye masks in the kit and that that were surprisingly light and effective, reducing puffiness and brightening my eyes.  These are a tiny bit pricey, but they’re a nice quality and I like having a set of masks that cover a range of needs."

        "text": "Overall the Karuna 7 Days of Glow mask set has some good masks that do as they say without irritation. While I don't use face masks every day, it has taken me a while to use just a few of them, and specific masks, like the hydration mask, aren't best suited for my face type. Out of the whole set, my favorite masks have been the brightening and antioxidant masks. While I was slightly hesitant to use the antioxidant mask at first due to my oily combo skin, it left me with no clogged pores or irritation, and it brightened and soothed my skin.<br /><br />As I mentioned initially, I don't use face masks too often, and the masks I usually use are pretty cheap. Trying these masks has ruined me a little because it will be hard to go back to my regular masks. The one thing I don't like about these masks is the price. I think $42 is a little bit much for seven face masks, but it depends on how often you use face masks and how much of a splurge you want them to be. in terms of quality, I think the Karuna masks are great."

Compared to lots of different mask brands I've tried there is more than enough fluid and juices in these mask with additional fluid you can spread on after. This is a great item for a gift or to even have a spa night with friends. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS."

These are the cloth style masks which I always find have more serum, better sticking power and a better fit than the hydrogel masks.<br /><br />The eye patches I especially liked.  They're packed full of serum, stay on well and cover the whole under eye and side area.  The brightening face mask did seem to make my skin more even and brighter but it does say not for sensitive skin.  I do sometimes have some sensitivity issues but didn't experience that with any of the masks.<br /><br />There's enough serum in all the masks that you can use the excess the next day as a serum or swipe over your décolletage. I like to keep my masks in the fridge.  They feel great when they're chilled.  This is definitely a product I'll be buying again."

This stuff also never runs out! I use this stuff all the time (no need for over using this thing though) and the bottle feels just as full as it was when I got it!

Definitely recommend for beginners. I only used 2 and 1/2 out of the 7 packs and next time I would make them thicker and use two strands instead of one. I love that it’s already separated  for you. If you were hesitant  about buying the hair, this is your reassurance."

        "text": "Just had my first shave with this. I've used two electric razors in my life. One was an already ancient one that my dad had, about 40 years ago. Ripped each of the few hairs in my face out one by one. Then an early Norelco 3-head circular job, about 30 years ago that either sucked or I didn't know how to use. Very even stubble was the result of that. Hence my refusal to try one until my memories have faded.<br /><br />This review reflects one shave - not a long term review.<br /><br />I'm impressed. It's slower than I expected, I half-thought I could activate an app on my phone or something and I would be shaved (I'm joking!). It's pretty darn close to a manual 5-blade fresh razor.<br /><br />Here are the conditions under which I'm reporting:<br />- I'm 62, so my skin isn't exactly taut on my face.<br />- Not a heavy beard, I need to shave every day now, but not until I was about 35.<br />- This shave was with 2 days of stubble.<br />- I usually shave in the shower, using Braille to tell when a patch is smooth.<br /><br />I used the razor dry. The manual said to charge the razor before first use, but it came out of the box showing 100% charge so I went for it. The manual also says not to apply too much pressure, so I was tentative at first. It helps to apply fair pressure while moving the razor SLOWLY through that fungus that seems to grow constantly on our faces.<br /><br />Stretching my skin with other-handed fingers in most spots helped. I used a mirror just to watch the progress, but you can use your sonic sensors, AKA ears, to tell when the blades are and aren't removing stubble. I don't think a mirror is at all necessary, YMMV.<br /><br />While I've been writing this, I've used Braille again to check on the usual trouble spots - I can just grab the mower and run it over the rough bits while I'm doing this. You could do this easily while driving somewhere - no risk of a small knick, and the aural attention that it takes doesn't really distract from driving.<br /><br />I didn't notice when I ordered this razor that it came with an extra foil. Nice detail, since the foil is easy to damage being thin (as it should be). The kit comes with a carrying bag, which is nice to keep everything together while traveling. I would find a small rigid container for the extra foil if I were to travel with that - it could easily get bent in the carrying bag knocking around with all the bits. The foil is too long for the old canisters from film cameras, but a cut-off from a roll of Xmas paper would suffice.<br /><br />The grip is comfortable and makes the shaving head easy to maneuver. The carrying bag contains everything in a small package - I'm a Cardinal (Archbishops and above don't shave) in the Church of Small Luggage and I will happily carry this instead of a couple of manual razors on any trip.<br /><br />Finally (applause erupts from the crowd),  very nearly close shave as a manual razor, a little slower than a manual razor, works very well dry (absolutely unlike a manual razor, though I've tried that also and it does sort of work).<br /><br />Buy it. Try it."

It felt too loose and watery.<br /><br />I'm not really sure how, but this stuff changes dramatically when you apply it your hair.  It firms right up and makes it very easy to put your hair in place and hold it there.<br /><br />When it drys, it holds well.  It's not as stiff as hair gel and has a little bit of flex, but it should hold up well, unless it's very, very windy outside.<br /><br />A little bit goes a long way.  I don't doubt that this jar will last a few months.  Then again, I don't have a lot of hair.<br /><br />There is not much of a scent and once it's applied, you won't notice it at all.<br /><br />I'd say this is the best pomade I've found and even beats out American Crew in terms of quality and value."

The texture out of the can is at first very creamy, which I thought may affect the holding power, but once I worked in a couple of fingertip sized scoops into my hair, I found that the pomade started to take hold and firm up. My hair held its shape throughout the day and was easy to fix with a comb if needed. When washing it out, despite containing oils and wax, regular shampoo seemed to do the trick. Little to no residue leftover in my hair after a shower."

        "text": "This product has everything I like. A likeable backstory about the founders, produced in small hand crafted patches, and delivers the quality results that it promises.<br /><br />I wear my hair short (buzzed on the sides) with about 3-4 inches on top, which I style differently depending on the day. I usually like it combed to the side, and pushed back, but with volume to give it a nice swoop. My hair is fine, but a lot of it.<br /><br />I’ve never been a fan of pomade in the past because I find it doesn’t hold it’s shape and is too shiny. However, this pomade provides a natural looking shine, while holding my hair in my preferred style. The pomade itself is very light and thin. I didn’t think it would work when applying, but within seconds it began to form my hair into my go-to style. It dries to a “tacky” feel, which allows you to readjust throughout the day, but wouldn’t feel comfortable to run your fingers through it. After applying, the product easily washed off my hands, and out of my hair at the end of the day.<br /><br />The scent is good but not overwhelming. It has the typical “masculine” scent that you will find in deodorants, body wash, shaving cream, etc. for men. The scent lingers till you wash it out.<br /><br />Overall, I will definitely be using up this entire jar."

However around about week 2 the hair began to feel stiff and also started to tangle bad as well. Now here it is not even a whole month has went by and I'm about to take this hair out because its just bad for sew ins. I mean if you are looking to do a quick weave or style that you only want in for at least up to 2 weeks then you might not have a problem with the hair. I'm more concerned with quality and this just doesn't do it for me. This was my first time purchasing hair online it won't be my last however just a different vendor"

They each come in their own sealed plastic bags and then they are all in a nicer zip lock bag with the company's name on it. I wasn't expecting to get so much hair ! I don't do sew ins so I also got some extension clips and I'm going to sew them on to the band at the top of the hair that keeps the hair together and make my own clip on extenripms and I can make them as thick as I want and any length that I want so they will fit my head perfectly ! I can't wait to get started with them. If you're looking for good quality hair extensions I would recommend giving this brand a try. I've had multiple hair extensions and these are some of the nicer ones I've had.<br />***disclaimer I got this product at a discounted price for my unbiased review based on my personal use."

While poking and prodding squeezing my face until bruised at times, I knew there had to be a better way.  I did a little bit of reading and found that many professionals use tools such as this to keep the blemishes under control and &#34;extract&#34; the blemishes.  I decided that I would give it a try and purchase this kit to see how well these tools work. It came in the mail yesterday and so far, I am impressed.  It was nicely packaged in a cellophane bag and the nice case which contains all of the tools.  After trying to familiarize myself with the tools, I went to work. The tools work well, but I do wish that they had come with instructions.  Some of them are self explanatory, but it would be nice to know what tool works best fro which application.  Immediately after &#34;working&#34; I did notice that the area was a bit red, but this dissipated leaving no bruising and a cleaner complexion.  So in practice, I like this kit, but do wish that it came with instructions.  I can see uses for this set beyond blemish extraction, but those uses are beyond the scope of this review.<br />In full disclosure, I did receive this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.  I take this process seriously and only chose to review those items for which my family or I have a real use.

The only thing I would have liked with this kit is a diagram that would explain which tool is best for what, but trial and error and I'm figuring it out.  Also, this is not made for cystic acne (at least from what I've tried).  I like it for what it's good for which is mainly blackheads.

Most of mine are on my nose and cheek areas. Previous to this kit she would use her finger nails and a large needle. We started doing some research and realized that not only where her finger nails not very effective they were damaging skin all around the black head.<br /><br />The tools arrive and she can not wait to give them a try. The are very effective at getting out black head that she would not have been able to do other wise. In one sitting she was able to clean out more black heads then she would normally have been able to do in 3 or more. The tools are strong and sturdy. They do not bend and are easy to grip. The only draw back to this kit is the fact that no instruction are included. The solution for this is that my wife watched many youTube videos. The showed her how to use the different tools on different areas of the face. They also mentioned several point on the need to sanitize the tools before and after use. And gave tips on how to do it.<br /><br />I would recommend this kit to others. It worked very well and i expect it will last.<br /><br />I received a discount on this item or for free in exchange for a thorough and honest review. No additional compensation was provided based on the contents of the review. Regardless I only recommend products I or my family have used personally and and consider to be good.

In writing an honest review, I am not paid to give only positive thoughts on the product. I am not being paid at all. I am just reviewing the product. I will be offering my true thoughts on the product, my positives and negatives. Thank you.<br />The price is amazing for this product. I bought just one of these tools in the shop and it cost $5 for one! This comes with 5 different styles and it came in a case! Pretty awesome if you ask me. I have gotten my blackhead and pimples removed by a professional at a salon before. They use the same products that are in this kit. At the salon, they would first use a hot steamer to help open your pores. They place a hot towel on your face as well. Then they would pop your blackheads and applied a little bit of pressure. Afterwards, it is important to clean the area and wash your face. I really like this product and it good to use a professional tool then using your finger nails. Always make sure your face and hands are clean too! 10/10 for this product and the cute case that comes along with it too!"

I can put it on a few minutes before bed, and not worry about getting oil or lotion all over the sheets. I’ve been using it mostly on my legs and arms, but also made a point to use it on my hands and cuticles, and my hands felt great. I think it will be really good this winter as the air gets drier.<br /><br />I did not, however, like this in my hair. Oils usually work really well in my hair, but I felt like the scent changed almost immediately after putting it on. I smelled a rancid smell, which it does not have in the bottle, and my hair and scalp were clean. Perhaps it’s just my body chemistry, but I was not a fan of this use.<br /><br />A couple of other things that I wanted to mention that I think are important to know before you buy this:<br /><br />1. Peppermint and Eucalyptus Essential oils are not recommended on children under the age of six and 10 respectively, so I would not use this on babies or toddlers despite the recommendation on the insert. Children under the age of two should generally avoid topical use of any essential oil. Yes, the oils in this product appear to be highly diluted, but I wouldn’t chance it. They are still smelling it even if you’re not putting it on them.<br /><br />2. I’m hesitant to use anything with essential oils as an “intimate” lubricant as recommended. Too much potential (in my mind) for mucosal membrane damage, and no, I’m not talking about your nose. Also, oil-based lubricants will break down latex, so be aware of this.<br /><br />Other than the above concerns I mentioned (which are not concerns if you are using it correctly) I really like using this moisturizer. I will definitely continue to enjoy it."

When I first got it, it sprayed a lovely fine mist but as I used it more, the spray didn't work as well.  Not a deal breaker, it's an oil blend, won't always spray perfect but I was bummed.  Also, wasn't sure what a \"dry oil\" meant but as I used it, I realized that it must mean less greasy finish, which it is.  I rub from head to toe and can almost immediately put my clothes on.  I have some scratches on my arms and this oil has helped them heal, and since using, almost completely gone.  A sign of a good healthy oil.  I have very dry over-flat-ironed hair, and after rubbing on my arms, I run my hands through my hair.  LOVE it on my hair.  I have put on my hair a couple days in a row, before washing, and never felt greasy.  You just have to adjust the amount to how dry your hair is.  The buds in it are a very nice touch, but not sure if they had an effect on the spray, maybe blocking it?  When the spray went flat, I opened the bottle to release the pressure, and tightly capped it again.  Helped a little.  Now I just spray it into my hands rub it in by hand.  All in all, this moisturizing oil is amazing and delivers what is advertised.  I love that it can literally be used head-to-toe, I rub on my toes, body, and end with my hair."

I don’t usually need it or any lotion again until my next shower. Love it!"

E oil, over the counter hydrocortisone cream, and just about anything else I read might help. A friend suggested this. I tried it for one week and it did nothing for my eczema. I also got a bad scratch from my pet during this time, so I tried it on that as well. Nope... still scarred.<br /><br />Honestly, I think Vit. E oil worked better. Save your money and try that instead. This product is worthless and pricy!"

I was never really a super hairy but loved the feeling of being totally hairless from head to toe.<br /><br />With all the sessions and hrs i barley have any hair but do have some spots on thighs, arms and other spots, that are fairly light even with all the professional laser treatments and electrolysis.  IPL aka this device is NOT the go-to treatment for hair reduction but it does work.<br /><br />Firstly, you need to use an electric razor or standard razor on the areas your zapping.  Freshly showered, no oils or lotions on skin.  If you dont feel heat your not killing hair follicles.  The laser targets the pigment in the hair and absorbs the heat, so as they stated vampire skin, dark hair gets the best results.<br /><br />If you have never gotten any sort of  pro hair removal your hair is going to be fuller and courser.  Like the subject heading states, ive had 28 full body laser hair removal treatments aka real hair removal that leaves you with red bumps, plus hrs of electrolysis and I still have hair grow back.<br /><br />People it takes a long time to remove hair!  This is not designed to be a one zap and the hair is gone.  It will grow back finer and weaker, until it eventually is killed off.  It literally takes years.<br /><br />I zap each spot 5 times on the highest setting.  The heat will build on each subsequent zap, meaning im actually hitting follicles.  I would not recommend this if you have course hair or never had pro hair removal - build up to that, but this device is a nice supplement to the pro hair removal.  It will never replace it and will take longer. For me its perfect and thats why i gave it 5 stars.<br /><br />Once you zap the hair you should see a reaction, raised bumps, some redness, along the bikini line for example its very noticeable since the hair is courser - that means its working.  It takes about 10 -14 days for the zapped hair to push its way out.  Its not instant, the hair still remains in the follicle.  You can expedite this by lightly exfoliating in the bath or shower.  You may see little black spots in the follicle where the hair has been zapped and effectively targeted.<br /><br />Hair grows in cycles, doing this every week is pointless, if the hair is not in the growth phase you cant kill it. Every 4 weeks, multiple zaps per spot and the hair WILL fall out and come back weaker.  Different areas have different growth cycles but 4 weeks is a good middle ground.<br /><br />  This is used for hair reduction.  If you want permanent (still takes multiple treatments( you need electrolysis.<br /><br />If you want faster hair reduction result you need to use laser only found at the dermatologist or reputable laser spa.  IPL is not laser treatment. This is not going to ever replace that.  A combination of all three over 3 or 4  years will leave you hairless, so keep your expectations realistic."

I read the description and thought about whether or not they would work with my daughters hair and to my surprise even when it is not slicked back you can see the tips of the horns sticking out of her hair. Personally I think that is a better touch. They look good with curly, straight, or smoothed back hair. They stood up to her wearing them all day but she did find that while on the dance floor they stayed put but if she was to head bang they came lose. Given that they are only clipped in I didn't expect them to work too well during a head banging session but I guess she wanted to make sure she fully tried them out. Overall she thinks they are one of the best finds for her hair accessory collection and is very pleased with them."

This product fits the bill, it has a really clean scent that is subtle but really nice and not noticeable after your shower. The pump bottle is really nice and makes it easy to get the perfect amount. This lathers nicely in the beard and rinses easily leaving your beard feel clean without drying out your face. This product will prevent unsightly \"bearddruff\" and do a great job of preventing beard itch while you're still rocking the apprentice beard and works well even when an adequate beard has been grown. When you have enough beard this product seems to help prevent frizz and keeps your beard looking neat between trims. This product is designed as a cleanser and should be combined with a good oil and balm for proper care especially for long beards.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Clean scent<br />Anti friz<br />Anti beardruff<br />Lathers easily<br /><br />Cons:<br />Wish the bottle was a bit bigger"

I plugged him in a gave it a try and I had was in a completely different world of shaving, I had a much better closer more comfortable shave than I have ever experienced before without the skin irritation and accidental nicks and cuts that come with top of the line blades.<br />I can shave without a mirror and anywhere there is a electrical outlet and if I am running late for work in the morning I just hurry and plug it in and mow it over my face for about 30 seconds and I am out the door and still get a close shave without all the mess and water.<br />Results with this razor are excellent.<br />1- Clean close comfortable shave.<br />2- Convenient no mess shave.<br />3- less expensive than disposible blades yet with a better shave.<br />In closing after almost 30 years of using disposable blades I will never go back to them and I have had this little tropper for about 4 years without replacing new blades for it and I still get a really comfortable clean shave I just give it a good cleaning once a month.<br />This Norelco is a very good shaving system and it is not just the electric razor method itself because I have tried other electric shavers along with this one and they did not in anyway compare to the results that I get from the Reflex Plus.<br />Bravo Norelco and thank you for a excellent product.<br /><br />Mike"

For about the same amount I would have spent to replace the worn parts on my old razor (not even including the cost of replacing the battery), I got a brand new Norelco razor!<br /><br />The first thing I noticed about the Norelco is that it's MUCH quieter than my old Panasonic.  My Panasonic sounded like a Dustbuster when it was on.  Another plus to the Norelco is that it does a much better job of shaving underneath my jaw line and on my neck.  I have not had any problem with the cord coming out of the razor while shaving.  It fits in there nice and snug.  I also have had no problem with the razor grabbing my skin.  Just make sure you don't press down too hard on your skin while shaving, and use your free hand to pull your skin tight while shaving your neck, as suggested in the accompanying booklet.<br /><br />If you don't need a fancy, expensive razor that cleans itself or is rechargeable, give this one a try."

Instead of the<br />recommended cleaning every two weeks, I just remove the head<br />every weekend and tap the head and body against the sink a few<br />times.<br /><br />As other reviewers noted, the cord is tightly coiled and stiff.<br />Every few months it pulls free from the shaver enough to remove<br />power, but not enough to fall off. This inconvenience adds several<br />seconds to my shave time.<br /><br />If it was lost, I'd probably replace it with the same model.<br /><br />Added, January 2008: Late last year I finally noticed the shave was<br />not as close as it had been, and it took longer. Time to replace<br />the head. Norelco recommends every year; I can confirm that two years<br />is too long. Replacing the entire thing was less than $3.00 more than<br />replacing just the head, so I really have bought it again."

It's lightweight and a nice color and the cord seems heavier duty than my previous straightener and it doesn't tangle like my old one which is a major plus. The auto-shut off is a must.

It have a very nice LCD display that is very easy to read. This is a 1 inch ceramic tourmaline flat iron.

I really do like the scent though. It’s a little bit citrusy and very light. The other bottle of stuff has a slightly spicy scent to it but it’s not overpowering. I will say that there were no English directions included with this, so I had to end up going online to find out whether or not I was supposed to wash out the other bottle and you are in fact, supposed to rinse it out after you put it in and let it sit for six seconds. Neither of these felt particularly oily to me, so I was a little disappointed with how greasy my hair felt after I dried it. I’m not sure if you’re using a blow dryer made a difference or not. Usually I let my hair dry but I was anxious to see the results. after I’ve used it a few more times I’ll update my review one way or the other as to whether I like it or whether it’s making my hair greasy."

Certainly oily shampoo than normal but the oil is really helping reduce the dryness of the hair which is the reason the hair is prone to split and damage. The ampoule is easy to use, use after shampooing and just massage it in for about a min before rinsing off. I wish there is an English manual to help explaining the instruction because the box and bottles only have Korean instructions."

It’s not something I use daily, but once or twice a week keeps my hair from drying out so much. I have fine, naturally curly hair that I dry with a diffuser several times a week. The heat leaves my hair dry. This oil shampoo smells like peaches to me, lathers well and washes out cleanly leaving me with soft, shiny, curls.  It’s too heavy for me for daily use, but as a moisturizing treatment, it’s wonderful! My hair really does look better when I use it, but after it’s almost too soft to style. I usually make it part of my Saturday wash routine and once more during the week if needed.  The ampoule is an excellent for de tangling, and it actually helps with the seborrheic dermatitis I get around my hairline that flakes and itches. If your hair is dry or damaged, this is a great repair treatment that I definitely recommend!"

Other 'sellers' seem to sell at a lower price than the original manufacturer pricing. That's my .2cents."

Based on feedback from a Sonicare customer service rep, I recently replaced it with the more basic Sonicare Essence e5500 model; but it was big, clunky and noisy, so I returned it.

        "text": "Perfect for my 24in long thick, coarse, tangled, color treated wavy-curly hair. I HATE brushing my hair. I’m 39 and worse than my 10year old niece when it comes to brushing hair. I recently developed dry scalp and hair breakage due to cold Minnesota weather and I was told this style of brush with regular brushing would help. But many reviews of other prices similar to this for hair similar to mine said the brushes we bad for detaingling. I had no issues with this brush. In fact this brush detangles better than any other brush I’ve owned including a brush that was combo boars hair with the nylon bristles and advertised for thick hair. My hair was not static afterwards like the other brush leaves it, my hair does create breakage like the other brush does, and it was immediately softer and shinier.<br /><br />For those that are looking for a hairbrush and not a beard brush, this is a  little on the small side. But that doesn’t make a difference and the size is not ineffective for my thick hair. This was another pleasant surprise given the massive amount of hair I have. I did know I was buying a beard brush so I knew it would be somewhat smaller. And truthfully, I didn’t read the full product description to know the exact size I was purchasing so that was my fault. I am definitely not displeased though. It is also a cheaper price than other brushes so the price plus small size means that I will can but a second one to put in my travel bag!<br /><br />The other feature that I really like is that it does not have that rubber face that other brushes use to embed the bristles. I like that this face is entirely wood because I feel like water will not collect underneath when cleaning it potentially making it moldy. It also makes the bristles appear more firmly attached which hopefully will create less Bristle loss in the long run."

If it dries in between coats it gets clumpy. To remove you really need to use warmer water and keep splashing it on. It will kind of melt off your lashes. If you force it you’ll end up losing the ends of your natural lashes. Once you get the hang of using it, it’s great."

I was able to practice a couple of times before the climb, but on the climb was the first time I had used it outdoors and in a place where I would be unable to clean up if things went wrong. I used it 3-4 times on the 13 hour climb, and it was successful each time. Given that there were men climbing ahead, behind, and with me, and because of the frigid temperatures, I was grateful not to have to disrobe to pee, and I didn't have any problems with dripping. I followed the instructions to scrape off when finished, and was able to clean the device somewhat in the snow afterward. I kept it in a zippered pouch made of recycled plastic, which kept it clean and away from my other things.<br /><br />I was pleased with this device.

It does feel weird after a lifetime of conditioning to pee standing up wearing my jeans still pulled up, but I have never so much as gotten a drop on myself.

I washed the hair once with a shampoo that contains no alcohol or sulfates and no other harsh chemicals. I also deep conditioned with Coconut Milk by OGX thinking that would help the dry ends of this hair. Well let me tell you it did not help. The ends are still dry and the hair is starting to shed at the ends more than what it did last week. I have only used heat on the hair twice and both times I used a non alcohol heat protectant. I condition this hair every two days with OGX weightless coconut oil and I braid it at night before bed. I use wide tooth comb and barely ever brush the hair. I usually just finger comb and I have lightly brushed the hair maybe 2-3 times since installing. I don't understand why the ends are so dry considering  I have barely used heat and apply coconut oil to the ends of the hair every 2 days. I will not purchase this hair again because its just not very good quality and I would like my money back.<br /><br />Update: as of 10/04/16. I have conditioner washed this hair again with OGX Coconut Milk and used OGX Hair Serum on the ends of the hair. The hair does okay after you wash it and let it air dry. The hair also holds a curl very well and looks refreshed after washing and conditioning. The ends of the hair don't look dry if you apply heat to the hair. However, constant heat will dry the hair out so I try not to apply much heat at all. The ends go back to being dry after a few days and I still have to constantly spray coconut oil to maintain the ends. The hair continues to shed but its not that bad, you just have to keep the hair moisturized and it won't shed that much."

Wrote to the dealer and felt they gave the the run around.  Now the KNEE cushion has cracked and a piece is torn off the side of the cushion.  In conversing with the company i found out this scooter was MADE IN CHINA. I guess you get what you pay for. Buy cheap  and it falls apart.  Will have to duct tape the cushion to try and protect it from further cracking.  Have a minimum of another 4 weeks of use on this scooter and am wondering if this scooter and the knee cushion will hold up.<br />I can also supply a video if needed of the wobbling which makes the steering difficult if you roll the scooter from a flat surface onto a carpet or over a doorway jam.  My advise..........pay more from a manufacture which builds in the USA and NOT CHINA!"

Plus, they don't seem to lose their softness after many uses. The textured side is great for applying toner or removing exfoliating products like sugar scrubs, etc. The soft side is pretty absorbent, so you may find you have to apply more product if you are using them to put on toner or something. They also wrinkle easily when using them, so it took me a few uses before I figured out how to hold them without having them instantly scrunch up in my hands when I used them, but now that I have the hang of it, they work great!"

I use it and then after it dries I immediately put on another moisturizer.  I also use it now with my derma roller to get the best results for increasing the collagen and elastin in my skin.

        "text": "It is often claimed that periorbital dark circles are caused by tiredness or working too hard or even just staying up late. While this can be true, the truth is that your genes play a huge role here. So what exactly is happening when you get dark circles under or around your eyes?<br /><br />Simply put, periorbital dark circles are a result of the thin layer of skin below your eyes showing the blood vessels and the blood they contain more clearly than anywhere else on your body. (For reference, this skin around your eyelids, called periorbital skin, is on average about 0.5 mm thick compared to an average of about 2 mm thick on most of the rest of your body.)<br /><br />Now, as you may or may not already know, the reason veins often look blue isn’t because the blood inside them is blue; it’s because your skin/subcutaneous tissue only lets blue/violet wavelengths of light pass through it. As a result, only blue light is reflected back and the veins look, well, bluish. (Veins often won’t appear blue if a person has darker or lighter skin. Rather, the veins tend to appear green or brown. On the other hand, people with extremely light skin, such as albinos, will typically have veins that show up as dark purple or dark red, more closely resembling the actual color of the blood running through the veins.)<br /><br />It’s the exact same concept with the skin below your eyes. Those dark bluish circles are (usually) just the result of light being reflected back off of the blood vessels sitting just below the surface of that incredibly thin patch of skin. This is the same reason facial bruises are more prominent below or around the eyes; the thin skin just shows the blood from the ruptured blood vessels a little bit more clearly.<br /><br />Again, as you may or may not know, as we age, our skin loses its elasticity and ability to regenerate and as a result, it becomes thinner. This is why more often than not, elderly people will have rather prominent periorbital dark circles regardless of how much they sleep. As with those who are genetically predisposed to having thinner skin below the eyes, it’s just biology."

I noticed my results start to take place after about 4 days of continually using it once a day. I also was using it on my neck and chest area and it helps to firm up your skin and keep it smooth and supple. Who doesn't want that?

        "text": "Some products for treating calluses on the feet are too harsh (chemical sloughing lotion or gels) or too greasy (foot balms, creams).  As a diabetic, it doesn't take long for calluses to form on the bottom of my feet--especially the heels, the sides, and the bottom of the toes.  I soak my feet in a foot spa once a month with warm water and Epsom salt (any \"spa\" variety: tea tree, lavender, peppermint, menthol) and use a fine emery board to gently abrade the hard calluses.  The Epsom salt is what makes the calluses to slough off, and the fine emery board helps speed the sloughing process.<br /><br />In between soakings, I try to keep ahead of the stubborn callus growth by using the products mentioned above.  Always looking for something \"better\" and a callus remover that wasn't prone to burn the delicate skin near the calluses, I found this:  Major Pharmaceuticals' \"Ammonium Lactate 12% Moisturizing Cream.\"<br /><br />Ammonia lactate is a natural moisturizer of the skin.  It's an acid, which is primarily the reason it works to get rid of accumulated dead, dry skin cells.  So that the acid doesn't irritate the skin, the lactic acid is neutralized with ammonium hydroxide.  The result is a cream that is deliberately neutralized to a comfortable, human-friendly pH of 4.5 to 5.5.<br /><br />The key ingredient is ammonia lactate.  It's the stuff that does away with dry, flaky skin, dead surface skin cells, and (what else but dead surface skin is calluses).<br /><br />The cream doesn't just remove dead, dry skin cells, leaving your skin bare and raw, like some products do.  To protect your skin, the cream contains a number of emollients to hydrate, soften, and exfoliate dry and rough skin.<br /><br />Directions suggest applying the cream on dry skin twice a day.  \"Slow and steady wins the race!\" the tortoise said to the hare.  It's good advice in this instance.  Harsh chemical sloughing lotions will quickly dissolve calluses, but it does so at the risk of burning and irritating proximal healthy skin.  This cream works over a period of time that makes it safe for your skin.  But in as little as three days, your feet will feel better, will look clearer, and seem softer.<br /><br />I recommend this product."

The pumps were better and worked but they were hard to prime.  The BEST OPTION FOR PRIMING thick shampoo was to pump water in them first then the thick shampoo flowed into the pump better.<br /><br />Another bottle was USED FOR OIL and it leaked oil out of the pump when sitting upright with both sets of pumps. Seller said these are good for lotion, gel, soap, or something that is not too thick or too thin. She is sending me another set of bottle with disc caps that will work better for my intended use.<br /><br />Updated star rating for GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE and WILLING TO MAKE THE CUSTOMER HAPPY."

I cannot  really tell if it contributed to well health of my hair because I completely changed my entire hair care routine. In addition to this cap, I made a DIY  hair masks, treatments, oils, and I am taking biotin liquid 10000 mcg, collagen peptides.<br />So, since that moment (August 2018), my hair is more beautiful, fuller, and my curls are well defines.<br /><br />However, I really don't like the way this hair cap works. I don't feel the warmth.<br />It looks like the company changed the quality of the product. That is why the price has reduced. It is better to have a great quality product at the higher price than having a bad quality at cheap price.<br /><br />PS: I am black, and I have natural kinky hair.<br /><br />How do I use this cap?<br />1- After plugging it, I set to high setting. Leave it for 15min (following instructions); then put on head. I usually keep it on my head for between 30-45min (when doing prepoo, oils treatment,). I turn it off, then unplug.<br />2- I wash my hair (with my DIY shampoo), put either conditioner or hait mask. Then, I use again the cap (same process like on the 1st step, but keep the cap this time for grand max 20min).<br /><br />If someone uses it differently and is satisfied of the results, please share your experience. It could be benefit for me as well.<br /><br />Thanks"

All gel polishes were tightly sealed, with no leaks, and came with application instructions. Disappointingly, these were the only positives factors. First, the bottles are made of cheap-feeling plastic, which surprised me. Second, the gel consistencies were just too thick, especially the glitter gels, note room temperature was a steady 72 degrees. Thus, I decided right then and there, the Mocmaki gel polishes were not for me.<br /><br />There are a few honorable mentions however, all the colors were very vibrant and highly pigmented. The white and red applied the best, both brushed on smoothly and had a nice opaqueness after just one application, I still went ahead with a second coat, nonetheless.<br /><br />Although not a professional nail tech, I do have over 6 years of DIY experience and have used many different gel polish brands throughout the years. The Mocmaki gels are by far my least favorite, but given the few bright spots mentioned, they earned at least 3 stars. Worth the price given the quantity, mmm sorry to say not so much."

You will get the same results if you heat up the strip with your hands it just takes a few minutes to be ready. Also, make sure you let your hair grow at a fair length 😉."

Easy to see exactly how much is pumped.  It makes other &#34;clear&#34; products seem ordinary.  One drop is completely adequate to cover my face, neck and tops of hands.  There is no sticky or oily residue, and the serum absorbs quickly into the skin. No lengthy massage needed, which I have no patience for. I have no specific skin issues other than normal aging, so I can't speak to any corrective properties.  For me, this product works well as part of my daily skin care practice to maintain skin health.  The packaging is unique and elegant (although the written suggested use of 3-4 pumps is excessive). I thought the price might be too high, but testing the actual coverage from one pump, I believe this is a great value for money.  Highly recommend."

Both the ionic and the massage components are not strong enough to have any effect whatsoever. The only good thing I paid $6-7 for this, so its too much trouble to return it at this point.  Will probably remove batteries and use as regular brush."

I don’t recommend doing this when you just get out of the shower as it does take longer for your hair to dry using the hair wrap. Also if you want all day stay your gonna need to run some moose through your hair before wrapping it, still 100 times better for your hair than curling  with heat. I have way too much hair for this, if I try this with wet hair (only works for me with product in my hair) it literally takes 10 hours to dry."

I purchased it after yet another [[ASIN:B000063SLR WaterPik WP-60W Personal Dental Water Jet System]] broke (I've gone through several), and I was looking for an alternative to a countertop model.  I looked at some of the other faucet-based oral irrigators (e.g., [[ASIN:B0028OV2S0 RediBreeze, Oral Irrigator]]), but decided on the Glacier Floss instead because of its magnet.  I may write an update to this review after my dentist appointment, if he comments on any reduced plaque or tartar.<br /><br />I like the lack of a reservoir - not having one makes it so easy to use, and more sanitary.  Even though there is no pulsation, the pressure actually seems stronger than the WaterPik.  I use it in conjunction with dental floss, and my teeth feel great afterwards.<br /><br />The product was also easy to install, and there are no leaks so far.

Since I am at someone else's home, I can't keep asking them to produce a wrench each time I want to use it, and they won't allow me to keep the unit attached.<br /><br />So, when I spent the night at a hotel, I took the device with me. I was hoping that every faucet tip is not as securely attached as the one at my in-laws. No such luck.<br /><br />Every other hotel (I tested 3 so far) I have been to is the same. My husband travels with me, and even he could not loosen the faucet tips by hand. Unless you are willing to carry a wrench with you, this oral irrigator is not a good choice for portability.<br /><br />As far as the function, it worked ok the one time I was able to use it. The pressure was so-so but I didn't really expect that much from a portable unit.<br /><br />I had some trouble getting the temperature right. Every time I would switch back to faucet mode, the irrigator would run only cold water afterward, until I turned both spigots off, reopened them, then waited a few seconds. However, that may just be the particular faucet that I used.<br /><br />In sum, I am unable to use this product. It's a shame that I cannot recommend it, as I had high hopes for it."

I wear a size 7 glove which is a large in ladies gloves, I wear a size 9 shoe and I'm 5'8&#34;....you may wonder why I told you that? Well, hands are relative to feet and height. My hand is just under 3 1/2 inches wide at its widest and these fit me perfect. Many people said they fit big and that worried me. SO IF you are short with little feet, these will probably fit you big. They will stretch and I would expect them to fit a glove size 8... and 9, which is huge for a woman, but pretty standard for a man. They will be big if you wear small or medium gloves."

I did not see anything similar to this in the U.S. yet.<br /><br />Deodorant lasts all day.

The only deodorant without aluminum that would work temporally, not making me stink was Milk of Magnesia, however, once you sweat you have to wash and reapply again. It works, but the white stuff gets on your clothes and makes a mess. This one does not last 48hrs for sure, however, it does last until I start sweating on my workout. So I reapply a little bit more, before working out and holds well. My 12 years-old daughter, it is a mini-stinky-me, and it works pretty well for her and she is happy, because she does not want to have aluminum on her deodorant! I would recommend. It has a nice scent, and if you are not all day outdoors in a high humid environment such as in South Florida, you will like the results!"

I have a heavy beard that it about 2 inches long and used the oil 2 to 3 times a day for a week and used between 3 and 4 pumps each time.  I suppose if you have a very dry beard and you are not using shampoo and conditioner when you shower this may help.<br /><br />I also tried it in my hair once after a shower - it made me feel VERY greasy and about 2 hours later I had to take another shower to get it out.  I don't recommend trying that at all.<br /><br />I received this product at discount in exchange for my honest review."

This beard oil definitely has helped to reduce the coarseness of my beard and coupled with combing my beard not only looks better, it is less tangled and easier to maintain. Less than a week after I started using it a couple of times a day (again with combing) a male friend commented on how nice and full my beard looked and asked what I had done. The fragrance isn't over powering, but I can't use this on my mustache before bed...I must lick my lips during my sleep or something because I woke up with the taste in my mouth. This is reasonably priced and it works. Try it!"

Also, the scent- if you like very floral orangey smell this will be great for you ( but for me it was perceived as migraine-inducing floral overkill with floor wax cleaner smell) The scent is very strong and does not fade.

It doesn't matter its a great price, it stayed on all day through work and all night trick-or-treating! And before that it stayed on all night at a club dancing! As with any wig it was a relief to take off at the end but I did so with fondness for it.  You can see in the photos that I bobbypinned the front back slightly so my face tattoos would be more visible. The curls stayed nice & shapely even after gently brushing. 10/10 would buy again!"

For me, powder was the worst choice.<br /><br />Since most beauty products cater to oily or combination skin,  I imagine that those of us with truly dry skin are more of a minority and so it's reasonable that this won't work for a lot of people.<br /><br />But if you're like me and you could probably cover your face in olive oil and think, &#34;damn, now my skin looks nice&#34;, this might be for you.  It is truly the only thing I've used that doesn't make my concealer or foundation crepe.<br /><br />One reviewer compared it to Vaseline, which it is definitely not.  However, I can see where she was coming from.  It's thick and oily and just what my skin needs.  It also lasts longer than any dermatologist would recommend keeping it for.

It's been raining since April in Texas and this means a lot. If you want bigger curls, you can part more hair in a curler and leave it longer. I'd recommend some light weight hair spray to hold them. Specially for front part of hair. Overall, I was tired of damaging hair with curling irons over times and I'm happy to find curlers that's light and I can sleep in them."

My tips.. have your face nice and clean, make your face taut wheever you are doing it, after you are all done.. I use that green anti bump shave gel.. rinse your fac4e with warm water, pat dry, then put a little on your hands and then glide all over your face and neck.. or whereever you did it on your face.. this will prevent bumps.. and hey.. no makeup or harsh chemicals  creams etc the rest of the day.. unless you want bumps.. so there you go.. :)"

Then I compared them to each other the set actually comes in different sizes and different gap (space between each end). Then I compared them to the other headbands I got, this one is short of about an inch on both sides for its largest size. The quality also differs from one another, some are really well made, some are loosely fitted and not well attached. The headband is wrapped with silk black lining and topped with colorful knotted cloth of velvet and chiffon materials.  With regards to the fitting, The ones with a very narrow gap tends to be painful overtime, other just causes minor discomfort at the back of the ears. Color variations are cute though and can really give a pop of color to an outfit. Price point wise is very affordable and ideal for gifting."

        "text": "Since I have a lot of thick hair, I typically let it air dry, as it takes too long for me to blow dry it out, and it gets too hot.  (I can only get the rubber band around my hair twice.) My hair is frizzy and is somewhat wavy at the ends.  It normally takes me 45 min to straighten my hair, after it has been air dried out.  The Jose Eber Digital Straitening Brush cut down the time dramatically!  It took me between 10-20 minutes to straighten my hair.  After letting my hair dry out overnight, it took me 10 minutes to straighten my hair, and I did not have any hair products in my hair!  It took me the maximum of 20 minutes, to straighten my hair, after being left in a braid and bun all day.  During that time, I used thermal heat protectant, and when I use heat protectant, I don’t spray a large amount.  I do a few quick spritzes on my entire head, and then brush it through.<br />As with any electrical equipment, read the instructions.  The instructions were clear, and made the brush very easy to use.  The digital display is easy to read and see.  The instructions make it easy to switch the temperature setting from Celsius to Fahrenheit.  The temperature settings are from 320 degrees Fahrenheit to 450 degrees Fahrenheit.  The brush is not bulky, and it’s not heavy.<br />As recommended in the instructions, brush sections of the hair for easy and proper straightening.  When I sectioned my thick hair, I was able to quickly straighten it.  I used the straightener on the highest setting, and my hair did not smell like burnt hair.  Normally when I use other straighteners, I am hesitant to start right next to the root, as I have been burned before from the steam of a typical hair straightener.  I was able to safely and easily straighten my bangs with it, as the red silicone caps protect your scalp, and doesn’t burn your head.  Even though I had the Jose Eber Digital Straightening Brush on the highest heat setting, my hair was not hot to touch.  When using other typical hair straighteners on the highest setting, I tend to get the horizontal line from the flat irons’ plates idling a tad too long, on a section of the hair.  Since this is a brush hair straightener, I did not have any horizontal lines!  The brush made my hair smooth, and easy to brush through with my fingers.  I love this straightening brush.  It works wonders!"

It gives you the feeling of elegance and luxury.<br /><br />The lip balm itself takes effect immediately, you will feel your lips smooth and flexible right away, it is almost an overwhelming sensation in the first couple of seconds. It has a nutty smell and taste, I would actually gladly spread it over bread for breakfast. it feels natural and edible. It reminds me of the freshly made cookies of grandma.

The lavender and unscented varieties do not cause a breakout like this, so perhaps it's just this oil. I've been antiperspirant free for a long time, so I doubt this is an adjustment issue."

The applicator was nice, it worked well and was easy to use.  My daughter has frizzy hair and was really looking forward to this.  It does work, but it's such a small bottle!<br /><br />Overall, it works well but there's cheaper and bigger sized alternatives out there.  This is so expensive for what it is, currently $19.99 for a little 8 ml bottle.  I just couldn't justify getting this again.<br /><br />This would be okay for minor touch-ups but if you have frizzy hair, try something else that's cheaper, and bigger."

During in the summer I tend to wear my hair pulled back in a ponytail, and always find that I have those stray flyaway hairs. This easily and quickly takes care of them. Just pull out the wand, tame them down using the tip of the wand, and go about your business. Holds for the better part of the day. You will need to reapply every now and then, but it doesn’t leave your hair feeling oily or weighed down. Definitely some thing I’ll continue to use."

I have a hard time getting past that fact. I thought oh boy this better be good for the price.<br /><br />So this is pretty much identical in both applicator and size to a lip gloss. I like the idea of the applicator being mess free something you can carry in your pocket and do a quick touch up on the go without putting product on your hands. The gel itself isn’t sticky and doesn’t dry with any “crunch” to it. Which is both good and bad. It’s not overly heavy for quick touch ups. But for someone like me with really curly frizzy hair this provides no lasting power. You can hardly tell I used it a short while after application.<br /><br />I’d say all in all you can buy a whole bottle of lightweight hair gel (basically all this is) for about 1/10 of the price. I wouldn’t purchase this in the future."

I used Nair strips before this and they always did a great job, but decided to give these a try. Not even close.

And both products smell so, so good. It was really important to me to find products that were cruelty free and when I wrote the seller to ask, Shelley got back to me right away and said yes they are a cruelty free company!

I previously was using the Terre de Mars coffee/aloe scrub and I got GREAT results (soft, matte skin after washing off with near complete resolution of my frequent forehead breakouts), so I wanted to give this coffee product a try when I saw it for comparison. From a smell standpoint it's fine (like sweet coffee but with a saltiness to it), and texture-wise it does have some grit behind it to feel like you're getting a good scrub when you apply it (can see the sea salt). As I noted earlier though, it is QUITE sticky, and the dark color of the coffee can be a bit difficult to get off your skin (I follow the scrub w/ a cleanser and thorough rinse after which gets it all off without too much mess). I haven't used it long enough to say it's really making a big difference, but the few times I did use it I did feel like my skin was softer than before, so that's a good sign."

I was a little nervous about rinsing it down the drain in my tub, but I was glad to find that the coffee bean and cacao (listed in the ingredients) are incredibly fine and it is only the salt that is the rough material, so it dissolves and rinses away just fine. Because of the natural ingredients, there’s separation, but it can easily be mixed prior to use. I took a photo to show where the ingredients are located on the container. It was a little messy since the scrub is dark brown - it looks exactly like the product pictures. It leaves skin smelling slightly like pure dark chocolate. I scrubbed one arm and not the other to compare and it really gets rid of bumps and uneven skin texture. It was not irritating or too rough, it felt nice. Some sugar scrubs just dissolve quickly and are too greasy, but because these salt crystals are more coarse, they do scrub (hate to use the word scratch) away excess stuff on the skin’s surface. When mixed, it also was not too greasy and did not cause my tub to be left oily after showering off the scrub. I’m interested in seeing how this continues to improve my skin with continued use."

Make sure to clean the shower/tub after use because it will leave a mess behind if you're not careful with it. It's packaged really well so no leaks or anything.

The sponge applicator comes to a small point and I was surprised to be able to do a pseudo wing shape at the outer corner. You do need to use a blending brush to work the fade and I also do a transition color using another brush. I do find it quicker than using  brushes and powder alone, but since you have to re-dip for more powder even when it's brand new, I'm wondering how much effort it's gonna be once the product starts to get used up. You will probably have to not only twist the sponge applicator all the way back into the cap to pick up more, but also tap it to release more powder onto the appllicator. That would be annoying.<br />The color is pretty - a lighter, brighter purple than I expected. Overall, I'd say it's ok. Not great, not awful. For $5 I don't mind that I picked it up and I will keep it."

My favorite polish is by another company in a rose gold.<br /><br />The photos included for this polish clearly look rose gold. Sure, different monitors, screens, etc etc, but everything else has been spot on, EXCEPT this polish.<br /><br />First off, I love the rubberized top. It makes it so easy to handle. The polish itself flowed well and went on smoothly.<br /><br />My beef is the huge color difference. I've already opened it, I can't return it. It totally looks rosy and pearlized in the photos on Amazon. BUT, in reality, it is mauve, nearly purple. The color name is \"Pinky Promise\", so the minimum I expected was a shade of pink. They should change the name to \"Purple Promise\", which would be much more accurate. It is so different, I thought maybe I was sent the wron bottle. But the sticker on the bottom has the right name. Maybe someone messed with stickers?<br /><br />It is not a horrible color, but not what I wanted, and very dark for me. Very disappointing. The quality is ok, but the shade is WAY off from the photo and name.<br /><br />UPDATE: Found the weakness in this polish. Despite it being so dark, I wanted to test the \"breathable\" polish, as I'd never tried it. I have to say that it lasted really well. I put it on with no bottom or top coat, just the polish. It was still going strong, no chips or flaking, four days later.<br />Until I did a big batch of dishes.<br />I usually wear gloves to wash dishes (yes, sadly, we have no dishwasher where we live. It's like the 1950's). However, I wanted to test the polish, so wore my usual glove on my right hand, and no glove on the left.<br />Water, for prolonged time, is this polish's kryptonite! I added a photo. All the polish came off the ends when my nails got super wet and soft.<br />But I will say the polish lasted much longer than my usual brand (Hansens)."

Initially I thought it only had a stream and off option despite what the descriptions say, but if you turn the nozzle slightly from the off position, you'll be able to get a mist from the water bottle when you spray. I used this for ironing and if I were to use the bottle for cleaning, I'd use the stream option. Be careful not to turn the nozzle too much or else when you spray it, it will stream, but water will also sprinkle out from the bottle's nozzle and run down your finger(s). I like the size and shape of it as I can store it in the laundry room and not have to worry about it taking up too much space. The color of the bottle is nice also."

I have been using other brands of hair fibers and powders for the scalp (Caboki, Infinity, Joan Rivers, thinning hair powder kit, DERM match,  TRUHAIR thickening fibers,) THIS one is  by far the best one I've used! Easy to put on and it does look very natural! I have been spending so much time on my hair with other products to make it look natural, that this one has cut my time in the morning. The color matches perfectly and it doesn't irritate my scalp, nor make it itchy. I work in an office and those florescent lights are horrible. Some of the powders were showing green tinged under those lights! I was horrified. I will never buy anything else, as long as they don't change the formula. ONE satisfied customer!!!!

I am having to shake it on, which is very messy and I think uses far more product than necessary. I am really disappointed that the atomizer does not work. I have used Coboki and decided to try this product just because of the atomizer so, the fact that it does not work is a disappointment as I paid far more for this product than I do Coboki. The reason I went with this product and atomizer rather than Coboki is that this product's atomizer is reuseable and the Coboki one gets thrown away with the empty container. I have an issue with that as it is very wasteful. Anyway, as far as the product is concerned, I would say they are equivalent. Just really wanted to be able to use an atomizer for even distribution"

It contains both avobenzone and octinoxate, chemicals that raise flags according to the EWG website, and which I blame for the stinging sensation it caused for the first 15 minutes of having it on my skin. Second, it feels like slime and doesn't absorb – I had to spread it around for a good while before it lost that slimy feeling, and even then it still felt really sticky. Third, it smells like red jello...some people may like that, actually. And finally, I used it on a beach trip and even though I applied quite a bit, my face started to show signs of sunburn within 30 minutes of being outside. Maybe because it doesn't absorb? Or perhaps because it contains chemical sunscreens that break down in the sun? Who knows, but it's a terrible product and I won't be using the rest of it."

All of the stones have been interchangeable, this is nice so I can change the look in my ear without having to remove the post. The different lengths are great for different piercings in different places in the ear but also for different stages of healing. (I dont change them until the predetermined healing time is over, but even then the area can be a bit thicker for months or a year) I love the earrings and have had no problems with them, I will be buying more.

This one is the first that did not say it was for sensitive skin, but also has no added fragrance.  There is a light scent due to the regular ingredients.<br /><br />I like that this mask helps replenish the skin’s normal pH level and has good, quality ingredients for moisturizing the skin.  Comes with 10 sheet masks you wear for 15-20 minutes and is similar to other Korean sheet masks.  What I don’t like is that the mask is extra wide and covers a lot of my hair area.  It also bags more than other masks around the nose area, so I have to keep pushing it down.  Overall, it is a gentle mask that provides good moisture to the skin in the specified time."

While I did not notice anything special about these ones while using them, I can still think they are a great option because: 1) They are affordable ($2 per mask) and 2) Ingredients are all safe and clean (more details below).<br /><br />I have used them at night, right before bed, usually leave them on for 15 minutes. Once I removed them, my skin feels fresh. The following morning, I feel my face moisturized and soft. There is enough serum to apply on the neck and chest area. There is no need to rinse after using them. Great option to use after a facial. It covers pretty well all face. I had to fold the nose area because of a recent nose ring, but it does cover the nose as well.<br /><br />Regarding the ingredients, I use skincare ingredient analyzers that follow the EWG, which individually rates ingredients from 1 to 10 (lowest to highest hazard). I was impressed to see all ingredients are rated EWG1. Another interesting fact around ingredients is that there are no parabens, sulfates, silicones, alcohols, allergens and fragrances (a very common ingredient that is highly hazard).<br /><br />Expiration date: 2025 (3 years after received)"

Harmony (1) will relieve a multitude of irritations caused by many different issues. One of the main irritations are pads or tampons. Every month, especially for a heavy period, menstrual pads can cause painful irritations, dryness, rashes, pain and itching. Then when you are into menopause, the irritations, dryness, rashes, pain and itching are a hundred times worse, due to heavy periods that can last forever.<br /><br />There are many other issues that can cause constant irritations besides pads and tampons- if you’ve ever had a bad Urinary Tract Infection, where you are urinating frequently in pain, the rashes are unbearable. Having a weak bladder at times where you need a heavier pad or diaper causes more unpleasant rashes. It is so difficult to find a cream that will actually help with severe chafing, dryness, pain, itching and irritations. This V. Harmony Vaginal Moisturizer helps immensely with chafing and dryness. But when it comes to helping with severe rashes, itching and pain- make sure you refrigerate this first before applying, because you will be happy you did. Applying this cold is the best relief ever- the pain goes away immediately. Take the time to refrigerate the jar for maximum, instant relief! 5 STARS."

It is, however, a nice collection of organic oils and beeswax which combines to make a semisolid much lighter in feel than petroleum jelly but not a liquid.  You need only a little dab - using too much could get messy.  It softens at body temperature but doesn't turn into an oily liquid.  It is quite nice and refreshing.  It's an odd greenish color.<br /><br />But the product is a bit confusing to me.  It is for external vaginal use only.  I don't know about you, but at what point is my vagina external instead of internal?  It seems pretty internal to me.  That makes it of limited use to postmenopausal women like me.  Soothing and comforting, yes, but not really what most postmenopausal women need."

This is not for \"lubrication\" inside, but for surface treatment of dryness, itching, or irritation. I don't really have those problems, but do experience the normal most-menopausal issues of many women, which this IS NOT really designed to treat. I used prescription creams for that in the past, but worry about continued hormone use.<br /><br />This is kind of heavy and pasty in the jar but does seem to dissolve on warm skin. I used it very sparingly and had no problems with residue on my underwear and it was soothing. I would be cautious of staining due to the Sea Buckthorn Oil, which is orange naturally.<br /><br />Instructions recommend refrigeration for extra comfort to irritated skin, but it's not necessary for preservation. What is a concern of mine is contamination if using your fingers to get it out of the jar.  It would be best to have a washable or disposable applicator/spatula to prevent this.<br /><br />My limited experience with this has been positive. If used correctly, I feel that it is effective to sooth the fragile skin in your most private of areas."

These lashes are perfectly dramatic enough, and suffice well as a replacement.<br /><br />I was worried that the length of the lashband wouldnt be long enough to to suit my eyelid, but I was pleasantly surprised when they fit pretty well!! Perfect for a full lash look.<br /><br />The only fault to them is perhaps how thick the lashband is, and we cant trim it thinner because then the lashes would start to shed profusely. Also, because of the Band being so thick, it is not too flexible. If the Band were a bit more flexible, then it would be easier for them to stay in the Positions that I glue them down to.<br /><br />All in all, id 100% buy them again, they are better than a few expensive lashes ive bought that come im smaller amounts."

The first thing I noticed when I took it out of the package was the multiple power ports on the back of the unit. It comes with a cable already to plug into any outlet but I guess if you wanted to use your own cord you could. I ended up plugging my nail drill/file into the back of the unit so I didn't have multiple things to plug into separate outlets. The lights go around the entire inside of the dome so you don't have to worry about your hand being flat. It has 3 different settings on the top for 30/60/90 seconds. I just watched the timer on the top of the unit that counts up every time you put your hand or foot in. I like that the entire unit is plastic and not metal. The light also shuts off when you remove your hand. Very nice and look forward to doing my nails again!"

Natural nails don't survive that kind of abuse, so builder gel and fiberglass nail wrap on my picking hand are a fact of life when I'm playing a lot.<br />This is a good curing lamp.  It will do the gel by itself in 60-180 seconds, depending on thickness, and a little longer when fiberglass is involved.<br />It has buttons for 10, 30, and 60 seconds.  A fourth button puts the lamp in half power mode if the curing gel is heating up too much for you.<br />It's big enough to get one of my large hands in.  If you have smaller hands you might be able to get both in at the same time.<br />The bottom detaches from the top very easily, making it easy to clean the inside.<br />A wall wart power supply is included.  No need to dig out an old phone charger.<br />My only gripe is the power claim.  It says 72 watts. According to my watt meter, it's 23 watts on high, and 12 watts on low.  That's plenty of power for an LED lamp, I just wish they'd be honest about it.<br />Bottom line, this is a good curing lamp that does the job."

I have chewed on raw garlic root many times in the past. I have burnt my mouth from it and I love doing that.<br /><br />When I drove for 1000 miles once, I started getting whoozy from motion sickness.Ginger cured the dizzy or lightheaded feeling. I know that ginger will fix vertigo and faintness issues too. I have treated myself many times in the past.<br /><br />Ginger is also know to settle the stomach. Usually, when I consume sugar, my appetite gets thrown into overdrive a little bit more than normal. Sugar tends to upset my tummy and cause me to eat more to relieve it. But I think the ginger extract may help settle my stomach here, because my stomach feels fine an hour after eating candy.<br /><br />So, this product is more designed for kids because it is sweeter than it is hot. It's not for me. Thank you"

She hates to sit still for a blow dryer and her hair is a mess when she lets it dry on the pillow at night. Takes 5 minutes to smooth it before the bus picks her up for school. It's been a lifesaver for her.<br />However, I would not use this  as a replacement for a flatiron or blowdryer. You can't possibly hold the hair taught enough to get it completely smooth on the ends. So while I use it to smooth my roots and above my ends, I hit my ends with a flat iron to get them smooth. The photos attached show what my ends look like with just this product and the second photo is the smoothness I get when hitting it with a flatiron right after.<br />Overall I am pleased with this product.

I ordered this with some trepidation and scepticism because my hair does not hold a blowout or straightening by ceramic flat iron or basically anything else with or without product.  My hair is coarse (it needs 40 volume to dye my hair and has since I started as a teenager).  It is thick and frizzy and about 5&#34; below my shoulders.  THIS PRODUCT ACTUALLY WORKS!!!!!  At first I figured that my hair would revert back after a couple of hours. It Did Not!  My hair stayed straight until my next shampoo about 4 days later with No Touchups.  I have always refused to even try to style my hair because it would take hours with every and any product or tool out there.  I am Soooo happy.  I tell all of my friends about the Eqoba Hair Straightener Because It Delivers On What It Promises.  Now after my hair dries I take no more than 10 minutes and no product to run this brush through my hair and it is fully and completely straightened from my scalp to the ends.  No split ends, ZERO DAMAGE.  I use this brush on the hottest setting of 450 degrees-again, no damage.  Not only does the Eqoba Hair Straightener straighten my hair, but keeps it straight even after 4 days, sleeping, no bed head, nothing!  And my hair is easy to comb the next day.  I AM ELATED!!  If you have any doubts-erase them now. and buy Eqoba now.  My hair is the absolute worst to deal with and now it is totally easy."

I have brought lots of hair from Amazon and NEVER once written a review which goes to show you had bad this hair is. Do not waste your money on this hair, you are better off spending a little more and walking in to a hair place where you can take a look at the hair, feel it and make sure you aren't stressed everyday like me. My beautician did a great job on the install but the constant shedding, tangling and knots have been the most stressful experience. Now I have to purchase more hair, and spend more money for a re-install SMH!! Its unfortunate, because the hair is beautiful. #STRESSED!!! Update: The seller contacted me and has been texting my Google Voice number for the past few days. The seller asked me to change my review to 5 stars and then they would compensate me for the hair. DO NOT TRUST THIS SELLER. They are aggressive with trying to get you to change the review to 5 stars. I just saw someone else submitted a review which confirms what I am telling you. Please be careful, not sure if they randomly ship hair that is not human and wait to see if anyone notices......This is an honest review, I sent the seller pics of my knotted and shedding hair, and they basically tried to get me to change my review for more hair SMH! Don't let the constant My Dears fool you."

I loved that it has a dropper attached to the bottle top which helps keep waste down! I'm usually awful about wasting product but the dropper allowed me to get what I need. For the selling price point, this is comparable to some of the more expensive products I've tried in the past. I have bad skin, acne prone with a whole heck of a lot of sun damage so I'm always looking for something that works and isn't going to cost an arm and a leg. After about 2 weeks worth of usage I noticed a difference in my skin; it was smoother and some of my lighter laugh lines were not as apparent. After about a month, I saw a difference in my deeper set wrinkles [forehead and under my chin] I plan to keep using this product in the future. The first week or so was a little tough, as my skin reacts poorly to new skin care regimens...I saw an increase in my oil secretion, but this is a typical reaction for me. After that first week my skin adjusted. I really enjoy using this serum, I love that it doesn't go on greasy and it dries very fast and does not react with my foundation so I can wear it under my daily make up with no issue. I'm glad that I was able to try this product for free in exchange for my honest review of it.<br /><br />I would definitely purchase this product."

My hands are often dry, and the nice thing is they are pretty identical, so in this time, I applied the serum to only one hand.<br /><br />I will say that the left hand which is the one I tested on, was softer and smoother than the right. However, as far as aging goes, I did not see a difference. My pores didn’t seem tighter, or my skin less wrinkly, and I did use it twice a day. I am 41, so I would think a target age for this, since I have little wrinkles, but not so many that my entire hand is covered in them.

I didn't have to use hair spray or hair setting spray to make the curl stay in place either. Best thing I think I have bought off of amazon in a long time!!!!"

It has a pretty light band around the bottom that offers changing colors with the option to choose one color at a time if you desire.

        "text": "APPLICATION &amp; USE<br />This ASNaturals Serum is a potent 20% Vitamin C paired with Hyaluronic Acid. It is suitable for daytime use under sunscreen and moisturizer.  It dries down quickly and without a sticky residue, so the skin looks dewy and moist when it is used without makeup, and when given adequate dry down time or when the serum is used sparingly, it does not conflict with makeup or make too sticky of a base to wear foundation. It has a light feeling; it does not sting, and it has a very light scent that dissipates when dry.<br /><br />INGREDIENTS<br />There are many vitamin C serums on the market, so when selecting a Vitamin C serum, I like to see what complimentary ingredients are used to enhance the power of the Vitamin C.  The ASNaturals Serum has Hyaluronic Acid, Jojoba Oil, Aloe Vera and Witch Hazel.  These ingredients all work in tandem with the Vitamin C to boost its' anti-aging properties.<br /><br />Hyaluronic Acid is a super-moisturizer, it holds massive amounts of water compared to its weight and makes skin looks dewy, soft and plump. The high moisture content in the skin plumps wrinkles, so they seem softer, smoother, and less deep.  In addition to giving a youthful appearance, the Hyaluronic Acid helps active ingredients sink deeper into the skin, which means the Vitamin C can make collagen on a deeper skin level, reaching deep wrinkles, age spots, redness, and discoloration.<br /><br />Jojoba Oil and Aloe Vera both moisturize and heal skin. These ingredients give the skin a smooth and soft appearance while the Vitamin C goes to work on acne and dark brown spots and acne scars, healing and lightening the blemishes.<br /><br />RESULTS:<br />Since this is a gentle Vitamin C Serum due to its' supporting ingredients, I can use this on more delicate skin areas such as my throat, decolletage, and shoulder blades, as well as the delicate undereye area. My skin has a subtle glow, and my skin tone is becoming evener. I am especially happy with the improvement in the look of some sun damage on my collarbone and upper chest area.<br /><br />CONCLUSION: This is a great price for a 20% Vitamin C serum. It is suitable for Sensitive and dry skin for treating acne, brown spots, sun damage, scarring, and wrinkles.<br /><br />I received this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. If you have any questions about my experience with it, leave it in the comments section below, and I’ll do my best to answer it!"

There are quite a few things to consider before buying though. For one, the case is way too big. I think you could fit two batteries in it, which I guess if you owned two, that would be great! But, for extra cords, etc. you definitely do not need a huge amount of space. With it being big, it is awkward to put into bags, etc. Another minor annoyance is the loop strap. It may be a personal preference but it is in an awkward location and almost gets in the way when zipping up your case. I wish it was removable.<br /><br />So, if you're looking to more protection for your battery for cheap, look no further. This case will definitely protect your battery; just consider the above things before buying."

I feel a cool sensation when apply it then the product get absorbed by the skin and you don’t feel it at all( no sticky residue). My eyebrows are filling up lightly since I use more on them. Eyelashes are more noticeable and smooth ....it’s been only two weeks so I will update in couple of weeks.

I was able to bend it back but it seems like those spots are particularly weak now and could easily be snapped off. I would recommend buying things like this from other parties who package the product correctly, otherwise you may end up with something as pictured or worse.

It has fine detail around the headband of the tiara. Each delicate flower is antique looking. The metal is darkened in areas. The gemstones in the leaves are a light pink/purple color. The other gemstones are other various shades of purple. There’s a deep purple that is almost red and a purple that’s in the middle of the light and dark. The tiara is substantial. It’s not sharp despite looking like it has many sharp pieces to it. I will say a few of the rhinestones that set up on top of the metal decoration were bent. I was able to bend them back ever so slightly. Of course I worry too much bending may break the tiara.<br /><br />It fits well on the head and it is quite comfortable. It’s a attractive tiara and definitely one that’s more for an adult or teen head. I wouldn’t consider something like this for a child. It’s definitely larger for a larger head."

This is not a full circle crown which makes it easier to fit on the head and keep in place. There are holes on each end to fix the crown in place.

My first use started out ok, then I started to get random hair pulling.  I gutted it out and finished shaving my entire face.  I thought that they may need a 'break in' period, so I decided to give them a second try.  The second try was just as bad as the first, but again, I gutted it out.  I decided to give them a third try, but was so stressed just waiting for the unknown hair pull, I gave up.  After the third failed attempt I decided to find new blades.<br /><br />Lucky for me, I did find replacement blades from Phillips/Norelco from Target for around $35.

It may be small but it works wonders on our family's hair.  It works through tangles without pulling or causing pain while leaving hair soft, shiny and manageable.  The compact size makes it perfect for travel, to keep in a purse, a school/gym locker, briefcase or even a pocket.  If you've never experienced a boar bristle brush, I HIGHLY recommend giving it a try. You can't be the price and the results will be worth it!  If, for some reason you're not satisfied, GAINWELL asks you to contact them for assistance. I can't imagine they receive a ton of calls with issues but its great to know customer service is a  priority!"

        "text": "This brush has been great for me and my toddler son due to its reasonable size and quality build. The wooden handle is ergonomic, and the longer bristles coupled with boars bristles make fast work of unruly hair. Both my toddler and I have wavy, relatively thick hair, and we're able to get it under control with this brush. It's priced right (under $10 when I got it), and the quality really seems higher than expected for that price range. Just be aware, when they say small, they mean small. My wife's standard sized hair brush is considerably larger. If you need something bigger, this may not be the best option, but if you have fairly short hair and are okay with a smaller brush, this one is great.<br /><br />***I write reviews as a hobby because I love trying out electronics, clothing, household products, kitchen devices, and more. My hope is that my review will guide you to make a more informed choice about whether or not to make a purchase. If this review helped you in your decision-making today, please let me know with a helpful vote. Have a great day!***"

However, It detangles and brushes through my curls with ease. I also did not experience the typical loss of bristles I usually do with a boar bristle brush. Most animal hair brushes seem to shed for a while and then stop shedding. So far I have not had that problem.<br /><br />I actually cannot believe this is priced at $7.29 because most boar bristles brushes of this size are in the $28 to $30 range. The price, coupled with the style, finish, and functionality of this hairbrush is outstanding in my opinion."

Therefore, I have searched and searched for products everywhere that would help thicken my hair back up to where it used to be, really thick and curly, like crazy thick!!  Now, it's so thin and flat and drab.  I hate it so much and it depresses me even.  Until, I found Elizabeth Parker Naturals Deep Conditioning Treatment &amp; Hair Thickener.  OMG!  This stuff works like magic!!  I swear!  If only they made it in a gallon, it would last me a lifetime since you only need a dab each time you use it!  I really, wholeheartedly recommend this treatment regardless of what a few others have said in these reviews.  It reversed the side effects of all those meds I'm on and I'm back to being my happy self again!  Don't let the size fool you.  You need this if you are experiencing the same thing I did!"

I honestly wasn’t sure what to expect, but it came with 6 packs, I only used 3 for my whole head and I did them small, so definitely worth it, the hair is soooo light it honestly feels like there’s nothing in your hear, you can throw it up in a bun, ponytail, anything and won’t feel it pulling or tugging, I really like the hair, it’s super soft as well, I recommend separating the curls for the strands of hair if you want a fuller chunkier twist, if you just separate the two main strands and retwist it with your hair the twist will keep that spiral curl, and it won’t be as full, if that’s what you want go for it but if not I highly recommend just loosening them up with your fingers, it’s super easy since the hair is so soft, but still be careful so you don’t get tangles, the hair also came with a pack of 5 colorful metallic braid cuffs, and a crotchet needle, you can crotchet or just put them in like any other braiding hair, also I’m about 5’3 and the length was PERFECT!! It came down to my hips and tailbone, so if you want something to be around that length the 24 inches is perfect, and if you want something longer you have enough hair to add on for length. I’m just in awe with this product just for how light and quick it was to do, I don’t think I’ll ever do traditional box braids again! Also straight out the pack it kinda has a weird odor, nothing repulsive just a little weird, but once you run your fingers through them and attach it to your hair the scent goes away! I’m not even being paid for this or anything i just really like this hair, and none of the beauty supply stores near me sell passion twist hair so this was my last option and it did not disappoint!"

        "text": "I bought this trimmer two months ago.  I use it to keep my hair very short.  I have not gone to a barber ever since I bought this.  I simply turn the dial to set the guard to level 5 and cut all of my hair the same lenght.  Definitely easy to use.  On my short hair, I can probably get four complete haircuts in one charge.  This is a good trimmer for those men who like to keep their hair very short all the way around.  Use it two times and it would have paid for itself due to the fact that you were able to avoid going to a barber.<br />This is my second Norelco trimmer.  My first one was a T6000 that I bought back in February of 2001.  The battery stopped taking a charge four months ago, after almost 3 years of use.  I called Norelco to have the battery replaced, and I was then informed that they do not replace the batteries on these trimmers since replacing the battery would cost as much as buying a newer unit.  So, I ordered the newer T860 from Amazon.  The T860 functions just like the older T6000.  In addition, the T860 can also function as a corded trimmer, in the event the battery stops taking a charge.  The service life of the trimmer can extend beyond the life of the rechargeable battery by using the cord.  I am satisfied with it.<br />By the way, the reason why the battery got damaged in my older T6000 was that I kept the unit plugged in the charger stand for very long periods of time.  I later learned not to do that, as that practice will damage the battery over time.  Overcharging even a little seems to damage the battery over time.  It's best to read the directions so you will know how to properly care for the battery.  The battery basically will determine the life of the unit.  The cutters do not wear out, from what I can tell.  The motor seems durable.  So the life of the unit is really how long you can keep the internal rechargeable battery working.  Norelco's internal rechargeable Ni-Cad batteries can last a long time, if given proper care.  They seem to be of good quality.<br />I had a Norelco 885 razor, and the battery was still taking a charge after nine years.  The razor had the advantage of having a five level battery meter that tells you how much charge is left in the internal batteries.  Basically, you want to wait until there is only a little charge left before you put the unit in the charger.  It seems this trimmer is a bit different though.  The instructions on the T860 unit say to completely drain the battery.  Which would be a bit inconvenient.  With the T860 trimmer, it takes 10 hours for a full charge.  Recharge fully.  That way,  you can minimize the dreaded \"memory effect\" or voltage depression and extend the useful life of the rechargeable batteries.  The rechargeable batteries are permanently soldered inside the unit.  This trimmer unit, T860, does not have a charge meter.  I refrained from getting the pricier unit with a charge meter in order to economize.  However, my advice to you, if you're not too cost-sensitive, is to get a unit with a charge meter.  That way, you will know when to charge the unit and when to remove the unit from the charger.  That precise practice should help extend the life of the battery, and hence, the unit."

No battery indicator - I just give it a swift re-charge about one a month. Beware of changing settings and forgetting to reselect the most appropriate for the target area.....!"

I've had it now for 1.5 years and it's enabled me to keep the exact look I want all the time. It's already saved me money from getting haircuts and since it only takes me me 15-25 minutes to do my head and beard I save a lot of time too. I like the multiple settings....the choices for length are very satisfactory.  My only complaint is that Norelco claims the blades are self sharpening but I've noticed that the trimmer has gotten less efficient over time and that it now takes longer to trim my hair and beard.  Having said that, my needs are fairly unique and this product meets those needs very well."

        "text": "Wow! I should have bought one of these long ago! It's totally worth every penny after you use it a few times. There is NO need to get the next model up if all you want is a good shave. The next model up (the T990 I believe) charges in 1 hour vs. 10 hours for this model, and it has an LCD screen to show battery life. For as often as you'll use this trimmer, plugging it in overnight while you're sleeping is not that big a deal. This model doesn't have an LCD screen to tell you battery life, but do you really wanna pay more than double just for a quicker charge and a display of battery life? Not me!<br />The guard on the trimmer is smooth and glides easily over your skin. The T860 trims effortlessly - never snagging, pulling, or getting clogged with your hair. Battery life stays consistent until the last minute before it's completely drained. To eliminate hair's static attration to the rubber dial used to change cutting length, spray it with a quick spritz of Static Guard. Otherwise, just rinse it off when you're done; the hair rinses off easily with water.<br />This trimmer is made to trim facial hair, but it works GREAT on the legs, chest, stomach, and any other areas you'd imagine shaving! The 9 different settings insure that you keep the hair on, but under control...nice and tidy appearence. We all know how hairy we guys can get! I like to use a #3 on my legs, but you'd want to start out with a 6, then go DOWN ONE LEVEL AT A TIME to ensure that you don't cut TOO MUCH OFF.<br />DO NOT USE THE GUARDLESS TRIMMER WITHOUT READING THE DIRECTIONS! I nipped my skin (drawing a little blood) several times. Read directions and see illustrations for proper use without the guard. In any case, I do not recommend using it guardless in sensitive areas as it can be painful.<br />Anyway, if you're wondering whether you should buy this trimmer, DO. You will NOT regret the INVESTMENT! It saves so much time!"

        "text": "... there's a few things that Norelco needs to change. First, the zoom ring, because it's made of rubber, tends to attract hair like a magnet attracts metal. Cleaning hair off of there is a MAJOR pain!! It'd be a hell of a lot easier to clean if it was made of plastic. Secondly, the cleaning brush they include is too small, and its design ain't that ergonomic. And why does it take 10 hours to charge up? Of course, I guess the average person doesn't use a trimmer that often, so I'm thinking that won't be a big deal. Overall, though, this product works as advertised. If you just want to \"get the job done\", and could care less about all that fancy, high tech stuff, then you'll get your money's worth with this trimmer."

This trimmer delivers a precise, consistent shave every time.  It is easy to use and the controls have a solid feel to them giving you complete control over your beard and moustache.  I also like that Norelco gives you the option of corded or cordless shaving with the 860T.  This is as good as it gets."

For everything else I have my lacefronts etc. ITS NOT A LACE FRONT WIG. I wore it straight out of the box.<br /><br />It has adjusted head size hooks on the inside like most every wig. The hair is soft and vibrant color. If you’re brown skin than you’ll have to apply foundation to the mid split because it’s pale. I won’t be because it’s worn under a cute and styled durable or scarf when I’m at work!

Like any tube glue, it's hard to get it to come out exactly the way you want it, gets goopy around the lid, etc. I got the black glue because I thought it would work well to cover up the lash line and fill in eyeliner. In fact, it works very well for that purpose, but unfortunately, if you barely touch the lash line to any part of your eyelid, or it slides a bit, you have a line of sticky black tar where it touched. Whatever, it's fine. Eyelash glue is always a PITA. I'll probably get clear next time, but otherwise there's no major complaints here."

However, I ordered three cans, but received three cans of a different scent. I don’t know if this was a substitute because the mineral sage is out of stock, but I did not get a call asking to substitute. Also, one can was half empty! so the products by dove are very very good. I have all of them. I have a soap, spray and many other shaving products. However, this seller sent the wrong product and it was half empty. Caveat emptor with this seller.  I cannot tell if the cans are reused or new."

When the deodorant is sprays it’s painful. Not sure why, could be because the spray is too strong or that the formal isn’t being dispersed properly but it feels a little like mini deodorants balls being shot at your armpit when you spray. I tried to look up the issue on the web but no luck (it’s not causing skin irritation after application, just pain during application). The pain is not enough to stop me from using the product but I probably will buy the product directly from the store moving forward."

It has definitely calmed down my acne (which is bull that I am still having to deal with it in my late 30's &#62;:/ ) but I also have overly sensitive skin and I had not had a reaction to this at all. Even though it has bits in it to exfoliate they do not irrate my skin and it does not leaving my skin feeling dried out nor does it leave a nasty coating on my skin either.<br /><br />I use this soap as my go to nightly cleaner to get all the dirt and grime off my face. I soap it up in my hands and lather it on as I feel the exfoliate bits in it would be too harsh for every day cleaning (especially with my already sensitive skin) so I only use the bar directly on my face once a week for a good deep down clean.<br /><br />I also cut down the bar, a nice palm sized section for my nightly face cleanse and then rest stays in my shower. I do recommend that you keep the bar on a breathable soap dish (I use those seafoam kinda looking, all natural ones) whether you have it by the sink or in the shower as it will help the bar stay nice and clean and dry out quicker so it keeps longer. Definitely do not keep in under the shower head as the dripping water will only errode the bar that much quicker.<br /><br />If you keep the bar dry when not in use it will last you for quite a while so it helps with the expense.<br /><br />I am really happy with this soap as I said, I have seen a good difference in my acne and I now do not break out as much. It also just give you a good clean feeling with no residue and the lemon honeysuckle scent is very pleasing and not over powering at all."

It came in a plain white flat box filled with 300 of these (I haven’t actually counted each one so I don’t know if there are actually 300 of them) I googled on how to apply these stickers which wasn’t that hard to follow.<br />Cons: they do not seem to stick well.<br />They aren’t invisible to the eye so you can definitely see you have tape on the side of your face or where ever you decide to put it on.<br />They also make your skin itch. Maybe I recently developed sensitive skin. Who knows. But that’s not a good sign when your skin turns red and feels like it’s burning & itching simultaneously.<br />Pros: they are stretchy<br />The end.<br />So, to sum up my review, they don’t really work. Well for me that is. Instead of returning it, I decided to just keep it to perhaps use it for something else"

It does a great job at sealing the hair to protect it during thermal styling. However, it weighs heavily on the hair afterwards. Even when using very little of the product it's still too heavy in my opinion. The main ingredient is Shea butter and this in my opinion does not belong in the hair at all.  Shea butter should be used on the skin/body. shea butter is not similar to oils such as argan etc."

Fresh Balls is a lotion that turns into a freshness product, well… let me let them explain it.<br /><br />PROBLEM:<br />99.9 % OF ALL MEN SUFFER FROM THE PROBLEM OF SWEATY BALLS.<br /><br />SOLUTION:<br />FreshBalls was created to take care of the problems the other companies forgot about. Here at freshballs we take pride in using natural products that not only solve the problem, but they are good for the skin.<br /><br />So there in a nutshell you have the problem and solution. Does it work? Should you get some? YES!<br /><br />I immediately ordered Fresh Balls from Amazon.com (it is Prime Eligible BTW) and two days later I was in business.<br /><br />True to their claim it keeps things fresh. The lotion has a pleasant smell (not girly) and feels soft. Once the lotion drys, things stay fresh. Real fresh. Depending on what you do during your day you may need to freshen up, but Fresh Balls certainly makes a difference.<br /><br />Go get some Fresh Balls today!"

This stuff works SO incredibly well, and each bottle lasts a little longer than a month.<br /><br />The product goes on like a lotion, and when it dries it works like powder, except you don't have the mess that powder leaves. I've been using powder for MANY years, my wife even giving me a \"powder puff\" to apply the powder under scrotum, etc. Obviously, the powder goes into the air and lands everywhere.<br /><br />With Fresh Balls, I dry the area very well, to start, often even using a hair blow dryer. I take about a dime size amount and rub it on the left side of my scrotum. Rub another dime size on the left side. Rub a nickel size amount underneath, and a little on the \"top\" where my penis might hang. I don't want to put any directly on the shaft in case my wife and I get intimate later that day and it happens to go in her mouth. Finally, I put some underneath my scrotum, at the top and between my legs, where they touch together. Basically, any where I feel that sweaty feeling throughout the day. I get dressed immediately after application. The lotion dries in a few minutes (yes, at first it was uncomfortable with wetness where I wanted it dry, but as I said, it dries quickly). I am sweat free ALL DAY LONG. This stuff is amazing!<br /><br />No powder mess. No need for re-application. Best of all: it works!"

First of all, this thing is much larger than any other slicker style brush I have. This is a great feature for my large dog, but it was just ridiculous trying to groom my cats with this large, unyielding wire brush. So, not a good choice for the cats.<br /><br />Unfortunately, not a good choice for my dog either, as she has a short coat with little to no undercoat and she was really uncomfortable with wires dragging on her skin. She's more of a rubber curry comb type gal, I guess. Besides the size and wire bristle problems, the plastic itself felt a little brittle and cheap and when you add in the mechanics of retractable bristles... I think higher quality material would have been a better choice because that slider for the bristles is very basic. Finally, while I loved the idea of the easy-to-clean retractable bristles, they really aren't necessary and if those wires become crooked or bent it will cause all kinds of problems with the retraction. I've made it decades by just pulling the fur out of my slicker brushes-- it literally takes 2-3 seconds-- and while the thought of retractable bristles is nice, it totally isn't necessary. It's not a practical tool for me and doesn't work for any of my animals due to its size and the wire bristles. It also doesn't seem terribly well-made nor is it made of high-quality materials, and for the price it should be."

Poor little thing is only 4.5 pounds and she's fairly old and toothless so it's not like she'd turn and bite anyone trying to keep her looking like the pretty little girl she is.  I got this brush for her fine, curly hair.  She is a sweet little girl, but will \"bleat\" if she thinks you intend to hurt her and the first time I put a brush to her, she was shivering like I was going to do something bad to her.  I talked to her and took my time and by the time I was done, she was relaxed and let me work on her a little at a time.  My other furgirl is an older, rescued papillion and because her fur is straight with no undercoat, this brush works great on her.  She doesn't mind the brush at all and I think she likes how it lightly \"scratches\" her skin at the same time. Great brush for my two old girls!"

The retractable pins solve the problem!  This brush is even easy to use with arthritic hands!<br /><br />My Siamese cat with short, thick fur, adores this brush!

I love that when people see me with these lashes it takes them a second to notice how long they are instead.

This seems like a reasonable compromise. The mesh bags hold the soap and allow you to use all of it, down to the very last tiny piece. They foam up nice and the mesh bag provides a bit of scrubbing like I'd get from a standard shower puff. It's a bit tricky to use when switching from hand to hand as you have to try and keep the drawstring closed so the soap doesn't fall out but the drawstring is what allows you to hang the bag after your shower, which keeps it from getting sticky and covered in slime. That's the reason I went with mesh instead of a natural, woven material as a lot of the comments were that the bags disintegrated quickly and got sticky and gummy because they couldn't dry properly between uses.<br /><br />These seem sturdy enough like they'll last through several bars of soap. And the pack of 20 means I'll have enough for me (a single person) to last for awhile.<br /><br />The reason I deducted a star is the excessive packaging. The irony for me is that I got these to get away from buying plastic bottles (that can be recycled). These came individually wrapped, wrapped together in another bag, inside a bigger bag - none of which can be recycled. Seems a bit excessive for mesh bags."

Let's not talk about the precision of my job or lack thereof - I gave up on that once I saw how the color was going down.<br /><br />I wanted a hot pink glassy nail polish - the way it appears on the stem of the nail brush. Instead, the pink went down more like Hi-C pink lemonade. The photos of my hand are 3 or 4 coats - I don't remember which. It's just not the color I wanted it to be.<br /><br />I tried the red on my right hand (not pictured) and instead of a nice true cherry red (like in the product pic) it's more like an orangey red that reminds me of fake vampire blood from a halloween store. Maybe I'll use it around halloween.<br /><br />To their credit: these polishes are not streaky and went on nicely.<br /><br />So for now, I'm giving these 2 stars for not matching product pics. Will try the orange, green, blue, and black, and then maybe update my review if those look nice."

I organized these based on light medium and deep then put a W on any that had a warm undertone.  I liked that there is so many shades in the Medium skin range.

I found them at several home type stores, but the cost was over a hundred for each one I found. I held off thinking eventually I will find one at a better price. I came across the Kenley Wall Mounted Magnifying Makeup Mirror on Amazon at half of what I had seen elsewhere.<br /><br />I had the opportunity to purchase the Kenley mirror at a promotional price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. I immediately<br />jumped at the chance.<br /><br />The mirror came a few days ago. I waited till today to install when my husband could help me. The mirror came with almost everything you need to install the mirror - including the screws and anchors. For tools, we used a level and a cordless screwdriver. The installation instructions were easy to understand and they included drawings. We were able to install the mount in about five minutes.<br /><br />The mirror itself is very nice and well made. One side is regular and the other is 3 times magnifying. It is a chrome silver. There is a LED ring in the inside and in between the mirrors. It requires 4 - AA batteries. You have to unscrew one side of the mirror to install the batteries. It is easy to unscrew and screw back on. You do want to make sure that the mirror is screwed back on tightly. The LED lights are turned on my a switch on the outside of the mirrors.<br /><br />The LED light is great, with the combination of the either mirror. Plucking my brows was easier than ever before on the magnifying side with the LED light turned on. The mirror both turns and flips. The bracket has an extending arm, so that you can manipulate the mirror to wherever you need it to be. It folds up nicely to be stored against the wall. The mirror is also the perfect size for a mounted mirror. In my picture below you can see the mirror is size relation to an outlet in my wall.<br /><br />This is exactly what I wanted, from the moment I saw a similar mirror at the Hotel Philips in KS City. I strongly recommend it!"

This double-sided 3x magnification mirror tilts and swivels so you can get the perfect angle for whatever you're doing. The extending arm goes from 7 to 24 inches with a gentle tug, so you can easily tuck this wall-mounted mirror away when it's not in use, and pull it out to where you need it.<br /><br />Up close and personal<br />With a diameter of 7&#34;, this Kenley Extending Mirror is large enough to be easy to use but small enough to be unobtrusive. An elegant chrome finish will make it a feature in any bathroom. The soft surround lighting provides glare-free illumination with the help of 12 LED bulbs. Long life technology means you should never need to change a bulb. Installation is simple as there are no wires involved. The lights run on 4 standard AAA batteries (not included)."

I like that this palette allows you to cold or warm tone.<br /><br />The eye shadows are highly pigmented and are beautiful brown shades. Even though they are highly pigmented they blend out easily, including the darkest brown in the palette. When I used the shimmers I was not able to apply them with just a brush, but when I used my fingers they applied easily with a huge payoff. They were beautiful shimmers. The one thing missing in this eye palette is a very light colored shimmer for highlighting your brow bone and your inner eye corner. Plus I also like using lighter colors for the eye lid so I wished the shimmers were a bit lighter, or at least had one lighter one in the mix.<br /><br />This is a beautiful set with very nice mattes and shimmers that blend nicely and give you gorgeous looks for any occasion."

However, my skin (which is normal) is allergic to a lot of cosmetics.  Olay's creams and serums plus Dermaglow's NuVectin have been the major part of my skin care routine. Unfortunately, Dermaglow discontinued NuVectin (which had a very high concentration of peptides).  Being very  disappointed, I thought I would try to find a replacement (hopefully).  And when I came across &#34;DNA Code-No...&#34; products I thought maybe my prayers were answered..lol... However, I was a bit skeptical about it having all the right ingredients... hmmm... I thought maybe just an &#34;angel dusting&#34;. However, I still wanted to give it a try... At the same time, I  also ordered the &#34;DNA Code-No...Solution&#34; one to add to my &#34;Olay Regenerist&#34;.<br /><br />Here is my standard skin care routine:  I start off with Olay's serum followed by &#34;DNA Code-No Needle Alternative-Argireline NeuroPeptides ...&#34; ... after about 10 mins, I apply the  mixture of  &#34; DNA Code-No...Solution  + Olay Regenerist&#34; for an added moisture (at least). This product is not oily at all .  So far no allergies.. It may be just my imagination but I think I notice some improvement of  my crow's feet  already.<br /><br />So, so far so good. I hope this product will deliver (like the discontinued NuVectin did for me many years) and I will keep ordering it on Amazon... I will try to update my review after about a  month of use."

I have tied electric rip and pull (that is what they feel like) to all sorts of blade razers. This is the best so far. I can shave with or against the grain with no issue.
