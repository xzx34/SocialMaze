The authors aim to characterize the depth-width trade-offs of ReLU networks for representing functions based on the presence of periodic points, which is a generalized notion of fixed points.\n\nThe paper builds upon the seminal work of Telgarsky, who highlighted the benefits of depth in DNNs by presenting a family of functions that can be computed by deep networks but not by shallow ones. However, Telgarsky's work did not provide insight into why these functions are difficult to represent. The authors of the current paper attempt to address this open question by leveraging Sharkovsky's Theorem, which is a fundamental result in dynamical systems that characterizes the existence of periodic points.\n\nThe key contribution of the paper is the establishment of a connection between the depth-width trade-offs of ReLU networks and the presence of periodic points in the functions being represented. The authors provide general lower bounds for the width needed to represent periodic functions as a function of the depth, which is based on an eigenvalue analysis of the dynamical systems associated with such functions.\n\nThe paper's strengths include:\n\n1. **Novel connection**: The paper establishes a novel connection between DNNs and dynamical systems, which is a significant contribution to the field.\n2. **Theoretical rigor**: The paper provides a theoretically rigorous analysis of the depth-width trade-offs of ReLU networks, which is based on a solid mathematical foundation.\n3. **Addressing an open question**: The paper addresses an open question posed by Telgarsky, which is a significant contribution to the field.\n\nHowever, the paper's weaknesses include:\n\n1. **Lack of empirical evaluation**: The paper does not provide empirical evidence to support the theoretical results, which may limit the paper's impact.\n2. **Limited scope**: The paper focuses on ReLU networks, which may not be representative of other types of neural networks.\n\nDespite these weaknesses, the paper's strengths outweigh its limitations.

This represents a significant departure from traditional singing voice synthesis tasks, which typically rely on musical scores and text lyrics as inputs. The exploration of three different schemes (free singer, accompanied singer, and solo singer) adds to the novelty, as it covers a range of scenarios that could be of interest to the music and audio processing communities.\n\n2. **Technical Soundness**: The approach outlined in the paper involves several technically challenging components, including source separation, transcription models for data preparation, adversarial networks (specifically, Generative Adversarial Networks or GANs) for audio generation, and customized metrics for evaluation. The use of GANs for generating singing voices without scores or lyrics is particularly noteworthy, as GANs have been shown to be effective in generating realistic audio samples in other contexts. However, the technical soundness also depends on the execution, which includes the design of the models, the quality of the training data, and the effectiveness of the customized metrics for evaluating the generated singing voices.\n\n3. **Potential Impact**: The potential impact of this work is significant. Singing voice generation without the need for scores or lyrics could open up new avenues for music creation, education, and entertainment.

The novelty of BM lies in its ability to expose the exponent bias as an additional field for optimization, allowing for training with fewer exponent bits. This approach is significant because it addresses a critical challenge in the field: the need for more efficient and less power-consuming methods for training DNNs without sacrificing accuracy.\n\n2. **Quality of Methodology**: The methodology involves designing and testing the BM format for training DNNs, specifically focusing on its application to ResNet trained on ImageNet. The comparison with standard floating-point representations (like FP8 and FP32) provides a baseline to evaluate the effectiveness of BM. The fact that 6-bit BM achieves almost no degradation in floating-point accuracy while offering substantial reductions in hardware size and energy consumption suggests a robust methodology. Furthermore, the 8-bit BM format matching floating-point accuracy with improved computational density and expected training times underscores the potential of this approach.\n\n3. **Impact of Results**: The results presented are impactful for several reasons. First, achieving similar or better accuracy with significantly reduced hardware requirements (4.1 times smaller and 2.3 times less energy consumption for 6-bit BM compared to FP8) is a substantial contribution. It implies that BM could enable more efficient training of DNNs on a variety of hardware platforms, including those with limited resources. Second, the potential for faster training times with the 8-bit BM format could accelerate research and development in the field, allowing for more rapid exploration of neural network architectures and applications.\n\n4. **Comparison to State-of-the-Art**: The paper demonstrates a clear advantage over existing formats like FP8 and FP32 in terms of hardware efficiency and energy consumption, without compromising on accuracy.

      "response": "The paper \"Understanding and Leveraging Overparameterization in Recursive Value Estimation\" presents a comprehensive analysis of the role of overparameterization in recursive value estimation, a crucial aspect of reinforcement learning (RL). The authors delve into the differences in convergence points between classical updates like temporal difference (TD) learning, fitted-value-iteration (FVI), and residual minimization (RM) when using overparameterized linear representations. They further provide a unified interpretation of these methods and develop new algorithmic tools to improve the stability and generalization performance of recursive value estimation with deep models.\n\nThe paper's contributions can be broken down into several key areas:\n1. **Theoretical Analysis**: The authors provide a detailed theoretical analysis of overparameterized linear value estimation methods, including TD, FVI, and RM. This analysis reveals that these methods converge to different fixed points, which is a significant insight into the behavior of these algorithms in the overparameterized regime.\n2. **Unified Interpretation**: By interpreting overparameterized linear value estimation as minimizing the Euclidean norm of the weights subject to alternative constraints, the authors offer a unified framework for understanding these methods. This framework is valuable for comparing and contrasting different approaches.\n3. **Modification of RM**: The paper shows that a simple modification of the backup targets in RM can make it converge to the same fixed points as FVI and TD, while ensuring stability. This is a practical contribution that can impact the design of more stable and effective RL algorithms.\n4. **Analysis of Generalization Error**: The authors provide bounds on the value prediction error for FVI and fixed point bounds for TD and RM, which is essential for understanding the generalization capabilities of these methods.\n5. **New Algorithmic Tools**: The development of regularizers that penalize out-of-span top-layer weights and co-linearity in top-layer features is a significant contribution. These regularizers can improve the stability of TD and FVI and enhance the performance of RM.\n\nThe empirical results demonstrating the effectiveness of these regularizers in improving stability and generalization performance are compelling. The fact that RM, with the proposed modifications, can match or sometimes surpass the performance of TD and FVI while ensuring stability is particularly noteworthy.\n\nGiven the depth of analysis, the significance of the findings, and the potential impact on the field of reinforcement learning, this paper meets the high standards expected of a top-tier conference.

This demonstrates a thorough understanding of the methodological challenges and a sound approach to addressing them.\n\n4. **Theoretical Guarantees**: The paper provides polynomial bounds on sample complexity and running time, which are crucial for establishing the efficiency of the proposed algorithm. These guarantees are in terms of natural parameters such as the approximation guarantee, discount factor, distribution mismatch, and the number of actions, without an explicit dependence on the number of states. This is a strong theoretical contribution, as it ensures the scalability of the algorithm to large MDPs.\n\n5. **Impact and Significance**: The potential impact of this work is significant, as it could enable more efficient reinforcement learning in complex, large-scale environments. By providing a method that can handle MDPs with a large number of states without compromising on computational efficiency or optimality guarantees, the authors' approach could open up new avenues for applying reinforcement learning in real-world problems.\n\n6. **Clarity and Presentation**: Although the abstract is somewhat dense and technical, it clearly communicates the problem addressed, the approach taken, and the main contributions of the paper.

By identifying SGDm under covariate shift as a parametric oscillator that can suffer from resonance, leading to divergence, the paper offers a novel perspective on the stability of SGDm. This contribution seems original and relevant, as it challenges the conventional understanding of SGDm's behavior under non-iid sampling conditions.\n\n2. **Technical Soundness**: The approach of approximating the learning system as a time-varying system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and leveraging existing theory to characterize the system's behavior as resonant or non-resonant modes appears technically sound. The use of theoretical analysis, limited to the linear setting with periodic covariate shift, provides a solid foundation for understanding the phenomenon of resonance in SGDm. Furthermore, the authors empirically validate their findings in more complex scenarios, including non-periodic covariate shift, nonlinear dynamics with neural networks, and other optimizers, which strengthens the paper's technical contributions.\n\n3. **Empirical Evaluation**: The paper not only provides theoretical insights into the resonance phenomenon in SGDm but also supports these insights with empirical evidence. The experiments, although not fully detailed in the abstract, seem to cover a range of scenarios, from linear to nonlinear settings, and across different optimizers. This comprehensive empirical evaluation is crucial for demonstrating the practical relevance and robustness of the theoretical findings.\n\n4. **Clarity and Presentation**: While the abstract is concise and effectively communicates the paper's main contribution, a full evaluation of the paper's clarity and presentation would require access to the complete manuscript. However, based on the abstract, the authors seem to clearly articulate the problem, their approach, and the significance of their findings.\n\n5. **Impact and Relevance**: The paper's focus on the stability of SGDm under covariate shift has significant implications for machine learning practitioners and theorists alike. Understanding the conditions under which SGDm can diverge is crucial for designing more robust optimization algorithms, especially in applications where data distribution shifts are common. Therefore, the paper's contributions are likely to be of interest to a broad audience within the machine learning community, contributing to its potential impact.\n\nConsidering these aspects, the paper appears to make a significant and original contribution to the understanding of SGDm's behavior under covariate shift, backed by both theoretical analysis and empirical evidence.

The proposed architecture, TimeVAE, aims to address the limitations of existing methods, particularly those based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), by offering interpretability, the ability to encode domain knowledge, and reduced training times.\n\nThe paper's contributions can be summarized as follows:\n1. **Novel Architecture**: The introduction of TimeVAE as a VAE-based method for multivariate time-series generation is a significant contribution. It offers an alternative to GAN-based approaches, which have been dominant in the field but come with their own set of challenges, such as training instability and lack of interpretability.\n2. **Interpretability and Domain Knowledge**: The ability of TimeVAE to incorporate domain-specific time patterns (like polynomial trends and seasonalities) and provide interpretable outputs is a substantial advantage. This feature can be particularly beneficial in applications where transparency of model outputs is crucial or where prior knowledge of time-series patterns needs to be integrated into the generative model.\n3. **Performance Evaluation**: The authors conduct a thorough evaluation of TimeVAE against state-of-the-art data generation methods across four multivariate datasets.

This approach seems novel, especially since it combines elements of cellular automata with variational principles to create a probabilistic generative model. The fact that it is loosely inspired by biological processes adds a unique perspective, potentially offering new insights into generative modeling.\n\n2. **Technical Soundness**: The abstract suggests that the VNCA is technically sound, as it is described as a \"proper probabilistic generative model.\" This implies that the authors have a solid theoretical foundation for their work. The evaluation according to \"best practices\" further supports the technical soundness, indicating that the authors are aware of and adhere to the standards of the field.\n\n3. **Quality of Evaluation**: The paper claims to evaluate the VNCA according to best practices, which is a positive aspect. However, the abstract also mentions that there is a \"significant gap to the current state-of-the-art in terms of generative modeling performance.\" This could be seen as a weakness, but it also shows honesty and awareness of the model's limitations. The evaluation of the model's ability to learn a self-organizing generative process and its robustness against perturbations adds depth to the analysis.\n\n4. **Impact and Contribution**: The potential impact of the VNCA seems significant, given its ability to generate a large variety of outputs with relatively few parameters and simple communication mechanisms. The self-organizing nature of the model and its inherent robustness are notable contributions, especially if these aspects can be generalized or applied to other domains.\n\n5. **Clarity and Presentation**: Although the abstract provides a good overview, the full paper would need to be carefully reviewed to ensure that the ideas are clearly presented, well-organized, and supported by sufficient evidence. The abstract itself is concise and effectively conveys the main points of the paper.\n\nConsidering these factors, the paper appears to offer a novel approach to generative modeling, with a sound technical basis and a thorough evaluation. While it may not surpass the current state-of-the-art in performance, its unique perspective, simplicity, and robustness could contribute meaningfully to the field. The fact that the authors acknowledge the performance gap and focus on other strengths (like self-organization and robustness) suggests a mature understanding of their work's place within the broader context of generative modeling.\n\nFinal Decision: Accept"

This approach seems sound and well-motivated by the observation that different adversarial training methods have distinct robustness for different sample instances. However, without access to the full paper, it's difficult to assess the methodology's rigor and whether it adequately addresses potential challenges or limitations.\n\n3. **Impact of Results**: The paper claims that CAT achieves new state-of-the-art robustness on CIFAR-10 under the Auto-Attack benchmark without using any additional data. This is a significant result, indicating that the proposed method can outperform existing methods in terms of robustness, which is a critical aspect of model reliability and security. The fact that it also improves accuracy is a bonus, as many robustness-enhancing methods come at the cost of decreased performance on clean data.\n\n4. **Presentation and Clarity**: Although the abstract is concise and effectively communicates the main idea, contribution, and result of the paper, a full assessment of the paper's clarity, organization, and overall presentation would require access to the complete manuscript. However, based on the abstract, the authors seem to clearly articulate their motivation, method, and findings.\n\nGiven these considerations, the paper appears to make a significant contribution to the field of adversarial training and neural network robustness. The proposed collaborative approach is novel, and the results, as described, are impactful. Assuming the full paper provides a rigorous methodology, adequately discusses the limitations of the approach, and clearly presents the results and their implications, the paper would be suitable for publication at a top-tier conference.\n\nFinal Decision: Accept"

The proposal of a bi-objective optimization model to maintain a population of agents with both diverse playing styles and high skill levels introduces a novel approach to this problem. This suggests a good level of originality and relevance to the field.\n\n2. **Technical Soundness**: The paper proposes a meta bi-objective model that enables high-level agents with diverse playing styles to be incomparable, thus facilitating their interaction through the training process.

The fact that the algorithm can learn a well-generalized policy and provide a set of high-level policies with various playing styles is a strong indication of its effectiveness.\n\n4. **Clarity and Presentation**: Although the abstract is somewhat dense and could benefit from clearer explanations for a broader audience, it effectively conveys the main contributions and findings of the paper. The structure of the abstract, moving from problem statement to proposed solution and then to experimental validation, is logical and easy to follow.\n\n5. **Impact and Contribution**: The paper's focus on improving the generalization of policies in self-play through diversity in playing styles has the potential to contribute significantly to the field of reinforcement learning. The ability to generate high-level agents with diverse playing styles can enhance the robustness and applicability of reinforcement learning algorithms in complex environments.\n\nConsidering these aspects, the paper demonstrates a clear contribution to the field, a technically sound approach, and robust experimental validation.

For a top-tier conference, it would be crucial to see comprehensive experimental results, including comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, detailed analysis of the learned aggregation strategy, and possibly ablation studies to understand the contribution of each component of FedPA.\n\n4. **Impact and Significance**: The potential impact of this work is significant, given the growing importance of federated learning in enabling privacy-preserving and decentralized machine learning. Improving the convergence and stability of FL methods can have far-reaching implications for various applications, from healthcare to finance, where data privacy is a major concern.\n\n5. **Clarity and Presentation**: Although the abstract provides a clear overview of the problem, the proposed solution, and the experimental validation, the full paper would need to demonstrate rigorous technical detail, clear explanations, and well-organized presentation to facilitate understanding by the audience.\n\nConsidering these aspects, the paper seems to propose a novel and potentially impactful solution to a significant problem in federated learning. However, the final decision would typically depend on a more detailed evaluation of the full paper, including the technical rigor, experimental results, and clarity of presentation.\n\nGiven the information provided and assuming the full paper supports the claims made in the abstract with thorough technical analysis, comprehensive experiments, and clear presentation, the paper appears to have the potential to contribute meaningfully to the field.\n\nFinal Decision: Accept"

      "response": "The paper \"RuDar: Weather Radar Dataset for Precipitation Nowcasting with Geographical and Seasonal Variability\" presents a novel dataset, RuDar, designed for precipitation nowcasting tasks. The dataset incorporates 3D radar echo observations from 30 weather radars in the European part of Russia, covering multiple climate zones. This addition of a third dimension to precipitation measurements is a significant contribution, as existing datasets lack detailed descriptions of reflectivity changes in the vertical dimension, which can simplify or distort forecasting models.\n\nSeveral strengths of the paper support its potential for acceptance:\n\n1. **Novelty and Contribution**: The introduction of the RuDar dataset fills a gap in current precipitation nowcasting research by providing detailed 3D radar echo observations. This is a significant contribution to the field, as it enables more accurate and nuanced modeling of precipitation patterns.\n\n2. **Comprehensive Dataset**: The dataset is extensive, covering over 50,000 timestamps across a two-year period, with a high spatial resolution of 2 km and temporal updates every 10 minutes. This comprehensiveness makes the dataset a valuable resource for researchers in the field.\n\n3. **Evaluation and Benchmarking**: The authors have evaluated several baseline models on the proposed dataset, including optical flow and neural network models, and have also considered uncertainty quantification for ensemble scenarios. This demonstrates the dataset's utility for model development and comparison, a crucial aspect for establishing a benchmark.\n\n4. **Public Availability**: The dataset and code for data processing and model preparation are publicly available, which aligns with the principles of reproducibility and openness in scientific research. This accessibility will facilitate the use of the RuDar dataset by other researchers, potentially leading to further advancements in precipitation nowcasting.\n\n5. **Relevance and Impact**: The paper addresses a critical task in weather forecasting—precipitation nowcasting—with potential applications in various fields, including meteorology, environmental science, and emergency management. The dataset's potential use in other machine learning tasks, such as data shift studying, anomaly detection, or uncertainty estimation, further broadens its impact.\n\nHowever, to ensure the paper meets the high standards of a top-tier conference, it would be beneficial to consider a few aspects in more detail:\n\n- **Methodological Innovations**: While the dataset itself is a significant contribution, the paper could be strengthened by novel methodological approaches to utilizing the dataset, beyond the baseline models evaluated.\n- **Comparative Analysis**: A more detailed comparison with existing datasets and models could provide a clearer picture of the RuDar dataset's advantages and potential limitations.\n- **Applications and Case Studies**: Including specific case studies or applications of the RuDar dataset in real-world scenarios could enhance the paper's impact and demonstrate the practical utility of the dataset.\n\nDespite these considerations, the paper's strengths, particularly the introduction of a novel and comprehensive dataset that addresses a significant gap in precipitation nowcasting research, outweigh its weaknesses.\n\nFinal Decision: Accept"
