      "response": "The paper proposes a novel meta-learning framework called NORML, which uses an LSTM-based meta-learner to perform neuron-wise optimization on a learner for efficient task learning. The authors claim that NORML can potentially scale to learner networks with a large number of parameters and that it learns to make effective weight updates using information from previous data points and update steps.\n\nHowever, after carefully analyzing the paper and the reviewer comments, several concerns and issues arise that cast doubt on the paper's contribution and validity.\n\nFirstly, the reviewers question the novelty of the proposed approach, pointing out that it is similar to previous work, such as Ravi & Larochelle's Meta-Learner LSTM. The authors claim that NORML has fewer parameters than previous approaches, but the reviewers argue that this is not entirely accurate. Specifically, Reviewer 1 points out that Ravi & Larochelle's approach also uses parameter sharing, which reduces the number of parameters in the meta-learner.\n\nSecondly, the experimental results are not convincing, and the reviewers request more comparisons with previous work, such as MAML and Meta-Learner LSTM. Reviewer 3 suggests that the comparison with MAML is not fair, as the authors use a different base learner and do not consider other versions of MAML, such as MAML++.\n\nThirdly, the reviewers criticize the writing style, pointing out numerous grammatical mistakes, inconsistencies in citations, and unclear explanations. Reviewer 2 states that the writing is \"well beyond the ICLR level\" and requires a \"massive overhaul.\"\n\nLastly, the reviewers question the applicability of the proposed approach, as it is limited to fully connected networks and may not be suitable for convolutional networks, which are commonly used in few-shot learning tasks.\n\nGiven these concerns and issues, it is challenging to evaluate the significance of the proposed approach. The authors' claims about the benefits of NORML are not adequately supported by the experimental results, and the reviewers' requests for more comparisons and clarifications are not addressed in the author response.\n\nTherefore, based on the analysis of the paper and the reviewer comments, I conclude that the paper should be rejected due to its limited novelty, inadequate experimental results, and numerous writing and presentation issues.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

      "response": "The paper \"Multi-Precision Policy Enforced Training (MuPPET): A precision-switching strategy for quantised fixed-point training of CNNs\" proposes a novel approach to reduce the training time of deep neural networks by utilizing a multi-precision strategy. The authors introduce a precision-switching mechanism that decides at runtime when to switch between different precision levels, allowing for a balance between training time and accuracy.\n\nThe reviewers have raised several concerns and suggestions for improvement. Reviewer 1 questions the motivation behind the switching mechanism and requests a more detailed explanation. Reviewer 2 points out that the proposed approach does not match the description in the paper and suggests that the authors clarify the setting of quantized precision levels and the presentation of the precision switching policy. Reviewer 3 recommends a weak reject, stating that the core idea of the manuscript is not shown to be a necessary condition for good classification results.\n\nThe authors have responded to the reviewers' comments, providing additional explanations and clarifications. They have also updated the manuscript to address the concerns raised by the reviewers.\n\nAfter carefully analyzing the paper and the reviewers' comments, I believe that the paper has several strengths. The proposed approach is novel and has the potential to reduce the training time of deep neural networks. The authors have demonstrated the effectiveness of their approach on several networks and datasets, and the results show a significant reduction in training time without compromising accuracy.\n\nHowever, the paper also has some weaknesses. The switching mechanism is not fully explained, and the authors could provide more insight into the motivation behind it. Additionally, the presentation of the precision switching policy is confusing, and the notation could be improved.\n\nDespite these weaknesses, I believe that the paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of deep learning. The authors have demonstrated the effectiveness of their approach, and the results are promising. With some revisions to address the concerns raised by the reviewers, I believe that the paper could be improved significantly.\n\nTherefore, I recommend that the paper be accepted for publication, but with some revisions to address the concerns raised by the reviewers.\n\nFinal Decision: Accept"

The abstract suggests a focus on the coordination of episode generation, treating the entire system as a game tree search to balance exploitation and exploration. However, the paper faces significant criticisms from all reviewers, which can be summarized into several key areas:\n\n1. **Lack of Clarity and Poor Writing**: All reviewers agree that the paper is poorly written, with grammatical issues, incomprehensible passages, and a general lack of clarity. This makes it difficult for reviewers to understand the proposed method, its contributions, and its significance. The abstract, which is supposed to provide a clear and concise overview of the paper, is particularly criticized for its vagueness and lack of coherence.\n\n2. **Absence of References**: The paper does not include any references, which is a critical omission in academic writing. References are essential for situating the research within the existing body of knowledge, acknowledging previous work, and demonstrating the novelty and contribution of the proposed method. The author's response that they did not know how to use a.bib file and therefore removed all references is not a valid excuse, especially in a field where academic integrity and proper citation are fundamental.\n\n3. **Lack of Scientific Rigor and Detail**: Reviewers mention that the paper lacks the preliminary elements of scientific writing, including undefined mathematical symbols, poorly explained algorithm boxes, and large sections of blank space. This suggests a lack of rigor in the presentation of the research and its methods, making it impossible to evaluate the paper's technical contributions.\n\n4. **Insufficient Evidence and Evaluation**: While the abstract mentions experiments on a small problem showing robust performance compared to Alpha Zero, the reviewers do not have enough information to assess the validity and significance of these claims. There is no detailed description of the experimental setup, the metrics used for evaluation, or how the proposed method improves upon existing approaches.\n\nGiven these criticisms, the author's response acknowledges some of the issues, such as the need to improve writing skills and the lack of references. However, the response does not address the fundamental concerns about the paper's clarity, scientific rigor, and contribution to the field. The author expresses a desire to learn and improve, which is commendable, but this does not rectify the paper's current shortcomings.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the information provided and the severe criticisms from all reviewers, the paper in its current form does not meet the standards expected of a top-tier conference. The issues with clarity, references, scientific rigor, and the overall presentation are too significant to overlook.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

      "response": "The paper \"Gradient-based training of Gaussian Mixture Models in High-Dimensional Spaces\" presents a novel approach for training Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) in high-dimensional spaces. The authors propose three key ideas: minimizing an upper bound to the GMM log likelihood, introducing a new regularizer to prevent convergence to pathological local minima, and enforcing constraints inherent to GMM training when using SGD.\n\nThe reviewers raise several concerns and suggestions for improvement. Reviewer 1 criticizes the paper for being largely incremental and lacking understanding of the history of online EM. They also question the motivation for the max-component approximation, the use of a standard representation of multinoulli without reference, and the gridding approach for smoothing. Reviewer 2 points out the lack of guarantees for convergence and the need for excellent empirical results. They also raise concerns about the experimental evaluation, including the choice of datasets and the comparison to EM. Reviewer 3 finds the paper to be serious and well-written but notes that the main contribution is the description of a simple method for learning GMMs from random initialization. They also suggest that the paper falls short in showing improvement compared to other baselines.\n\nThe authors respond to the reviewers' comments, addressing concerns about the max-component approximation, the regularizer, and the experimental evaluation. They clarify that their approach is not online EM but rather SGD, which is a different optimization method. They also acknowledge the lack of guarantees for convergence and the need for empirical results.\n\nAfter carefully considering the reviewers' comments and the authors' responses, I conclude that the paper has some merits but also significant weaknesses. The authors' approach to training GMMs using SGD is novel, and their responses to the reviewers' comments demonstrate a good understanding of the concerns raised. However, the paper lacks a clear and compelling motivation for the proposed approach, and the experimental evaluation is limited and not entirely convincing.\n\nThe main concerns that prevent me from accepting the paper are:\n\n1. Lack of clear motivation: The authors do not provide a strong motivation for why SGD is a better choice than EM for training GMMs in high-dimensional spaces.\n2. Limited experimental evaluation: The authors only evaluate their approach on a few datasets, and the comparison to EM is not comprehensive.\n3. Lack of guarantees for convergence: The authors do not provide any guarantees for convergence, which is a significant concern for any optimization method.\n\nGiven these concerns, I believe that the paper requires significant revisions to address the reviewers' comments and improve the overall quality of the paper.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

The authors propose an adversarial softmax approximation method that generates negative samples from an adversarial model, which mimics the data distribution. This approach aims to reduce the gradient variance and improve the convergence rate of the training process.\n\nThe paper has several strengths. Firstly, the authors provide a clear and well-motivated problem statement, and their proposed approach is simple yet effective. The experimental results on two large-scale datasets demonstrate the superiority of their method over several competitive baselines. Additionally, the authors provide a mathematical proof that their adversarial sampling mechanism minimizes the gradient variance, which adds to the paper's theoretical contributions.\n\nHowever, the paper also has some weaknesses. The reviewers have pointed out that the authors do not adequately discuss related work, particularly in the context of non-uniform sampling methods. The authors have responded to these comments by acknowledging the omission and promising to add a discussion of the relevant literature in the final version of the paper.

They suggest that a more complex discriminator, such as a two-layer neural network, would be more realistic and challenging to analyze.\n2. **Limited applicability**: The reviewers question the applicability of the results to more complex generator architectures and discriminator classes. They argue that the analysis is limited to a specific setting and may not generalize to more practical scenarios.\n3. **Lack of clarity**: Some reviewers found the paper difficult to understand, particularly with regards to the choice of discriminator class and the relationship between the quadratic discriminator and the WGAN setting.\n\nThe authors have responded to these concerns, providing additional explanations and justifications for their choices. They argue that:\n\n1. **Quadratic discriminator is sufficient**: The authors claim that the quadratic discriminator has sufficient distinguishing power to learn the family of distributions parametrized by their generator class. They also argue that using a larger discriminator family would increase the sample complexity.\n2. **Focus on one-layer generator**: The authors emphasize that their goal is to understand the dynamics of SGDA with WGAN on learning a one-layer generator, which does not require a complex discriminator.\n3. **Future work**: The authors acknowledge that more complex discriminators may be necessary for future work and suggest that recent developments in neural network training, such as Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) results, could be used to analyze the discriminator dynamics.\n\nAfter carefully considering the reviewers' comments and the authors' responses, I believe that the paper has some merits, but the concerns raised by the reviewers are significant. While the authors have provided some justifications for their choices, the limitations of the analysis and the simplicity of the discriminator class are still a concern.\n\nThe paper's contribution to the field is notable, as it provides a theoretical analysis of the convergence of SGDA in WGANs. However, the applicability and generality of the results are limited by the simplistic discriminator and the focus on a specific generator architecture.\n\nTherefore, I would recommend rejecting the paper in its current form, but encouraging the authors to revise and resubmit with additional analysis and experiments to address the concerns raised by the reviewers.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

The method, called AE-GAN+sr, uses an autoencoder-based approach to purify input images by searching for a closest natural reconstruction in the latent coding space.\n\nThe paper has several strengths. Firstly, the proposed method shows promising results in defending against various types of adversarial attacks, including white-box, black-box, and gray-box attacks. The method is also shown to be computationally efficient, outperforming the Defense-GAN method in terms of computational cost. Additionally, the authors have conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of their method, including comparisons with state-of-the-art adversarial training defenses such as PGD adversarial training.\n\nHowever, the paper also has some weaknesses. One of the main concerns is that the method relies heavily on the autoencoder's ability to detect adversarial samples, which can be susceptible to white-box attacks. The authors have addressed this concern by conducting additional experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of their method against white-box attacks, but more work may be needed to fully address this issue. Another concern is that the paper could benefit from more clarity and readability, with some phrases and sentences being reworded for better understanding.\n\nThe reviewers have provided detailed and constructive feedback, highlighting both the strengths and weaknesses of the paper. Reviewer 1 praises the paper for its promising results and computational efficiency, but notes that the method may not be robust against stronger white-box attacks. Reviewer 2 suggests that the paper could benefit from more comparisons with state-of-the-art adversarial training defenses and notes that the method may not be effective against more complex datasets. Reviewer 3 raises concerns about the reliance on the autoencoder's ability to detect adversarial samples and suggests that more work may be needed to address this issue.

Novel approach: The proposed Differentiable Hebbian Consolidation model offers a fresh perspective on addressing catastrophic forgetting in neural networks.\n2. Flexibility: The method can be integrated with other task-specific synaptic consolidation methods, demonstrating its versatility.\n3. Improved performance: The authors show that their approach outperforms comparable baselines in various benchmarks, including Permuted MNIST, Split MNIST, and Vision Datasets Mixture.\n4.

Limited empirical evaluation: Although the authors add more experiments in response to reviewer comments, some reviewers still express concerns about the comprehensiveness of the empirical evaluation.\n2. Comparison to other methods: The authors could provide more detailed comparisons to other CLS-based approaches and rehearsal-based techniques to further demonstrate the effectiveness of their method.\n3. Hyperparameter tuning: The authors mention that the initial value of the Hebbian learning rate η is the only hyperparameter introduced by DHP Softmax, but they do not provide an extensive analysis of its impact on the results.\n\nAfter carefully considering the reviewer comments, author responses, and the paper's strengths and weaknesses, I conclude that the paper has the potential to make a valuable contribution to the field of continual learning.

The authors should provide more justification for this choice or experiment with other predictors.\n3. **Timing results**: The paper lacks detailed timing results, which are essential for understanding the model's efficiency.\n4. **Comparison to existing methods**: The paper could provide more detailed comparisons to existing methods, including GQE and Q2B, to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach.\n\nTo address these weaknesses, the authors have provided additional experiments, clarifications, and justifications in their response. They have also updated their paper to include more detailed timing results, comparisons to existing methods, and explanations for their choice of neural link predictor.\n\nBased on the analysis of the paper and the reviewers' comments, I conclude that the paper has made significant contributions to the field of complex query answering on incomplete KGs. The authors have addressed the reviewers' concerns and provided additional experiments and clarifications to support their claims.\n\nFinal Decision: Accept"

The authors aim to connect the fields of discrete distribution-property estimation and kernel-based hypothesis testing.\n\nHowever, upon careful analysis of the paper, reviewer comments, and author responses, several major concerns arise that significantly impact the paper's quality and validity.\n\n1. **Lack of Clarity and Consistency**: Reviewers have pointed out numerous instances of confusing notation, unclear definitions, and inconsistencies in the presentation. For example, the use of \"K\" to represent different concepts (kernel between distributions, kernel between values, and gram matrix) is confusing. Although the authors have attempted to address these issues in their response, the lack of clarity and consistency in the initial submission raises concerns about the paper's overall quality.\n\n2. **Theoretical Flaws and Missing Proofs**: Reviewers have identified several theoretical flaws, including the missing proof of Theorem 5, unclear definitions (e.g., Definition 2 and Definition 6), and the lack of analysis showing the usefulness of the proposed estimators. The authors' response acknowledges some of these issues, such as the incorrect proof of Theorem 7 related to KSD, which has been removed. However, the removal of significant parts of the paper without adequate replacement or clarification weakens the submission.\n\n3. **Insufficient Experimental Evaluation**: The paper lacks experimental evaluation, which is a critical component of any research paper, especially in the field of machine learning and statistics. The authors' response does not provide a clear plan for addressing this significant omission.\n\n4. **Questionable Motivation and Relevance**: Some reviewers have questioned the motivation behind the proposed GPK, particularly in the context of discrete distributions where labels may not relate to any notion of distance or ordering. The authors' response attempts to address this by mentioning the word2vec technique in NLP tasks, but this example may not be directly relevant to the broader applicability of GPK.\n\n5. **Typos, Imprecisions, and Lack of Rigor**: The paper is criticized for having numerous typos, imprecisions, and a lack of rigor in introducing mathematical concepts. While the authors acknowledge these issues and promise to correct them, the initial submission's poor quality reflects poorly on the authors' attention to detail and professionalism.\n\nGiven these significant concerns, it is clear that the paper, in its current form, does not meet the standards expected of a top-tier conference.

      "response": "The paper \"Language Controls More Than Top-Down Attention: Modulating Bottom-Up Visual Processing with Referring Expressions\" presents a novel approach to integrating linguistic and visual information for image segmentation tasks based on referring expressions. The authors argue that using language to modulate both top-down and bottom-up visual processing can improve performance over traditional methods that only consider top-down attention. The paper includes experiments on several datasets, demonstrating significant improvements when language is used to control filters for bottom-up visual processing in addition to top-down attention.\n\nThe reviewer comments provide a range of perspectives on the paper's strengths and weaknesses. Reviewer 1 suggests that the novelty and contribution of the paper are thin, citing a lack of exploration of different language modeling approaches. However, they also provide constructive suggestions for improving the paper, including adding figures to explain key concepts and citing relevant papers. Reviewer 2 raises concerns about the empirical results, noting that the full model struggles to match existing works on certain metrics and suggesting possible over-tuning. Reviewer 3 is more positive, praising the paper's well-written presentation, important question, and impressive qualitative examples. Reviewer 4 votes for rejection, citing poor conceptual motivation, insufficient error analysis, and a lack of clear understanding of the model's contributions.\n\nThe authors' responses to the reviewer comments address several of the concerns raised. They provide additional explanations for their model design choices, clarify their experimental methodology, and offer to conduct further analyses to better understand the interaction between language and visual processing. However, some reviewers remain unconvinced, questioning the significance of the empirical results and the originality of the model.\n\nAfter carefully considering the paper and the reviewer comments, several key points emerge:\n\n1. **Novelty and Contribution**: While some reviewers question the novelty of the approach, the authors' use of language to modulate both top-down and bottom-up visual processing represents a distinct contribution to the field. The ablation studies demonstrating the importance of both modalities for improved performance support this claim.\n\n2. **Empirical Results**: The paper presents competitive or state-of-the-art results on several datasets, which is a significant achievement. However, concerns about over-tuning and the variability of results across different evaluation sets are valid and should be addressed through additional analyses or significance tests.\n\n3. **Conceptual Motivation and Error Analysis**: The authors could strengthen their paper by providing a clearer conceptual motivation for their model design, potentially drawing more explicitly from cognitive science literature on language and visual processing. Additionally, more detailed error analyses or visualizations of how language influences visual processing would enhance the paper's impact.\n\n4. **Originality and Comparison to Existing Work**: The comparison to Step-ConvRNN and other models is crucial. The authors argue that their model is distinct and more suitable for ablation studies, which is a reasonable point. However, a more detailed comparison, potentially including architectural diagrams or a more in-depth discussion of how their model differs from and improves upon existing approaches, would be beneficial.\n\nConsidering these points, the decision to accept or reject the paper hinges on the balance between its contributions, the quality of its empirical results, and the clarity of its conceptual motivation and analysis. While the paper has its weaknesses, particularly in terms of providing a deeper understanding of how language modulates visual processing and addressing concerns about over-tuning, its strengths in terms of novelty, empirical performance, and the importance of its research question are significant.\n\nFinal Decision: Accept"

The paper evaluates the proposed model using real-world data from the Maryland 2018 midterm elections and reports promising results.\n\nHowever, upon careful analysis of the reviewer comments, several concerns arise that impact the paper's suitability for publication in a top-tier conference. \n\n1. **Clarity and Readability**: Multiple reviewers (Reviewer 1, Reviewer 2, and Reviewer 4) mention that the paper is not easy to follow, with suggestions for improving the structure, particularly in the introduction of key concepts and the description of input data and evaluation tasks. This lack of clarity hampers the understanding and assessment of the paper's contributions.\n\n2. **Experimental Analysis and Baselines**: Reviewer 2 criticizes the paper for incomplete and unclear experiments, lacking key analyses and baselines. For instance, the comparison to a standard multi-level model (MLM) as a baseline is missing, which is crucial for understanding the improvements brought by the deep MLM. Additionally, the paper lacks detailed experimental settings, such as how train/test splits are created, the specifics of neural network architectures, and the choice of hyperparameters.\n\n3. **Reproducibility**: The absence of detailed experimental settings and hyperparameter choices, as pointed out by Reviewer 2 and Reviewer 4, hampers the reproducibility of the results. This is a significant concern for any research paper, especially in a field like machine learning where experimental verification is crucial.\n\n4. **Novelty and Related Work**: Reviewer 4 questions the novelty of the proposed approach, suggesting that it may not be new and that related work is not adequately cited. This includes connections to other problems like learning with label proportions, distribution regression, multiple-instance learning, and collective graphical models. A thorough discussion of related work and how the proposed method advances the state-of-the-art is essential.\n\n5. **Typos and Minor Errors**: Several reviewers mention the presence of typos and minor writing issues throughout the paper. While these are not critical, they reflect a lack of thorough editing and attention to detail.\n\nGiven these concerns, despite the paper's interesting approach and important research area, the issues with clarity, experimental analysis, reproducibility, novelty, and presentation are significant enough to warrant rejection. The authors need to address these concerns through revisions that improve the paper's clarity, provide more comprehensive and clear experimental analyses, ensure reproducibility, adequately discuss related work, and correct minor errors.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

Although Reviewer 3 finds the presentation easy to follow despite typos and grammar errors, the consensus among reviewers highlights the need for improvement in this area.\n\n2. **Limited Empirical Evaluation**: The paper's empirical evaluation is limited to the SameGame domain, which Reviewer 1 describes as \"relatively toy-ish.\" This limited scope makes it challenging to assess the method's generalizability and effectiveness across different domains. Reviewers 1, 2, and 3 all suggest comparing the MCTransformer with other state-of-the-art methods, including Decision Transformers, Online DTs, AlphaGo, AlphaZero, and MuZero, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of its performance.\n\n3. **Novelty Concerns**: Reviewers 2 and 3 express concerns about the paper's novelty, suggesting that the combination of MCTS and Transformers, while interesting, does not significantly deviate from existing approaches like AlphaGo/AlphaZero. The method's originality is questioned, with Reviewer 2 stating that the structure is \"identical\" to AlphaGo/AlphaZero's setting, except for replacing the neural network with a Transformer.\n\n4. **Methodological Concerns**: Reviewer 2 points out that the comparison between MCTransformer and MCTS-only solutions might be unfair, as the MCTS-based program could execute more simulation counts without using neural networks. This raises questions about the fairness and convincingness of the empirical evaluation.\n\n5. **Reproducibility**: While Reviewer 3 mentions that the paper provides enough information for reproducibility, the lack of source code and detailed experimental settings (e.g., specific hyperparameters, computational resources) could hinder exact replication.\n\nGiven these considerations, the paper faces significant challenges in terms of clarity, empirical evaluation, novelty, and methodological soundness. While the idea of combining MCTS with Transformers is promising, the current presentation and evaluation do not sufficiently support the paper's claims of superiority over existing methods or demonstrate significant novelty.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

The paper is well-written, easy to follow, and presents a clear motivation for the proposed approach. However, after carefully analyzing the reviewer comments, several concerns arise that impact the paper's overall quality, novelty, and significance.\n\nFirstly, the novelty of the paper is questioned by multiple reviewers. Reviewer 1 states that the core idea of penalizing previously generated tokens has been proposed before, and the authors' claim that unlikelihood training only considers the probabilities of negative tokens is disputed. Reviewer 3 also mentions that the idea is very similar to \"unlikelihood training.\" This lack of novelty is a significant concern, as top-tier conferences typically expect innovative and groundbreaking research.\n\nSecondly, the experimental setup and results are criticized by several reviewers. Reviewer 1 suggests that the experiments are insufficient and that the metrics used (e.g., perplexity) are not reliable for evaluating text generation tasks. Reviewer 2 points out that the experimental setup is weak, using only GPT2-small fine-tuned on WikiText, and that the results are not convincing. Reviewer 4 also questions the importance of the repetition issue for better or larger models and suggests that scaling experiments could help resolve this question.\n\nThirdly, the human evaluation results are not statistically significant, which raises concerns about the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Reviewer 4 mentions that the human evaluation does not show a preference for the proposed method over one of the baselines (UL-TS).\n\nLastly, the author response is missing, which would have provided an opportunity for the authors to address the reviewers' concerns and clarify any misunderstandings.\n\nConsidering these concerns, the paper's overall quality, novelty, and significance are not sufficient to meet the standards of a top-tier conference. While the paper is well-written and presents an interesting idea, the lack of novelty, insufficient experiments, and non-statistically significant human evaluation results are significant drawbacks.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

Here are the key issues:\n\n1. **Lack of clarity and poor writing**: Multiple reviewers (Reviewer 1, Reviewer 2, Reviewer 3, and Reviewer 4) criticize the paper's writing style, noting that it is poorly written, lacks detail, and contains grammatical mistakes. This makes it difficult for readers to understand the methodology and results.\n2. **Insufficient experimental validation**: Reviewers 2 and 4 point out that the paper lacks comprehensive experimental comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, which is a crucial aspect of evaluating the effectiveness of a new approach. The authors only compare their method to some graph embedding algorithms, which is not sufficient.\n3. **Limited novelty**: Reviewers 1, 3, and 4 question the novelty of the paper, suggesting that the approach is not significantly new or innovative. The method combines existing techniques, and the authors fail to provide a clear and rigorous demonstration of their claims.\n4. **Overreliance on pre-trained object detection network**: Reviewer 4 notes that the proposed method relies heavily on a pre-trained object detection network, which may not be suitable for all types of in-distribution data (e.g., medical images). This limitation is not adequately addressed in the paper.\n5. **Lack of ablation studies and interpretability analysis**: Reviewer 4 suggests that the paper lacks essential ablation studies to analyze the impact of hyperparameters and the interpretability of the OOD detection results using semantic graphs.\n\nGiven these concerns, it is clear that the paper requires significant revisions to address the issues raised by the reviewers. The authors need to improve the writing style, provide more comprehensive experimental comparisons, and demonstrate the novelty and significance of their approach more rigorously.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

The authors provide empirical evidence to support their claims and propose metrics to measure saturation and sparsity.\n\nHowever, the paper has several weaknesses that need to be addressed. Firstly, the claims about the benefits of asymmetric saturation and its relationship to generalization performance are not clearly supported by the experiments. The authors' argument that asymmetric saturation leads to higher sparsity, which in turn improves generalization, is not convincing. The experiments show that the relationship between saturation, sparsity, and generalization performance is more complex and depends on various factors, such as the depth of the layers and the specific architecture used.\n\nSecondly, the paper lacks a clear and rigorous definition of the \"center of the function\" and its implications for the analysis. The authors' response to the reviewers' comments clarifies some of these issues, but the paper could benefit from a more detailed and precise explanation of these concepts.\n\nThirdly, the experimental setup and analysis have some limitations. The authors only consider a specific set of architectures and activation functions, and the results may not generalize to other settings.

Some consider it marginally novel, while others see it as not particularly new, citing existing ensemble methods for adversarial training. The lack of a clear, groundbreaking contribution might be a concern.\n\n2. **Technical Quality and Significance**: The paper demonstrates improved robustness against AutoAttack on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets, which is a positive aspect. However, the reviewers have raised several questions about the theoretical analysis, the necessity of training two models from scratch, and the comparison with other baselines, especially ensemble methods and data augmentation approaches.\n\n3. **Empirical Evidence and Reproducibility**: The experiments are extensive but limited to small-scale datasets (CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100). Reviewers have suggested that larger datasets (like ImageNet) and more network architectures should be considered for a more comprehensive evaluation. The reproducibility of the results is also questioned, with some reviewers suggesting that the code should be made available.\n\n4. **Clarity and Writing Quality**: The paper is generally considered well-written and easy to follow, which is a positive aspect.

The paper shows that FRM can subsume Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) for many common loss functions and provides an avenue for more realistic noise processes.\n\nThe reviewers have identified several strengths and weaknesses of the paper. The main strengths include:\n\n1. **Novelty and Potential Impact**: The paper presents a very interesting and novel take on representing noise in a learning framework, which could be highly impactful as it may allow for more easily dealing with the variation in real datasets than standard MLE in additive noise models.\n2. **Empirical Results**: The empirical results on linear regression with non-uniform noise seem to be strong, demonstrating that as the noise distribution changes, FRM begins to outperform ERM.\n3. **Well-written Article**: The paper is well-written, with examples given to show the motivation and clarify some concepts.\n\nHowever, the reviewers have also identified several weaknesses, including:\n\n1. **Lack of Clarity**: The presentation is confusing, with non-standard use of terms like \"ERM\" and unclear distinction between the FGM modeling assumption and the FRM learning objective.\n2. **Scalability Concerns**: The implementable algorithm as proposed does not seem to be scalable, requiring significant approximation and Hessian information that could be difficult to obtain for large models.\n3. **Lack of Theoretical Guarantees**: There is no formal argument made as to why or when FRM will outperform ERM, and no arguments showing that the FRM minimizer will achieve low loss or that the finite-sample version of FRM approximates the population variant.\n\nThe authors have responded to these concerns, providing additional experiments and clarifications on scalability. They have shown that FRM can be scalable to real datasets and neural networks, and that it can lead to better representations in the bottleneck layer of a VAE. They have also addressed concerns about the scalability of FRM, discussing the accuracy and scalability of the approximation and highlighting the potential for FRM to lead to radically increasing the scalability of NN training.\n\nAfter carefully considering the strengths and weaknesses of the paper, as well as the authors' responses to the reviewers' concerns, I believe that the paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of machine learning.

      "response": "The paper under review explores the problem of online black-box adaptation to label-shift in the presence of conditional-shift. The authors propose several heuristics to improve the performance of existing label-shift adaptation methods in this setting. The paper is well-motivated, and the problem it addresses is relevant to real-world applications.\n\nHowever, the reviewers have raised several concerns about the paper. One major issue is the lack of a systematic approach to understanding the types of distribution shifts considered. The paper focuses on general distribution shifts, but the experiments do not provide clear insights into when the proposed methods can be expected to improve upon baselines. The reviewers have suggested that a more comprehensive empirical study is necessary to ascertain the usefulness of the proposed methods.\n\nAnother concern is the lack of theoretical justification for the proposed heuristics. The authors acknowledge this limitation and view their work as an empirical study. However, the reviewers have emphasized the importance of providing a more principled approach to the problem.\n\nThe paper has also been criticized for its writing quality, with some sections being unclear or difficult to follow. The authors have responded to these concerns by revising their draft and providing additional explanations and clarifications.\n\nThe reviewers have also pointed out that the proposed heuristics are not significantly novel or distinguishable from existing methods. The authors have acknowledged this limitation and emphasized the importance of their empirical study in providing insights into the practical implications of the strong assumptions typically made in experimentation.\n\nAfter carefully considering the reviewers' comments and the authors' responses, I conclude that the paper has some merits, but its limitations and weaknesses outweigh its strengths. The lack of a systematic approach to understanding the types of distribution shifts, the lack of theoretical justification for the proposed heuristics, and the limited novelty of the proposed methods are significant concerns.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

      "response": "The paper \"Multi Task Learning of Different Class Label Representations for Stronger Models\" proposes a novel approach to improve image classification performance by using binary labels as an auxiliary task in a multi-task learning setting. The authors demonstrate that this approach can lead to higher accuracy across various datasets and architectures, especially when training data is limited.\n\nHowever, the reviewers have raised several concerns that need to be addressed. Reviewer 1 points out that the paper lacks clarity, with unclear explanations of key concepts such as \"dense labels\" and \"Metabalance.\" The reviewer also notes that the experimental section is weak, with insufficient comparisons to baselines and limited analysis of the results. Reviewer 2 criticizes the paper for poor notation, calculation errors, and a lack of insight into the algorithm. Reviewer 3 suggests that the contribution may not be significant enough due to the small empirical improvements and the lack of further analysis. Reviewer 4 notes that the technical contribution is limited, and the paper does not clearly explain how the binary labels improve the learning.\n\nDespite these concerns, the reviewers also acknowledge the novelty and potential of the approach. Reviewer 1 notes that the idea is interesting and agrees that label representations are an understudied aspect of machine learning. Reviewer 3 finds the paper to be clearly written and easy to understand, and suggests that the authors expand on the results by exploring some of the questions listed in the conclusions section.\n\nTo determine whether the paper should be accepted or rejected, we need to weigh the strengths and weaknesses of the paper. The paper's novelty and potential are significant strengths, but the concerns raised by the reviewers need to be addressed. The lack of clarity, insufficient experimental analysis, and limited technical contribution are significant weaknesses.\n\nGiven the current state of the paper, it seems that the weaknesses outweigh the strengths. The authors have not provided a response to address the concerns raised by the reviewers, which suggests that they may not be able to adequately address the issues.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

This indicates that the paper does offer some level of novelty and significance to the field.\n\n2. **Clarity, Quality, and Reproducibility**: Several reviewers (1, 2, and 5) criticize the paper for being poorly written, with issues in clarity, quality, and reproducibility. Reviewer 5 states that the paper is inaccessible to an ordinary reader due to its suboptimal writing. However, Reviewer 4 suggests that the paper is generally pleasant to read, although they also mention areas for improvement in clarity and reproducibility.\n\n3. **Correctness**: The reviews are mixed regarding the correctness of the paper's claims. Reviewer 1 gives a score of 3, indicating some minor issues, while Reviewer 2 scores 2, suggesting several claims are incorrect or not well-supported. Reviewer 3 scores 4, indicating all claims are well-supported, but Reviewer 5 scores 1, stating the main claims are incorrect or not supported.\n\n4. **Empirical and Technical Contributions**: The paper presents numerical experiments that, according to the authors, confirm their theoretical predictions. However, some reviewers question the practicality of certain assumptions (e.g., knowing the signal matrix) and the comparison between theoretical and empirical results.\n\n5. **Response to Reviews**: The authors acknowledge the criticisms and suggest they will revise the paper to address issues of clarity, organization, and reproducibility. They also clarify some of the technical points raised by the reviewers.\n\nConsidering these points, the decision to accept or reject the paper hinges on the balance between its technical contributions and the issues with clarity, quality, and reproducibility.

The reviewers have provided detailed comments on the paper's strengths, weaknesses, clarity, quality, novelty, and reproducibility.\n\nReviewer 1 points out that the idea of splitting a neural network into two parts is not new, and the paper's experimental analysis is limited, considering only two datasets and a single baseline. The reviewer also mentions grammatical errors and questions the paper's novelty, stating that it is an incremental effort over state-of-the-art methods.\n\nReviewer 2 raises severe concerns about the proposed approach, stating that it is flawed due to the requirement of fine-tuning the encoder component, which can only be done during the training phase. The reviewer also points out that the server can easily recreate a \"surrogate\" encoder, making the approach vulnerable to privacy leakage. Additionally, the reviewer criticizes the paper's threat model, stating that it is completely messed up, and the server can turn off the center loss to zero and backpropagate only the cross-entropy loss, making the client unable to verify it.\n\nReviewer 3 also raises concerns about the paper's security model, stating that it is not defined, and using middle features of neural networks is still risky for information leakage. The reviewer also questions the paper's ability to guarantee privacy and points out that the proposed model may not work for NLP applications.\n\nAll reviewers agree that the paper's technical novelty and significance are only marginally significant or novel. They also agree that the paper's empirical novelty and significance are limited, and the contributions are not well-supported.\n\nConsidering the reviewers' comments, the paper's limitations, and the lack of an author response, it is clear that the paper has significant flaws and weaknesses.

The main concerns raised by the reviewers include:\n\n1. **Lack of comparison with prior work**: Reviewer 2 points out that the paper does not give enough credit to the prior work PP16, which studied the average-case performance of replicator dynamics in potential games. The authors have responded to this comment by adding a paragraph explaining the similarities and differences with PP16.\n2. **Limited scope**: Reviewers 2 and 3 note that the paper's results are limited to 2x2 symmetric coordination games, which is a restricted case. The authors acknowledge this limitation but argue that their results are a necessary step towards proving positive average price of anarchy (APoA) bounds in larger instances.\n3. **Lack of formal proofs**: Reviewer 3 comments that the paper's results are partial and feel preliminary, with no formal proof for the general case. The authors respond that their empirical analysis provides evidence for their claims, but they acknowledge the need for more formal proofs.\n4. **Technical novelty and significance**: Reviewers 2 and 3 rate the paper's technical novelty and significance as marginal, while Reviewer 4 rates it as significant.\n\nDespite these concerns, the reviewers also praise the paper's strengths, including:\n\n1. **Well-written and easy to read**: Reviewers 2 and 3 comment that the paper is well-written and easy to read.\n2. **Interesting problem**: Reviewers 2 and 3 note that the problem studied in the paper is interesting and challenging.\n3. **Solid results**: Reviewer 2 comments that the results are solid, and Reviewer 4 rates the paper's correctness as 4 (out of 5).\n\nAfter carefully considering the reviewers' comments and the authors' responses, I conclude that the paper has made a significant contribution to the study of average-case performance of no-regret learning dynamics.

This addresses both client drift and period drift, issues that are significant in federated learning due to the heterogeneity of decentralized data. Reviewers acknowledge the importance of tackling these drifts but question the novelty and significance of the proposed method compared to existing works.\n\n2. **Technical Quality and Correctness**: Reviewers have pointed out several technical issues, including the lack of theoretical justification for the effectiveness of FedPA, the similarity of the proposed method to other knowledge distillation-based techniques, and the need for more ablation studies to understand the impact of different components of the algorithm. Additionally, there are concerns about the experimental settings being too simple and not comprehensive enough.\n\n3. **Empirical Evidence**: The paper presents experimental results showing that FedPA can achieve competitive performances compared to conventional baselines. However, reviewers suggest that the experimental settings are not strong, with too simple datasets and models, and there's a need for results on more complex datasets like CIFAR-100 and Stack Overflow.\n\n4. **Clarity, Quality, and Reproducibility**: Reviewers have noted issues with the paper's clarity and quality, including grammatical mistakes, small font sizes in figures, and a lack of code availability, which hampers reproducibility. There are also suggestions for improving the writing and providing more details on hyperparameter tuning.\n\n5. **Comparison with Existing Works**: The reviewers emphasize the need for a more thorough comparison with existing methods, especially those that also address client and period drift in federated learning. This includes justifying why a meta-learning approach is preferred over regularization-based approaches.\n\nGiven these considerations, the paper has some promising aspects, such as addressing an important problem in federated learning and showing competitive performance in some experiments. However, it also has significant weaknesses, including technical issues, a lack of comprehensive experimental validation, and concerns about novelty and significance compared to existing works.\n\nThe absence of an author response means that the authors have not addressed the reviewers' concerns, which is a critical aspect of the review process, especially for a top-tier conference where the standards for acceptance are high.\n\n**Final Decision: Reject**"
