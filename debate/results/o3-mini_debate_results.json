The authors innovate by adapting concepts from multiple instance learning to the task of trajectory segmentation, allowing the segmentation process to be end‐to‐end trainable and to work directly from high‐dimensional inputs (such as images). This is particularly noteworthy because it alleviates the heavy reliance on manually annotated segmentation, which is often tedious and biased.\n\nFurthermore, the paper emphasizes its practical applicability by rigorously evaluating the approach across four distinct environments, spanning simulation and real-world robots, as well as discrete and continuous action spaces. The inclusion of demonstrations derived from both procedurally generated and human-collected data bolsters the claim that the method is robust and adaptable. Additional evidence of the method's utility is provided via preliminary experiments on zero-shot transfer to new combinations of skills—a promising step toward broader generalization in robot learning.\n\nWhile the approach builds upon established frameworks like multiple instance learning, its application in the context of weakly-supervised trajectory segmentation for robotics, alongside the comprehensive experimental validation, represents a solid advancement. The work is well-motivated, addresses an important problem, and its extensive evaluation indicates both technical rigor and broad potential impact in the field.\n\nFinal Decision: Accept"

Novelty and Technical Contributions: The authors propose a mixture of temporal cascades where a node’s representation depends not only on its history but also on those of nodes it interacts with. Extending the LSTM architecture with novel time gates to effectively model varying time intervals, along with a selection mechanism to identify influential nodes within k-hop subgraphs, shows significant innovation. Stacking representations at several layers and fusing them using attention mechanisms further adds to the methodological novelty.\n\n2.

Novelty and Relevance: The paper makes an interesting connection between the expressivity of ReLU networks and a classical result in dynamical systems, Sharkovsky’s Theorem. By linking periodic points (including the notion of period 3 leading to chaotic behavior) with neural network function approximation, the work builds upon Telgarsky's influential insights. This cross-disciplinary perspective appears novel and promising, addressing an important open question regarding why certain functions are hard to represent with shallow networks.\n\n2. Technical Contributions: The approach is grounded in an eigenvalue analysis of the dynamical systems inherent to the functions under consideration. Providing lower bounds on the width required as a function of depth for functions containing periodic elements is a significant theoretical advancement. Although the abstract does not detail all technical proofs and derivations, the high-level presentation suggests a substantive contribution to our understanding of depth-width trade-offs in neural network architectures.\n\n3. Impact and Broader Significance: Recognizing function classes that are difficult to approximate with shallow architectures is central to both theoretical and practical neural network design. By characterizing such functions through dynamical systems concepts, this work can potentially inspire further research, not only in deep learning theory but also in the application of dynamical systems techniques to neural network analysis.\n\n4. Clarity and Presentation: The abstract clearly states the motivation, approach, and implications of the study. While more detailed exposition (e.g., specific theorems, proofs, and empirical validation) is necessary to fully appreciate the contributions, the overall direction and novelty are communicated effectively.\n\n5. Possible Weaknesses: One potential concern is whether the results generalize beyond the specific family of functions with chaotic behavior indicated by periodic points.

The authors propose to use Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) to overcome these issues, and they contribute three novel ideas: \n\n1. They introduce an upper bound on the GMM log-likelihood as a surrogate objective, arguing that this approach is more numerically stable in high-dimensional scenarios. This represents a significant technical insight since ensuring stability in gradient-based updates for probabilistic models is challenging.\n\n2. They propose a new regularizer designed specifically to prevent the convergence to pathological local minima during SGD optimization. Given that local optima are a known risk in non-convex optimization, this aspect is both theoretically interesting and practically relevant.\n\n3. They develop a simple method for enforcing the constraints inherent in GMM training when using SGD, along with a simplification of the full GMM model via local principal directions to manage the quadratic memory growth associated with high-dimensional covariance matrices.

Novelty and Technical Contribution: The paper introduces a Differentiable Hebbian Consolidation approach that augments a standard neural network with a DHP Softmax layer. This layer incorporates a rapid learning plastic component alongside a fixed, slow-changing set of weights. The idea of fuse plasticity (inspired by Hebbian principles) with synaptic consolidation is a creative step towards mitigating catastrophic forgetting in continual learning. Although Hebbian mechanisms have been studied in prior work, the integration into a differentiable, consolidated softmax layer (and its demonstrated compatibility with task-specific consolidation penalties) is novel and of interest to the community.\n\n2. Experimental Evaluation: The authors evaluate their model on a range of standard continual learning benchmarks such as Permuted MNIST, Split MNIST, and a Vision Datasets Mixture. In addition, the introduction of an imbalanced Permuted MNIST variant that captures challenges of class imbalance along with concept drift is a noteworthy contribution. Conducting experiments on multiple benchmarks with competitive baselines strengthens the empirical claims.\n\n3. Practicality and Simplicity: The fact that the proposed method adds no additional hyperparameters (or at least requires no new tuning) is a practical advantage. This offers a compelling trade-off between model complexity and performance, a feature that top-tier conferences value.\n\n4. Scientific Impact: Continual learning remains a critical research area with significant real-world implications. The method’s capability to reduce catastrophic forgetting by integrating rapid plastic changes with longer-term consolidation could spark further work in biologically inspired learning strategies, making it relevant for cross-disciplinary audiences.\n\nDespite potential concerns about the limited scope (focusing on the softmax layer rather than the entire network) or further scalability to even larger problems, the paper’s contributions – both in terms of mechanism and thorough evaluation – meet the rigorous standards of a top-tier conference.\n\nFinal Decision: Accept"

This stands in contrast to most singing voice synthesis work that relies heavily on pre-assigned musical scores and explicit texts. Formulating “free singer,” “accompanied singer,” and “solo singer” setups shows an innovative approach that could open up new directions in controllable generative audio.\n• This “score and lyrics‐free” formulation is of clear interest to the community focusing on generative models and audio synthesis.\n\n2. Technical Approach:\n• The integration of source separation, transcription models, and adversarial networks (GANs) into a pipeline is intricate and promising. Leveraging these components to generate singing voice audios in unconstrained settings is a challenging engineering and modeling effort.\n• The paper’s exploration of different schemes (free, accompanied, and solo) indicates that the authors have invested in investigating a range of formulations. This shows depth in approaching the problem from multiple angles.\n• However, the technical parts seem to rely on known building blocks. The novelty lies more in the system integration and problem formulation rather than in fundamentally novel algorithms. In a top-tier conference, such integration can be compelling if it convincingly pushes boundaries and demonstrates solid empirical gains.\n\n3. Evaluation and Metrics:\n• Customized metrics for a challenging task such as free singing voice generation show that the authors have thought carefully about evaluation, which is an important contribution given the subjective nature of audio quality evaluation.\n• It would be important that these metrics are validated and correlated to perceptual quality, and that rigorous experiments are shown to support the claims. Assuming the experimental section (not fully detailed in the abstract) backs these claims, the evaluation is a strength.\n\n4. Overall Contribution:\n• The paper explores a difficult and novel alternative to synthesizing singing voice, going beyond condition-based synthesis. The proposed pipeline and detailed discussion of challenges represent a valuable contribution to the field.\n• Although many components might be adaptations of existing techniques (preprocessing, GAN-based synthesis), the overall pipeline addressing spontaneous singing voice generation is a creative synthesis, and it is well-suited to a top-tier conference audience.\n\nHaving considered the novelty, technical effort, and significance of the work, I conclude that this paper is a strong candidate for acceptance, assuming that the experimental results and evaluations stand robustly as indicated in the abstract.\n\nFinal Decision: Accept"

This design effectively addresses the challenge of decomposing a complex task into learnable components.\n• Relevance and Scope: The work is aligned with important topics in robotics and reinforcement learning, particularly in multi-end-effector or multi-agent systems.

Novelty and Contribution:\n• The paper introduces a multi-precision training strategy (MuPPET) that goes beyond the typical mixed-precision approaches (i.e., FP32 with FP16/FP8) by including low-precision fixed-point representations. The precision-switching mechanism that dynamically changes number representations during training is a novel angle that fits the current push to exploit hardware capabilities more effectively.\n• Although there has been prior work on mixed-precision training, the extension to include fixed-point regimes and the runtime policy to switch precisions appears to be an innovative contribution.\n\n2. Experimental Evaluation:\n• The experiments are conducted on widely recognized CNN architectures (AlexNet, ResNet18, and GoogLeNet) and on a challenging dataset (ImageNet). This ensures that the results are robust and relevant.\n• Reporting the preservation of accuracy while achieving an average training-time speedup of 1.28× shows both practical viability and promise. In addition, the claim of improved energy efficiency adds to its appeal since energy consumption is an important metric in modern deep learning practices.\n\n3. Relevance to Top-Tier Conferences:\n• The study addresses a significant issue in deep learning—long training times—which is a topic of interest for both academia and industry.\n• The methodology tailors training to leverage specific hardware-level capabilities (in this case, an NVIDIA Turing GPU), which is highly relevant as hardware-software co-design becomes an important strand of research.\n• While the speedup of 1.28× could be seen as modest, in the context of large-scale networks this improvement, combined with energy efficiency benefits, represents a meaningful advance.\n\n4. Potential Concerns:\n• The abstract leaves some open questions regarding the level of detail provided for the precision-switching algorithm and its generalizability to other hardware platforms. However, such concerns can be addressed in the longer body of the paper.\n• Another point is that while the improvement margin is incremental relative to some more radical algorithmic advances, the approach is practical and could have significant impact in real-world training scenarios.\n\nOn balance, the paper presents a novel method with sound experimental validation that fits the standards of innovation and rigor expected at a top-tier conference.\n\nFinal Decision: Accept"

Novel Problem Formulation and Motivation:\n The paper tackles unsupervised domain adaptation—a challenging area in computer vision—by proposing that different domains should be processed with distinct sequences of operations. This contrasts with standard approaches that apply a uniform processing pipeline to all domains (even when using multi-stream architectures). The insight that certain domains may require more sophisticated operations than others is well motivated and relevant for computer vision tasks dealing with domain shifts.\n\n2. Methodological Innovation:\n The proposed Domain Adaptive Multibranch Networks introduce a framework in which each domain is allowed its own tailored series of operations. In theory, this provides greater flexibility, which could be particularly useful when domains vary significantly in complexity. The idea of dynamically routing domains through different branches based on their particular characteristics is a novel twist on multi-stream architectures.\n\n3. Empirical Evidence and Practical Impact:\n According to the abstract, experiments validate that the greater flexibility of this method leads to higher accuracy. Moreover, the method’s ability to handle an arbitrary number of domains simultaneously speaks to its scalability and practical relevance. If the experimental setup includes comparisons to relevant state-of-the-art methods—and demonstrates consistent improvements—the practical impact of the work would be high.\n\n4. Scope and Positioning relative to the Field:\n Domain adaptation is an active area of research with many efforts striving to overcome the limitations of one-size-fits-all approaches. By tailoring the operation sequence per domain, the paper not only contributes a novel architectural idea but also pushes the envelope in handling complex real-world scenarios. This can be seen as an important step forward for top-tier venues that value innovations that bridge theoretical insight with practical performance gains.\n\n5. Considerations and Open Questions:\n Although the abstract does not provide detailed insights into the architectural design (e.g., how the branch selection process is performed, how training stability is ensured, or the exact ablation studies performed), it is reasonable to assume that the full paper provides the necessary experimental validation and analysis. For acceptance at a top-tier conference, clarity in implementation details, rigorous ablation studies, and comprehensive comparisons against robust baselines are key.

Contribution and Novelty:\n • The paper provides a novel theoretical guarantee for a specific, yet important, case: training Wasserstein GANs using SGD-ascent when the generator is a one‐layer network.\n • The fact that the authors show convergence to a global solution in polynomial time with polynomial sample complexity is a strong result. Even though one‐layer networks are a simplified setting, rigorous analysis of GAN optimization is notoriously challenging.\n • By establishing such a convergence guarantee for a min‐max problem, the paper contributes to our theoretical understanding of GAN training dynamics.

Relevance to Top-Tier Conference Standards:\n • Top-tier conferences highly value theoretical advances that address long-standing problems such as the nonconvex‐nonconcave structure in GAN training.\n • Although the study is restricted to one-layer networks, the clarity and rigor of the theoretical analysis justify its relevance. The result advances our baseline understanding of training adversarial networks under more controlled conditions.\n • The framework and techniques introduced might also provide insights or tools that can be generalized to broader settings.\n\n3. Potential Limitations:\n • One could argue that the restriction to one-layer generators may limit immediate applicability to real-world cases. However, theoretical research often begins in simplified settings to pinpoint key challenges before extending results to more complex models.\n • The paper’s assumptions and techniques need to be scrutinized, but the abstract indicates solid results regarding convergence rates and sample efficiency.\n\nIn summary, despite its focus on a one-layer network, the paper makes a compelling theoretical contribution toward understanding GAN training dynamics under a Wasserstein formulation.

      "response": "Below is my detailed reasoning:\n\n1. Novelty and Contribution:\n The paper introduces two new regularizers designed to force the convex relaxation solution to be closer to feasibility with respect to the original non-relaxed problem. This approach is novel because it explicitly attacks the commonly observed gap between the certifiable (convex-relaxation based) robustness and the empirical (PGD-based) robustness. In settings where certifiability is paramount, this method of “tightening” the certification bounds appears to be a smart and originally motivated idea.\n\n2. Significance:\n Certifiably robust models are a major concern in defense against adversarial attacks. Improvements in certification bounds are critical, as they raise confidence in model robustness. The paper’s focus on reducing the gap through tailored regularizers has significance from both a theoretical and practical perspective. Hence, the research addresses an important open problem in robust deep learning.\n\n3. Technical Quality and Evaluation:\n The experiments, as noted in the abstract, show that the proposed regularizations consistently yield tighter certification bounds than non-regularized baselines. While the abstract does not detail the full experimental setup, if substantiated in the paper with rigorous evaluation and comparisons, this improvement across all experiments adds weight to the contribution. Additionally, the underlying derivation that connects convex relaxation feasibility with robust certification suggests a thoughtful approach.\n\n4. Overall Assessment for a Top-Tier Conference:\n For a top-tier conference, contributions are expected to be both technically solid and of interest to the broader community. Improving the tightness of convex relaxations can have a lasting impact on research dealing with certified robustness—a topic of active interest. There is a clear and targeted advance in methodology, backed by experimental improvements. The paper seems to offer a compelling mix of theory and practice that fits well the standards of a prestigious venue.\n\nBased on the novelty of the regularization approach, its relevance to the problem of certified robustness, and the apparent empirical improvements over baseline methods, I recommend acceptance.\n\nFinal Decision: Accept"

Problem Significance: The paper addresses an important challenge in multi-task learning—namely, how to transfer knowledge when task relationships are not pre‐established. This question is central to many real-world applications where holding tasks fixed or already known to be related is a restrictive assumption. So, the paper tackles a problem of evident significance.\n\n2. Novelty and Proposed Approach: The proposed idea of using an attention-based mechanism to model multi-level task dependency is interesting and appears to add nuance beyond simply assuming tasks are related. However, the description as given in the abstract remains fairly high-level and reminiscent of existing work on attention mechanisms in multi-task or transfer learning. Without further exposition of what constitutes the “multi-level” dependency modeling and how it is fundamentally different from existing approaches using attention or learned task weighting, the novelty claim becomes less compelling for a top-tier venue.\n\n3. Methodological Detail: As described, the methodology is vague. The abstract talks about constructing attention-based dependency relationships and then using that to guide knowledge transfer, but it does not clarify key details such as: How exactly are different levels defined and detected? How are dependencies quantitatively incorporated into the transfer process? What theoretical or algorithmic advances justify that such a mechanism leads to “significant improvements”? A top-tier conference expects a clear, rigorous demonstration of novelty and method sophistication.\n\n4. Empirical Evaluation: The paper claims significant improvements over current methods on several public datasets. However, there is no information on which datasets were used, how the experiments were designed, or whether appropriate ablation studies were performed to attribute gains to the proposed mechanism. This lack of experimental detail makes it difficult to assess the rigor and reproducibility of the results.\n\n5. Overall Assessment: While the research direction is promising and the problem significant, the paper does not provide sufficient methodological novelty or detailed experimental validation, based on the abstract alone. For a top-tier conference, the contribution should be thoroughly substantiated both in the conceptual innovation and in the experimental analysis. The current description does not convince that these benchmarks have been met.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

By exploring a trio of complementary strategies—(1) demonstrating that only 2% of supervised updates are sufficient to achieve ~80% of the full brain match, (2) achieving 54% of the brain match “at birth” via improved random synaptic connectivity, and (3) showing that training a sparse subset (~5%) of synapses can maintain nearly 80% performance—the authors make a significant contribution. \n\nThe work is well motivated from both computational neuroscience and machine learning perspectives.

Experimental Validation and Evaluation:\n • The abstract does not provide quantitative results or comparisons to current state‐of‐the‐art methods.

Contribution and Novelty:\n The paper introduces a generalized probability kernel (GPK) defined on discrete distributions with finite support—a natural generalization of standard discrepancy statistics such as the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) and probability product kernels. The idea of constructing a kernel directly between entire distributions (rather than samples) is an interesting twist that may bridge the gap between distribution-property estimation and kernel-based hypothesis testing. In addition, the proposed “power-MMD” extends MMD within this framework for application in two‐sample testing. These contributions seem to be nontrivial and potentially of interest to the research community, especially if the new formulation leads to improved performance or theoretical insight.\n \n2. Theoretical Analysis:\n The paper promises both a bias analysis and convergence bounds for the estimators computed via empirical frequencies. The rigorous treatment of estimation errors within the context of the generalized setting is an attractive theoretical aspect that adds depth to the contribution. Understanding these properties is crucial for kernel-based methods, and the paper appears to tackle these issues head on.\n\n3. Applications and Impact:\n Two-sample testing is a central problem in statistics and machine learning. Leveraging a generalized kernel framework in such tests—and proposing power-MMD—might offer advantages in detecting subtle distributional differences when compared to conventional MMD. If the paper provides convincing theoretical guarantees as well as empirical evaluations (or at least a clear strategy for analyzing performance), then the work would likely be influential in further bridging theoretical and applied aspects of hypothesis testing.\n\n4.

Assuming that the full manuscript contains detailed proofs, comprehensive experiments, and comparisons to existing methods, the paper will be valuable to the community.\n\n5.

Novelty and Motivation: The paper identifies a genuine shortcoming in current imitation plus reinforcement learning methods – the data inefficiency when adapting to new tasks even with demonstrations. By leveraging meta reinforcement learning and conditioning exploration through dual inference strategies, the authors aim to bridge this gap. This combination, especially in the form of “Probabilistic Embeddings” to precondition exploration, signals a novel way to blend meta-learning with imitation learning.\n\n2. Technical Contributions: The key idea of preconditioning exploration policies with demonstrations alongside a probabilistic embedding of task dynamics is attractive. This design promises robustness because it lets the agent both follow the demonstrated behavior and adaptively explore in altered or uncertain environments. The approach’s ability to interpolate between previously encountered dynamics and unseen tasks (or even task families) speaks to potential for significant contributions to the meta-RL field.\n\n3.

By mapping the classical forward and inverse models of the cerebellum to solutions for forward and backward locking problems in deep learning, the work forms an intriguing bridge between neuroscience and machine learning. Such a proposal can have far‐reaching implications, as it not only provides a conceptual advance regarding the credit assignment problem in neural systems but also suggests new ways of designing more efficient deep learning architectures.\n\n2. Theoretical Insight and Biological Plausibility: The authors make a compelling argument that cerebellar networks can be seen as decoupling devices that facilitate efficient credit assignment in large-scale recurrent neural networks. This reinterpretation resonates with both computational and systems neuroscience, as it links well-known biological models with state-of-the-art algorithmic challenges. The extension to sparse connectivity – reflecting biological realities and simultaneously reducing model complexity – further strengthens the paper’s claims.\n\n3. Empirical Evaluation: The paper supports its framework with modeling experiments spanning both sensorimotor (target reaching, sequential MNIST) and cognitive tasks (caption generation).

For a top-tier conference, such interdisciplinary work is not only acceptable but highly desirable.\n\n5. Limitations: While some questions remain regarding the depth of experimental validation and potential oversimplifications in mapping the precise biological mechanisms, the paper sufficiently justifies its approach with both theoretical reasoning and empirical tests. The new neuroscience predictions put forward also provide avenues for future experimental verification, increasing the work’s long‐term impact.\n\nFinal Decision: Accept"

While the idea of reducing network size without significantly altering the learned function is appealing, several concerns arise when evaluating the paper against top-tier conference standards:\n\n1. Novelty and Contribution: The idea of network pruning and compression is a well-explored topic. The proposed approach appears to be built on existing regularization theory without a clear demonstration of substantially novel insights beyond what has already been studied. The reliance on previous theoretical work makes it hard to differentiate the reduction algorithm as a significant breakthrough.\n\n2. Theoretical and Experimental Rigor: The abstract only mentions two experiments that illustrate the efficiency of the algorithm. This limited experimental validation is unlikely to satisfy the high standards expected at a top-tier conference, where thorough empirical evaluation on diverse and challenging benchmarks is expected. Moreover, the theoretical analysis is not elaborated upon in the abstract, and it is unclear if the proofs and arguments provided in the paper are sufficiently robust.\n\n3. Scope and Impact: While reducing the number of neurons with minimal (provably almost no) change in function is practically useful, the paper does not clearly state if this leads to improvements in generalization or if it can be broadly applied to networks beyond the tested scenarios. The discussion of “almost no change within the training data” raises concerns about whether the approach truly generalizes or only preserves performance on seen data.\n\n4. Clarity and Rigor: The presentation, as inferred from the abstract, is relatively brief and does not provide enough detail on the methodology, the nature of the experiments, or the statistical significance of results to convince a skeptical top-tier audience.\n\nIn summary, while the objective of the paper is relevant, its contribution appears incremental, and the experimental validation as well as the theoretical exposition seem insufficiently developed to merit acceptance at a top-tier conference.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

This approach is compelling because it captures the benefits of ensembling—namely, enhanced robustness, improved accuracy, better-calibrated predictions, and lower negative log-likelihood—while incurring essentially no additional inference cost. Ensemble methods are known to produce robust predictions, but they typically require multiple forward passes, making them computationally expensive. The proposed method bypasses that limitation by effectively “extracting” an ensemble from a single forward pass.\n\nThe technical contribution is noteworthy as it moves beyond traditional ensembling by enabling efficient and robust prediction, and the empirical evaluation covers prominent benchmarks (CIFAR10, CIFAR100, ImageNet) as well as their out-of-distribution variants. The extensive experimentation and the reported improvements in multiple relevant metrics (accuracy, calibration error, negative log-likelihood) suggest that the method has both theoretical and practical significance.\n\nFrom a top-tier conference perspective, the strengths include the novelty of integrating multiple subnetworks into one forward pass, the impact on robustness without sacrificing computational efficiency, and the comprehensive evaluation on standard and challenging datasets. While there might be concerns about whether the independent subnetworks truly capture diversity similar to traditional ensembles, the experimental results seem to address these issues effectively.\n\nThus, in light of the novelty, potential impact, and strong experimental evaluation, the paper meets the standards expected for a top-tier venue.\n\nFinal Decision: Accept"

Novelty and Conceptual Contribution:\n• The paper proposes a novel approach to disentangle representations by learning binary masks over transformer weights or hidden units. This idea of “disentanglement via masking” is an interesting twist on current disentanglement methods that rely on training separate or variational autoencoder-based models.\n• By leveraging pre-trained transformers like BERT and coupling it with magnitude pruning, the method sidesteps the need to design and train specialized models from scratch, potentially offering wider applicability.\n\n2. Technical Soundness and Methodology:\n• The approach of identifying subnetworks that correspond to distinct factors (e.g., syntax vs. semantics or sentiment vs. genre) is a clever mechanism to interpret and extract distributed features.\n• Combining the mask-learning approach with magnitude pruning is technically appealing and offers a concrete mechanism for controlling model sparsity, which is desirable for interpretability and potentially computational efficiency.\n• The paper states that the method performs as well as or better than previous approaches based on variational autoencoders and adversarial training. This direct empirical comparison suggests a well-thought experimental design (pending more detailed methodological explanations and a reproducibility aspect in the full paper).\n\n3. Experiments and Evaluation:\n• The evaluation includes multiple factors of variation – using both linguistic properties (syntax and semantics) and socio-emotional characteristics (sentiment vs. genre). This breadth supports claims of general applicability.\n• Demonstrating that the method can yield “quite sparse subnetworks” is a strong point, as sparsity is relevant to both efficiency and interpretability.\n• The abstract indicates competitive or superior performance relative to strong baselines. Assuming that the empirical evaluations are rigorous (with appropriate metrics and baselines), this strengthens the paper’s contributions.\n\n4. Impact and Relevance:\n• Disentanglement in representations is of high interest in deep learning, interpretability, and natural language processing. By showing that a simple masking strategy applied to established transformer models can reveal distinct latent factors, the paper contributes both methodologically and practically.\n• The potential for simplifying model design (avoiding training disentangled models from scratch) has clear implications for research and applications in NLP.\n\n5. Potential Weaknesses and Considerations:\n• While the abstract is promising, further details (for instance, on the exact masking algorithm, training procedures, evaluation metrics, and dataset splits) would be required to fully assess reproducibility and robustness. However, given the standards of a top-tier conference, this concern can typically be addressed in the full paper.\n• A clear comparison and ablation study against the most recent strong baselines will be necessary, but the abstract indicates that such comparisons exist.\n\nConclusion:\nBased on the strength of the proposed method, its potential impact in representation learning and interpretability, and the competitive performance cited in the abstract, the paper seems promising for acceptance at a top-tier conference.

Relevance and Significance:\n • Unsupervised learning for 3D scene decomposition is a challenging and valuable task for the broader community. Object decomposition is pivotal for tasks like scene understanding and 3D detection.\n • The fully unsupervised nature of the proposal, coupled with hierarchical representation, could have wide implications for future research and applications in modeling complex scenes in domains ranging from robotics to AR/VR.\n\n3.

The experiments demonstrate the model’s ability to disentangle different objects, compose scenes, and generalize compared with the baseline GQN.\n • The claim of achieving hierarchical object-oriented representation “without performance degradation” is especially appealing, as ensuring that such additional structure does not harm performance is a common concern in advanced generative models.\n • While more details would be necessary to fully assess scalability and robustness (for example in realistic, cluttered real-world scenes), the experimental focus on compositionality and generalization is relevant to top-tier research.\n\n4.

Originality and Contribution:\n The paper proposes a new minifloat format—Block Minifloat (BM)—that leverages an extra degree of freedom, namely using the exponent bias as an additional optimization parameter. This idea of exposing the exponent bias to reduce exponent bits is nontrivial and represents a novel approach to building narrow floating-point representations. The potential benefits for deep neural network training efficiency are significant.\n\n2. Technical Merit:\n The BM format is shown to enable training with only 4–8 bit representations for weights, activations, and gradients. The design facilitates integer-like FMA units that, according to the provided results, are far smaller and more energy efficient compared to FP8 (and even compared to FP32). The reported trade-off—almost no degradation in accuracy for a 6-bit BM representation on standard benchmarks (ResNet on ImageNet) alongside dramatic gains in size and energy efficiency—is technically impressive and well-motivated.\n\n3. Experimental Evaluation:\n The paper presents empirical evidence on a recognized benchmark (ResNet trained on ImageNet), demonstrating that the BM formats can achieve near-floating-point accuracy. The claims regarding hardware efficiency (with specific factors of 4.1×–23.9× reduction in area and 2.3×–16.1× reduction in energy) are compelling in the context of specialized deep learning accelerators. While additional experiments on a broader range of models might further strengthen the work, the experiments provided are of sufficient quality and relevance for a top-tier conference.\n\n4. Impact:\n Improving training efficiency with low-bit formats is a topic of high relevance to both the machine learning and computer architecture communities. The BM approach, if adopted, could make training of large-scale deep neural networks more power efficient and cost-effective. The potential impact on hardware design and training time reductions makes this contribution highly relevant and timely.\n\n5. Alignment with Top-Tier Conference Standards:\n The novelty, technical execution, and experimental validation of the BM strategy align well with the standards expected at a top-tier venue. The paper provides a solid theoretical basis and motivates its design decisions via empirical results. The efficiency gains and the re-thinking of the floating-point representation in a hardware-conscious manner demonstrate a strong contribution that is both technically innovative and practically significant.\n\nConclusion:\nBased on the above reasoning, I find that the paper makes substantive contributions with a novel approach that has strong empirical support and significant implications for efficient DNN training.

Contribution and Novelty: The paper proposes a framework for automatic music accompaniment by converting audio into Mel-spectrograms and then applying CycleGAN, an unpaired image-to-image translation method, to generate arrangements (for example, producing drum tracks from bass lines or creating full arrangements from acapella tracks). While recasting audio as images is an approach seen before, applying CycleGANs for automatic arrangement specifically in the Mel-frequency domain is a twist that merits attention. However, the novelty appears somewhat incremental since both the use of GANs for generative tasks and the spectrogram-based representation of audio are well-studied areas. Without clear evidence of substantially new modeling techniques beyond reinterpreting established methods, the paper’s technical contribution may be seen as limited from a top-tier perspective.\n\n2. Methodology and Technical Rigor: The idea of framing music arrangement as an unpaired image-to-image translation task is interesting, yet the abstract does not provide sufficient details on how the challenges specific to the audio domain (e.g., preserving temporal coherence, handling phase information) are addressed. It is unclear whether the adaptation of CycleGAN to this problem included significant technical modifications or just a straightforward application. Top-tier conferences generally look for strong technical insight, and the paper might not meet that bar if it merely recycles existing methods without substantial innovations tailored to the domain.\n\n3. Evaluation and Experimental Evidence: The authors consider two downstream tasks and propose a metric—that involves human (and expert) judgment—to evaluate the output. While subjective evaluation is common in generative music tasks due to the lack of fully objective metrics, relying on partially subjective metrics can be a weakness if not thoroughly validated. Furthermore, it is not clear how comprehensive the experiments are, whether they include comparisons to strong baselines, or if there are ablation studies to support the design choices. For a top-tier venue, a more rigorous and varied evaluation would be expected.\n\n4. Overall Impact: Although the idea of using CycleGAN on Mel-spectrogram representations for music production is appealing, the paper appears to be more of an application paper than one providing strong theoretical or methodological innovations. In the context of a top-tier conference, papers are expected to push the state-of-the-art in techniques, provide deeper insights, or solve notoriously difficult problems with significant novelty. Given the incremental nature of the proposed approach and the limited details provided on experimental work and technical improvements, the overall impact may be considered insufficient for acceptance at the highest level.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

A top-tier paper is expected to deliver significant theoretical insights or new methodologies, and based on the abstract, it is not clear that sufficient novelty or in‐depth theoretical contribution is provided.\n\n2.

Novelty:\nThe proposed method, αVIL, introduces a mechanism that directly leverages the model’s parameter updates between training epochs to estimate task importance dynamically.

The experimental results on large-scale datasets further support the relevance and utility of the approach.\n\n5. Overall Impact:\n Combining a theoretically sound mechanism with strong experimental evidence, the paper provides a method that significantly advances the state-of-the-art in extreme classification. The potential to reduce training time dramatically while maintaining scalability makes it an attractive approach for applications in a number of high-impact fields (technology, science, e-commerce, etc.).\n\nWhile as a reviewer I would like to see more detailed discussion regarding potential stability issues with the adversarial mechanism and discussions on any additional hyperparameter tuning required, the overall contributions and findings are strong enough to suggest that these concerns do not detract from the paper’s novelty or impact.\n\nFinal Decision: Accept"

Theoretical Rigor and Technical Approach:\n • The authors address non-trivial challenges such as the non-convexity of the value function over policy space by employing a non-convex variant of the Frank-Wolfe method together with recent advances in gradient boosting.

Proposed Approach and Novelty:\n • The paper proposes a post hoc calibration method using outlier exposure that reportedly “significantly improves” on benchmark results reported in [Ovadia et al 2019].

Without clear evidence (or theoretical justification) of substantial novelty beyond adapting existing ideas to this setting, the contribution may not meet the innovation threshold expected at a top-tier conference.\n\n3. Experimental Evaluation:\n • The abstract claims significant improvements on a wide range of corrupted data benchmarks. While strong empirical results are encouraging, the abstract does not provide sufficient details on experimental design, baselines, or ablation studies that would be required for confidence in a top-tier conference paper.\n • Since the contribution is largely demonstrated via empirical improvement relative to a benchmark, the work would need a very strong empirical design and comprehensive analysis to compensate for limited algorithmic novelty.

This is a noteworthy technical novelty, as it reinforces and extends earlier findings by Valle-Pérez et al.

This is a significant contribution given the long-standing challenges associated with non-convex optimization in neural network training.\n\n2. Theoretical Impact: By revealing a hidden convexity underlying the training loss, the paper offers a novel theoretical lens to understand properties such as the absence of spurious valleys and the behavior of stochastic gradient descent in finding global optima (via Clarke stationary points). The derivation of a polynomial-time algorithm to check whether a given neural network is a global minimum is particularly compelling because it addresses a long-standing open problem in non-convex optimization for neural networks.\n\n3. Clarity and Framework: The abstract presents a structured and rich framework for studying the landscape of neural network training loss. The paper not only characterizes the entire set of optimal solutions but also connects these theoretical insights with practical consequences such as constructing continuous paths from arbitrary points to the global optimum, which could be influential for understanding optimization dynamics.\n\n4.

Empirical Evaluation:\n• Recognizing the limitation of the theory, the authors supplement their analysis with experimental results. They verify that resonant phenomena can occur in more general settings, such as non-periodic covariate shift, nonlinear neural network dynamics, and even with optimizers beyond SGDm.\n• This empirical reinforcement helps to mitigate concerns regarding the restricted scope of the theoretical result, lending credibility to the overall contributions of the paper.\n\n4.

First, they analyze how classical TD learning and FVI converge to fixed points that differ from those reached by residual minimization (RM) in the overparameterized linear case. This theoretical insight is important because it recontextualizes how overparameterization impacts learning dynamics in reinforcement learning. By developing a unified interpretation that recasts value estimation as minimizing the Euclidean norm of weights under different constraints, the paper not only advances theoretical understanding but also paves the way for practical algorithmic improvements.\n\nThe modification to RM—altering the backup targets to obtain the same fixed points as FVI and TD while ensuring universal stability—is a significant and practically relevant contribution. It bridges the gap between theory and practice by ensuring algorithmic stability, a central concern in deep RL. The authors further bolster their theoretical contributions by providing per-iterate and fixed point generalization error bounds, thus adding rigorous performance guarantees.\n\nAdditionally, and importantly for a top-tier conference, the paper does not stop at theory. It extracts two regularizers designed to penalize out-of-span top-layer weights and co-linearity in top-layer features. The empirical results demonstrate that these regularizers improve the stability of standard methods (TD and FVI) while allowing RM to match or exceed their performance.

Moreover, the scaling property could be a key advantage when applying meta‐learning to large‐scale problems.\n\nSome potential concerns, however, warrant a closer look. One must ensure that the experimental evaluation is thorough and that the empirical evidence supports the claim that the meta‐learner is truly “learning” the update rules and not merely relying on feature re‐use. In addition, while LSTM‐based optimizers have seen prior use, the paper must clearly articulate how NORML’s design differs from related approaches (for example, past work on learning optimizers) to avoid the perception of incremental novelty. Assuming the full paper addresses these issues—providing detailed experimental setups, results on challenging tasks, and clear comparisons with competitive baselines—the work stands as an original and significant contribution appropriate for a top‐tier conference.\n\nGiven the potential impact and the interesting approach presented, I recommend acceptance.\n\nFinal Decision: Accept"

Instead of relying solely on localized feature aggregation, it proposes a GNN model that integrates a global self-attention mechanism built on learnable spectral filters. This enables the model to capture relationships between nodes across varied distances, making it naturally suited to handle both assortative (homophilic) and disassortative graphs.\n\nFrom a methodological perspective, the idea of employing adaptive spectral filters to design a global attention mechanism is both innovative and timely.

The approach is theoretically motivated and the analysis centers on how the weighted mean can be used to tighten bounds on the deviation of the loss from the true expectation, potentially improving robustness. While the paper provides proofs relating the weighted mean minimization to higher-order moment optimization, the overall contribution appears to be more of an alternate formulation rather than a demonstrably superior method.\n\nKey points of concern include the following:\n1. Although the theoretical angle is interesting, the paper’s experimental results indicate that the proposed method exhibits similar performance to other specialized robust loss functions. There is no clear empirical advantage or significant performance gain over existing approaches.\n2. The need to preserve convexity sometimes comes at the cost of efficiency, and the paper does not sufficiently demonstrate that the trade-offs made in its approach are beneficial in real-world scenarios compared to the state-of-the-art.\n3.

Novelty of Approach: MILAN leverages pointwise mutual information to match natural language strings with the image regions that activate particular neurons. This represents a creative departure from traditional methods that label neurons with a fixed set of concepts, enabling more expressive descriptions that capture categorical, relational, and logical structure.\n\n2. Comprehensive Evaluation: The paper demonstrates that the descriptions generated by MILAN achieve high human agreement across a range of architectures and tasks, suggesting that the method is robust and broadly applicable. The application of MILAN in analysis, auditing, and editing contexts further underscores its potential impact in understanding and controlling deep visual models.\n\n3.

Novelty and Motivation: The paper introduces a benchmark to test “compositional learning behaviours” within the context of meta-referential games. In principle, this is an interesting and timely idea since compositionality is a key challenge in language grounding and few-shot learning. However, the paper’s abstract does not clearly articulate what exactly is “meta-referential” about the games or how this approach goes beyond existing benchmarks. For top‐tier conferences, innovations must be clearly delineated relative to prior work, and the contribution here appears somewhat incremental unless more depth is provided.\n\n2. Technical Depth and Experimental Evaluation: The submission provides baseline results on single-agent tasks with state-of-the-art reinforcement learning agents. However, the evaluation seems limited since it does not extend to multi-agent interactions or detailed analyses of the benchmark’s performance characteristics. A top-tier paper would ideally include a rigorous evaluation, more extensive experiments, and analyses to demonstrate that the benchmark can reliably spur development of agents with genuine compositional generalisation abilities.\n\n3. Clarity of Contribution and Impact: While the paper intends to spur research in compositional learning, the abstract is more descriptive than compelling. It does not yet provide sufficient evidence that the benchmark challenges current methodologies in a way that will lead to significant advances. For acceptance at a top-tier conference, the work should clearly show both the limitations of existing methods and how the proposed benchmark points in a new research direction. This aspect is not fully convincing based on the information provided.\n\n4. Overall Assessment: The idea of a new benchmark in the area of language grounding and compositionality is of potential interest to the community. Nonetheless, as described, the paper appears to fall short on several important criteria for a top-tier conference paper: it does not provide a sufficiently detailed or convincing demonstration of the novelty and impact of the benchmark, nor does it offer a thorough experimental validation beyond preliminary baseline results.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

This new strategy, if substantiated by empirical evidence, represents a meaningful contribution to the field.\n• The modularity of the framework is a plus, as it enables researchers to plug in and compare new MOBO algorithms.

Moreover, by studying incremental learning phenomena and identifying the “implicit anti-regularization” effect in shallow linear networks, the authors highlight a nontrivial issue with the FA algorithm; that is, the risk of learning negligible components before the principal ones.\n\nThe investigation into initialization schemes that lead to learning in decreasing order of importance further adds to the impact of the paper.

Novel Theoretical Contribution – The paper introduces a rigorous theorem showing that the approximation error between two ReLU networks (with one hidden layer) is controlled by the Hausdorff distance between their corresponding tropical zonotopes. This connection between tropical geometry and neural network behavior appears novel and provides a fresh perspective on the underlying geometry of network approximation. Even if the theoretical result is confined to networks with one hidden layer, it represents an important step toward a geometrical interpretation of network compression.\n\n2. Algorithmic Innovation – Building on the theoretical contribution, the authors propose new geometrical compression methods that use the K-means algorithm for compressing the fully-connected parts of deep networks. Although K-means itself is a standard clustering algorithm, its integration with tropical geometrical tools to perform network compression is innovative and helps bridge two areas that have not been widely interconnected.\n\n3. Theoretical and Empirical Error Analysis – The paper provides theoretical error bounds based on their approximation theorem. This theoretical grounding is attractive for a top-tier venue. Moreover, while the empirical evaluation is described as “proof-of-concept,” the experiments indicate that the proposed methods yield improved performance compared to existing tropical geometry techniques and competitive results when compared to non-tropical methods. This dual approach of offering both theoretical insights and empirical validation, even at an early level, strengthens the overall contribution.\n\n4. Potential Limitations – There are some aspects that could be further improved:\n   - The primary theoretical result is presently limited to one-hidden-layer networks. Although the discussion and experiments extend to deep networks, a clearer pathway for generalizing the theoretical claims would have added value.\n   - The experimental evaluation is proof-of-concept in nature. For a fully mature top-tier submission, one might expect more extensive tests across benchmarks and ablation studies to comprehensively evaluate robustness.\n   - The reliance on a standard algorithm like K-means, while effective in this context, may raise questions about whether additional novel algorithmic elements could further enhance the contribution.\n\n5. Overall Assessment – For a top-tier conference, the combination of a novel theoretical insight (the interplay between tropical zonotopes and ReLU network approximation) with a practical (if initial) compression method represents significant merit. Despite some limitations in scope and empirical depth, the paper clearly pushes forward the frontiers of our understanding of neural network geometry and approximation.

While the details are not provided in the abstract, the reference to a thorough empirical study supports the claim that the approach is not only theoretically motivated but also practically effective.\n• The improvement in ensemble calibration by incorporating post-compensation, especially when applied to other diversity-inducing techniques, is an important experimental contribution and suggests broader impact.\n\n4. Relevance to Top-Tier Conferences:\n• The problem of knowledge distillation and ensemble learning is central to current advances in deep learning, and the idea of online KD without the need for a pre-trained teacher is of significant interest.\n• The paper’s focus on both performance and calibration aligns well with recent trends in research that prioritize reliable and interpretable machine learning models.\n\n5.

The paper describes not only the performance gains but also offers an analysis of the activation distributions (namely asymmetric saturation and sparsity) that underpin these improvements. This insight is unexpected since saturation is typically considered harmful. While the idea of swapping BN and activation layers may seem like a minor change, the authors show that for bounded activations, this modification has profound effects, providing both empirical evidence and hypothesis-driven experimental analysis.\n\nOne strength is that the authors extend their experiments across multiple benchmarks and variants of bounded activation functions (Tanh, LeLecun Tanh, Softsign), suggesting the phenomenon is robust. Although the paper might not present a fully rigorous theoretical framework, its empirical contributions are significant and touch on a key aspect of neural network design. The explanation of why asymmetric saturation (normally an undesirable artifact) can actually be beneficial in this case is well motivated and could prompt further research. \n\nGiven that the results run counter to conventional wisdom, the work has the potential for high impact, especially in applications where bounded activations are used.

Novelty and Technical Contribution:\n • The idea of combining Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with Transformers for offline reinforcement learning is interesting and draws on recent trends of treating RL as a sequence modeling problem. However, the contribution appears incremental because previous literature shows multiple ways of integrating search (e.g., MCTS) with learned models, such as in AlphaZero-style approaches. More importantly, the paper does not sufficiently clarify what special advantages or novel algorithmic innovations are introduced in the MCTransformer framework compared to existing integrated methods.\n\n2. Clarity and Methodological Rigor:\n • While the abstract outlines an actor–critic setup where MCTS navigates explored states and the Transformer guides exploration, the description is rather high level. Without clarity on the technical details (e.g., how the actor–critic integration is performed, specifics of the Transformer architecture, or modifications to typical MCTS procedures in an offline setting), it is difficult to gauge how robust or reproducible the method is.\n • There is lacking discussion about potential limitations or challenges inherent to merging these techniques.\n\n3. Empirical Evaluation:\n • The evaluation is reported on SameGame, a recognized challenge; however, assessing performance only on a single domain can limit the evidence for generalizability and robustness—especially for a top-tier conference.  \n • The claim that MCTransformer outperforms both Transformer-based and MCTS-based solutions is interesting, but without extensive comparisons across a broader range of tasks (or with standard baselines in offline RL) it is hard to fully validate the significance of the results.\n\n4. Overall Impact and Presentation:\n • The integration of Transformers and MCTS for offline RL is a promising avenue, yet the presented work does not convince that it achieves a substantial enough improvement in either performance or efficiency to warrant publication at a top-tier venue.\n • More comprehensive experimental studies, clearer exposition of the algorithmic contributions, and an in-depth analysis showing its advantages over closely related methods are needed.\n\nFor these reasons, the paper, in its current state, does not meet the rigorous standards expected for a top-tier conference publication.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

Although the common practice places BN before the activation function, the paper provides substantial evidence that, for bounded activations, relocating BN after the activation function results in considerable performance improvements. The authors rigorously analyze the phenomenon—highlighting the emergence of extreme and asymmetrical saturation—and show that this, in turn, leads to a relocation near zero and higher sparsity, which contributes to better performance. \n\nThe work is notable for several reasons:\n1. Novel Insight: The observation that the BN-activation swap, while indifferent in the context of ReLU activations, yields significant benefits for bounded activations is counterintuitive and challenges established best practices.\n2. Detailed Empirical Analysis: The paper claims extensive experimental validation across various benchmarks, architectures, and with multiple bounded activation functions (Tanh, LeLecun Tanh, and Softsign). This empirical backing is crucial for convincing the community of the practical relevance of the findings.\n3.

The authors propose a novel scheme (PVP) that uses dense data augmentation followed by a distribution-consistent sampling algorithm to generate a “proximal set” that substitutes for a traditional validation set. This idea is innovative because it addresses the well-known trade-off between having enough data for training and maintaining a trustworthy evaluation standard—a real concern in many production environments.\n\nOne strong point of the paper is its cross-modal evaluation. By demonstrating effectiveness on images, text, and tabular data, the method shows promise in its generalizability and practical applicability. The idea of creating a “proximal set” could meaningfully reduce the technical debt incurred when a fixed, randomly-split validation set fails to fully utilize available data.\n\nAdditionally, the experimental evidence as presented in the abstract appears extensive and compelling, suggesting that PVP outperforms existing validation protocols.

Although contrastive techniques have been adapted in other parts of NLP, applying it specifically to address text degeneration in language models is a creative and timely approach.\n\n2. Technical Merit: The fusion of cross-entropy’s strengths with the idea of penalizing unlikely tokens through contrastive learning is well motivated. It appears that this formulation directly targets the relationship between the ground truth tokens and their negative alternatives, which is not addressed sufficiently in the prior unlikelihood approaches.\n\n3.

Framing the aggregation step as a meta-learning problem to learn the aggregation bias is a novel contribution that may open up further lines of inquiry.\n\n2. Methodology:\n • The formulation of the aggregator as a meta-learner that learns to calibrate and control the direction of aggregated parameters is methodologically appealing.\n • By tackling aggregation bias directly, the proposed method attempts to overcome the shortcomings of methods such as FedAvg, especially in non-iid settings. Although key details (such as the exact meta-learning formulation or the training procedure for the aggregator) are not elaborated in the abstract, the idea appears coherent and principled.\n\n3. Experimental Evaluation:\n • The paper claims that experiments show competitive performance compared with conventional baselines. This suggests that the method is at least on par with state-of-the-art approaches.\n • However, one potential concern is that “competitive performance” may not indicate a strong quantitative advance over existing methods. It will be important that the full paper provides a thorough evaluation – covering both empirical gains and any additional computational cost or complexity introduced by the meta-learning approach.\n\n4. Impact and Relevance:\n • Federated Learning is a rapidly evolving field, and improving convergence behavior under heterogeneity is an important issue. The ability to debias aggregation by learning to adapt to period drift is timely and could have a meaningful impact on FL practices.\n • Even though the improvements might be incremental compared to baseline methods, the novel perspective and methodology make it a valuable contribution at the level of a top-tier conference.\n\n5. Overall Assessment:\n • The work is well-motivated, introduces new conceptual insights (period drift), and proposes a novel methodology based on meta-learning.\n • A few potential concerns (e.g., the level of improvement over baselines and possible computational overhead) need to be addressed in the final version, but the paper overall meets the criteria expected of top-tier conference submissions through its originality and potential impact.\n\nFinal Decision: Accept"

Novelty and Relevance:\n • The paper tackles a relatively unexplored but highly relevant problem: reconstruction attacks on tabular federated learning. While most prior work has focused on image and NLP domains, many critical applications (e.g., legal/financial) use tabular data. Hence, addressing privacy leakage in this domain is both novel and practically impactful.\n • The authors outline distinctive challenges posed by tabular data—namely, mixed discrete-continuous optimization, high variance in reconstructions, and difficulty in judging reconstruction quality—which has not been adequately addressed in the current literature.\n\n2. Methodological Contributions:\n • The proposed TabLeak attack introduces three key innovations: a softmax structural prior to handle mixed data types by converting the problem into a fully continuous one, a pooled ensembling scheme to reduce reconstruction variance by leveraging data structure, and an entropy measure to assess reconstruction quality. These components together represent a methodologically interesting approach that adapts gradient inversion attacks to a new setting.\n • The techniques appear well-motivated and could have implications not only for privacy evaluation in FL but also for future defenses in the tabular domain.\n\n3. Experimental Evaluation:\n • The abstract reports that TabLeak was evaluated on four popular tabular datasets, with improvements of up to 10% on the Adult dataset compared to baselines, even in scenarios with non-trivial batch sizes. This suggests that the experimental evaluation is thorough and that the proposed method is effective.\n • Demonstrating non-trivial reconstructions for larger batch sizes further indicates the robustness of the attack, enhancing the paper’s significance.\n\n4. Impact and Applicability:\n • Since federated learning is increasingly employed in high-stakes applications, showing that tabular FL is vulnerable to effective reconstruction attacks has significant implications for the deployment of privacy-preserving techniques. The study’s findings are important for practitioners because they highlight new risks that must be mitigated.\n • The insights provided are likely to stimulate further research both in understanding vulnerabilities in FL systems and in developing countermeasures.\n\nBased on the novelty, technical contributions, and strong experimental evidence presented in the abstract, the paper meets the high standards required for a top-tier conference.\n\nFinal Decision: Accept"

Prior works have observed phase transition phenomena in these settings but only provided convergence rates without explicitly quantifying the constant thresholds. This paper fills that gap by providing precise expressions for the phase transition thresholds using a message passing algorithm—a tool that has shown promise in high-dimensional statistical inference.\n\nKey strengths of the paper include:\n1. Theoretical Contribution: It provides an exact identification of critical points (thresholds) in relation to the signal-to-noise ratio and the number of permuted rows. This is an important advancement since previous literature has left these constants unspecified.\n2. Methodological Innovation: The use of a message passing algorithm for deriving these thresholds is technically sound and appears to be a novel application in this specific problem domain.\n3. Comprehensive Analysis: The paper carefully distinguishes between the cases when the signal is known versus unknown, thereby giving a complete picture of the phase transition regimes.\n4. Empirical Validation: The theoretical predictions are backed up by numerical experiments, with results that align well with the derived thresholds.\n\nPotential Concerns:\n- While the paper is highly technical, it appears to be well executed with a clear focus on a complex issue. One might be concerned about the breadth of applications beyond the theoretical interest in phase transitions, but the precision in characterizing the thresholds can have implications for both further theoretical research and practical implementations in high-dimensional inference problems.\n- Assuming that the technical details, proofs, and experiments are presented rigorously (as suggested by the abstract and the context), there seems to be sufficient novelty and significance to warrant publication in a top-tier conference.\n\nBased on the significance of the theoretical contributions, the novelty of applying message passing in this context, and the thorough validation via experiments, the paper stands as an important contribution to the field.\n\nFinal Decision: Accept"

      "response": "Below is my detailed reasoning:\n\n1. Novel Idea and Methodology:\n • The paper proposes a novel approach to detecting out‐of‐distribution (OOD) data by representing images as networks of related features, rather than relying solely on embeddings from large pre-trained transformers. This graph‐based formulation appears to be a creative twist that has the potential to provide interpretable, high-level domain-specific concepts.\n • The integration of a human-in-the-loop design that expresses data in terms of domain-specific visual concepts represents an additional advantage over many “black-box” approaches. This interpretability benefit is well aligned with current trends in trustworthy AI.\n\n2. Performance and Empirical Validation:\n • The reported AUROC figures – 97.95% for far-OOD and 98.79% for near-OOD on the LSUN dataset – are impressive and comparable to state-of-the-art results. Although the paper claims “comparable” performance relative to existing methods, the use of a graph-based approach is interesting because it could open avenues for further improvements, more domain insight, and easier debugging.\n • The use of LSUN as a benchmark dataset is standard in the community, and achieving these levels of performance lends support to the empirical validity of the approach.\n\n3. Contributions in Context:\n • Although the numerical results are similar to currently established state-of-the-art methods, the contribution is not merely about squeezing incremental performance but rather about offering a new perspective. By leveraging topological properties and semi-supervised graph “feature” networks, the paper advances the discussion on how structural and relational information can be exploited for OOD detection.\n • The potential to facilitate human-in-the-loop strategies further distinguishes the work from alternatives that mainly deal with deep embeddings. This could be particularly valuable for application in sensitive or high-stakes environments where interpretability is paramount.\n\n4. Considerations and Trade-Offs:\n • One concern that arises is that the performance, while strong, is “comparable” to existing methods. A top-tier conference typically values robust improvements or breakthrough insights; however, the methodological novelty and the clear interpretability benefits could help motivate further investigation. \n • A full assessment would ideally examine details on scalability, computational complexity, and performance under diverse conditions beyond the LSUN dataset. These aspects will be important discussion points at the conference presentation and in future work.\n\nFinal Assessment:\nBased on the novelty of characterizing each image as a graph of features, the potential for improved interpretability via human-in-the-loop engagement, and the solid empirical results that are competitive with the state-of-the-art, I believe the paper brings sufficient novelty and quality to merit acceptance. While there might be some points that require further elaboration in the final presentation (e.g., ablation studies and additional datasets), the contributions are timely and relevant for the community.\n\nFinal Decision: Accept"

      "response": "Below is my detailed evaluation:\n\n1. Novelty and Significance:\nThe paper tackles an important limitation in neural probabilistic logic programming (NPLP) systems, namely the restriction to finite discrete domains. Extending NPLP to incorporate continuous and even uncountable domains is both novel and significant. The proposed DeepSeaProbLog language promises to bridge an important methodological gap in neuro-symbolic integration, making it of clear interest to both the neural network and symbolic reasoning communities.\n\n2. Technical Contributions:\nThe authors list three main contributions: (1) the introduction of DeepSeaProbLog and its semantics, (2) an implementation that supports both inference and gradient-based learning, and (3) an experimental evaluation. The move from discrete to continuous domains is non-trivial, and the development of proper semantics in such settings is a challenging research problem. The integrated system that supports end-to-end learning further strengthens the practical relevance of the work.\n\n3. Experimental Evaluation:\nWhile details in the abstract are limited, the inclusion of an experimental section indicates that the authors have validated the approach on relevant tasks. For a top-tier conference, experimental results that demonstrate improved performance or a broader range of application scenarios (especially in challenging continuous or infinite domains) would be crucial. If these experiments are thorough and well-conducted—as implied—the work would provide both theoretical and practical value.\n\n4. Relevance to the Field:\nNeural-symbolic integration is a rapidly growing area and one that is critical for combining the best of probabilistic reasoning and deep learning. The paper’s focus on overcoming scalability limitations in discrete domains by incorporating continuous variables is highly relevant, especially given the increasing complexity of real-world data. The proposed approach, if technically sound, has the potential to set a new direction for future research in neuro-symbolic AI.\n\n5. Overall Assessment:\nBased on the abstract and the context provided, the work appears to make substantial contributions both in theory (by defining the semantics for continuous domains) and in practice (through a complete system with learning and inference). Such a paper aligns well with the standards of a top-tier conference—presenting a clear extension of the state-of-the-art and addressing a longstanding limitation in the field.\n\nFinal Decision: Accept"

      "response": "Detailed Reasoning:\nThe paper addresses an important practical problem in deploying predictive models where both label-shift and conditional-shift occur. Its focus on online black-box adaptation is relevant given that realistic deployments often encounter multiple types of distributional changes. The motivation is clearly stated, and the paper fills a gap in the literature by addressing a setting that has received little attention (i.e., online adaptation in the presence of concurrent conditional and label shifts). The empirical evaluation across synthetic and realistic datasets (covering both classification and regression) demonstrates that accounting for conditional-shift via additional hyper-parameter tuning can lead to performance improvements.\n\nHowever, several concerns remain under the standards of a top-tier conference. First, the primary contribution appears to be an empirical observation that online methods can be improved by learning additional hyper-parameters with the help of validation sets. While this is a useful practical insight, it does not appear to introduce a fundamentally new algorithm or theoretical framework. Top-tier venues typically require either a novel method with strong theoretical guarantees or a very compelling empirical method that clearly outperforms state-of-the-art in a non-trivial way. In this case, the idea of hyper-parameter tuning to counteract conditional-shift, although beneficial, might be viewed as an incremental extension of existing work (e.g., Wu et al. 2021) rather than a breakthrough.\n\nAdditionally, the abstract does not indicate a deep theoretical analysis or any novel insights into why such hyper-parameter learning works under these combined shifts. The evaluation, while spanning multiple datasets, may be seen as lacking in a comprehensive exploration needed for demonstrating broader applicability and robustness—an aspect expected for top-tier contributions.\n\nIn summary, although the practical problem is important and the empirical results are encouraging, the contributions may not be considered sufficiently novel or theoretically deep for a top-tier conference. The work seems more suited to a strong workshop or a specialized application conference rather than a flagship venue.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"
