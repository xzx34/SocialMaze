      "response": "## Reviewer Analysis: Learning DNA folding patterns with Recurrent Neural Networks\n\nThis paper explores the use of recurrent neural networks (specifically bidirectional LSTMs) for predicting chromatin folding patterns in *Drosophila melanogaster* based on epigenetic marks. The motivation – leveraging sequential information in the genome for improved prediction – is sound, given the known relationship between epigenetic factors and 3D genome organization. The abstract highlights a key finding: RNNs outperform simpler models like linear regression and gradient boosting.\n\nHowever, several aspects raise concerns regarding suitability for a top-tier conference. The abstract is rather generic and lacks specifics. It states \"best prediction scores\" without quantifying them. What metric is being used? How much improvement does the RNN achieve over the baseline models? This lack of quantitative detail is a significant weakness. The claim of identifying \"informative epigenetic features\" also needs substantial backing – the abstract doesn’t hint at *which* features are important or how this biological significance was determined.\n\nWithout access to the full paper and reviewer comments/author responses, a definitive judgment is difficult. However, based *solely* on the provided information, the paper appears to be a potentially interesting but underdeveloped study. A top-tier conference expects novelty *and* rigorous evaluation. The abstract suggests novelty in applying RNNs to this specific problem, but the lack of quantitative results and detail regarding biological insights casts doubt on the rigor. It reads more like a proof-of-concept than a fully fleshed-out research contribution.\n\nCrucially, the abstract mentions using genomic coordinate information, which is a potentially strong point. However, it's buried within the introductory context and not emphasized as a key contribution. If the paper *effectively* integrates genomic coordinate information into the RNN architecture and demonstrates a significant benefit, that would strengthen the case for acceptance.\n\nAssuming the full paper doesn't substantially address these concerns – providing clear quantitative results, a detailed analysis of feature importance, and a compelling demonstration of the RNN's advantages – the paper is unlikely to meet the standards of a top-tier conference. It might be suitable for a workshop or a more specialized journal.\n\n\n\nFinal Deci"

      "response": "## Reviewer Analysis: Learning to Coordinate Manipulation Skills via Skill Behavior Diversification\n\nThis paper tackles the important and challenging problem of coordinating multi-arm manipulation skills, drawing inspiration from human motor control strategies. The core idea – learning diverse skill behaviors *before* coordination – is a sensible and potentially impactful approach. The experiments presented, involving tasks like bar lifting, block-in-container placement with pushing, and box pushing with ant agents, demonstrate the framework's applicability to a range of collaborative manipulation scenarios. The availability of code and videos is a significant positive, enabling reproducibility and further research.\n\nHowever, a critical evaluation reveals several areas needing improvement before this work would be suitable for a top-tier conference. While the abstract and description suggest a novel approach, the novelty isn't *strongly* articulated. Many hierarchical RL approaches decompose tasks into skills. The key contribution – skill behavior diversification – needs to be more clearly positioned within the existing literature. What specific techniques are used for diversification? How does this differ from, say, simply training multiple policies with different random seeds, or using techniques like curriculum learning or adversarial training to encourage diverse behaviors? The paper needs to explicitly address these questions.\n\nFurthermore, the experimental evaluation, while demonstrating success, lacks sufficient depth. The results are presented somewhat superficially.  A more rigorous comparison to baseline methods is crucial.  What happens if you *don't* use skill behavior diversification?  Is it truly necessary, or does coordinating randomly initialized skills work reasonably well?  Ablation studies exploring the impact of different diversification strategies would also be valuable. The choice of tasks, while illustrative, doesn't necessarily represent the most challenging scenarios for multi-arm coordination.  Tasks involving more complex object interactions or tighter timing constraints would strengthen the evaluation.  The performance metrics used are not detailed enough; reporting success rates, completion times, and potentially measures of coordination quality (e.g., smoothness of joint trajectories) would be beneficial.\n\nFinally, the paper's writing could be improved. While generally clear, it lacks the precision expected of a top-tier publication.  The connection between the motivation (human motor control) and the technical details of the framework could be more explicitly drawn.\n\n\n\nFinal Deci"

      "response": "## Reviewer Analysis: Improved Training of Certifiably Robust Models\n\nThis paper tackles an important problem in the field of robust machine learning: the gap between certified and empirical robustness. The use of convex relaxations for certifying robustness is a well-established technique, and the observation that feasibility of the relaxation is key to tightness is a valid and insightful one. The proposed approach of using regularizers to improve relaxation feasibility is a reasonable direction to explore.\n\nHowever, based *solely* on the provided information (title, abstract, and keywords), significant concerns remain regarding the paper's potential impact and suitability for a top-tier conference. The abstract is quite high-level and lacks crucial details. Specifically:\n\n* **What *are* the proposed regularizers?** The abstract states they exist and are effective, but provides absolutely no information about their form, implementation, or theoretical justification. This is a critical omission. A top-tier conference expects novelty in method *design*, not just empirical observation.\n* **How much tighter are the bounds?** Saying \"tighter\" is insufficient. Quantifying the improvement is essential. Is it a marginal improvement (e.g., 0.1% increase in certified radius) or a substantial one? The magnitude of the improvement directly impacts the significance of the work.\n* **What datasets and architectures were used?** The abstract mentions \"experiments\" but provides no context. Robustness results are highly sensitive to these choices. Without knowing the experimental setup, it's impossible to assess the generalizability of the findings.\n* **Comparison to what baselines *specifically*?** \"Non-regularized baselines\" is vague. Were these standard convex relaxation training methods? Were they state-of-the-art certified robustness techniques? A clear comparison is needed.\n* **What kind of adversarial attacks were used for empirical robustness evaluation?** While the paper focuses on *certifiable* robustness against norm-bounded attacks, it's important to understand how the models perform against standard PGD attacks.\n\nThe keywords are appropriate, but don't compensate for the lack of detail in the abstract. The paper *claims* improvement, but doesn't provide enough information to evaluate the validity or significance of that claim. A strong paper for a top-tier conference needs to clearly articulate its contribution, methodology, and results. This abstract reads more like a project proposal than a completed research paper.

The current landscape of singing voice synthesis is heavily reliant on these inputs, making this work a potentially significant departure and contribution. The exploration of three distinct generation schemes – free singer, accompanied singer, and solo singer – demonstrates a thoughtful approach to dissecting the problem and exploring different levels of control/complexity. The acknowledgement of challenges and the proposed pipeline, including source separation, transcription, GANs, and custom metrics, suggest a reasonably comprehensive methodology.\n\nHowever, a critical assessment reveals several potential weaknesses that raise concerns about its readiness for a top-tier conference. The abstract, while outlining the *what* of the work, is light on the *how well*. It states they \"tackle\" the challenges, but doesn’t hint at the degree of success. A top-tier conference demands demonstrable results, not just a proposed approach. The reliance on source separation and transcription models *for data preparation* is a potential bottleneck. The quality of these pre-processing steps will heavily influence the final output, and the paper doesn’t detail how robust these models are, or how errors in transcription/separation are handled. This is particularly crucial given the lack of ground truth lyrics/scores to fall back on.\n\nFurthermore, the abstract mentions \"customized metrics for evaluation.\" This is good, as standard audio metrics are often insufficient for perceptual quality, especially in singing voice. *However*, the paper *must* clearly articulate what these metrics are and *why* they are appropriate for this task. Without this, the evaluation is difficult to assess. The abstract doesn't give any indication of the quality of the generated singing voice. Is it intelligible? Does it sound natural? Does it exhibit musicality? These are crucial questions that need to be addressed.\n\nWithout access to the full paper and reviewer comments/author responses, it's difficult to be definitive. However, based solely on the abstract, the work *feels* more like a proof-of-concept or exploratory study than a fully-fledged contribution ready for a top-tier venue. It lays out an interesting direction, but lacks the concrete results and rigorous evaluation expected at that level. A strong paper would demonstrate compelling examples of generated singing, a thorough analysis of the limitations, and a clear justification for the chosen evaluation metrics. The current abstract doesn't convey that level of maturity.\n\n\n\nFinal Deci"

The core idea – scaling the meta-learner’s parameter count linearly with the learner’s parameters – is potentially significant, addressing a key limitation of many gradient-based meta-learning methods which struggle with larger learner networks. The abstract clearly articulates the problem (limitations of existing gradient-based methods, reliance on feature reuse), the proposed solution (NORML), and a key benefit (scalability).\n\nHowever, based *solely* on the provided information (title, abstract, and keywords), a definitive acceptance recommendation is difficult. The abstract hints at experimental validation demonstrating both feature reuse *and* the meta-learner’s ability to learn effective weight updates. This is crucial. If the experiments convincingly demonstrate the latter – that NORML genuinely learns to optimize beyond simple feature reuse – then the paper has a strong contribution. However, the abstract doesn’t provide specifics on the experimental setup, datasets used, or the magnitude of improvement observed.  A top-tier conference demands rigorous empirical evaluation.\n\nSeveral questions remain unanswered:\n\n* **Scalability Demonstration:** The abstract *claims* scalability.  Is this demonstrated with experiments on significantly larger learner networks than those typically used in meta-learning?  Simply showing it *can* scale isn't enough; it needs to show it scales *effectively* – maintaining or improving performance as learner size increases.\n* **Comparison Baseline:** What baselines are used for comparison?  Simply stating it goes beyond feature reuse isn't sufficient.  It needs to be compared against strong meta-learning baselines (e.g., MAML, Reptile, Meta-SGD) and ablation studies should be performed to isolate the contribution of the nodal optimization.\n* **Computational Cost:** While parameter scaling is linear, what is the computational cost of the neuron-wise optimization? Is it practical for real-world applications? The abstract doesn't address this.\n* **Generalization:** Does the learned optimization strategy generalize well to different task distributions?\n\n\n\nWithout access to the full paper and reviewer comments/author responses, it's impossible to assess the robustness of the methodology, the quality of the experiments, and the clarity of the presentation. The idea is promising, but the abstract alone doesn't provide enough evidence to justify acceptance to a top-tier conference.

This is a valuable goal, as the practical limitations of many existing OOD detection techniques are precisely those issues – the need for labeled OOD data or costly retraining.

The motivation is clearly stated and the problem is well-defined.\n\nHowever, several concerns prevent me from recommending acceptance to a top-tier conference *at this time*. My assessment is based solely on the provided title and abstract; a full paper review would likely reveal further strengths and weaknesses.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Practical Relevance:** The avoidance of OOD samples for validation/retraining is a significant practical advantage. This addresses a key limitation of many current OOD detection methods.\n* **Novelty (Potential):** Applying NCD to CNN feature maps for OOD detection appears to be a novel approach. The connection to global average pooling and spatial pattern extraction is a reasonable starting point.\n* **Clear Motivation:** The abstract clearly articulates the problem and the proposed solution's benefits.\n\n**Weaknesses & Concerns:**\n\n* **Lack of Detail:** The abstract is *very* high-level. It states *what* MALCOM does, but not *how* it does it in sufficient detail.  Specifically, how is the \"similarity metric\" calculated? What specific sequential patterns are extracted? How is NCD actually applied to the feature maps?  Without this, it's impossible to assess the technical soundness of the approach.\n* **NCD Justification:** While NCD is mentioned in the title, the abstract doesn't clearly explain *why* NCD is a suitable metric for this task.  What properties of NCD make it effective for identifying OOD samples based on feature map patterns?  This connection needs to be explicitly stated and justified.\n* **Evaluation is Missing:** The abstract doesn't mention any experimental results.

Specifically, it provides a positive result demonstrating that, under a significant simplification – a one-layer generator – SGD *does* converge to a global solution in polynomial time and sample complexity.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Important Question:** The paper addresses a core issue in GAN research. Understanding *why* WGANs work in practice, even if not perfectly aligned with theory, is crucial for further progress.\n* **Clear and Focused Result:** The result is stated precisely: convergence to a global solution for a one-layer generator. This focused scope allows for a rigorous analysis.\n* **Theoretical Contribution:** Providing polynomial time and sample complexity guarantees is a valuable theoretical contribution, even within the limited setting. This moves beyond purely empirical observations.\n* **Relevance to WGANs:** The work directly relates to a popular and influential GAN variant.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Strong Simplification:** The biggest limitation is the assumption of a one-layer generator. While this allows for a tractable analysis, it significantly limits the practical relevance of the result. Real-world generators are almost always multi-layered to represent complex data distributions. The paper doesn't sufficiently discuss the implications of this simplification or potential avenues for extending the results to deeper networks.  Is the core mechanism identified here likely to generalize, even partially?\n* **Limited Scope:** The result, while theoretically sound within its constraints, doesn't offer much insight into the behavior of WGANs with more complex generators. It feels like a special case rather than a general principle.\n* **Lack of Empirical Validation:** The paper focuses entirely on theoretical analysis. While strong theory is valuable, some limited empirical validation – even on simple datasets – would strengthen the claims and provide some intuition about the practical impact of the result. Showing that the theoretical bounds are reasonably tight in practice would be beneficial.\n\n\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThis paper presents a solid theoretical result, but its practical impact is questionable due to the strong simplifying assumption of a one-layer generator. While the question addressed is important, the answer, in its current form, feels incomplete. It's a good starting point for further research, but doesn't represent a breakthrough that warrants acceptance to a top-tier conference *as is*.  The paper needs to either demonstrate a path towards generalizing the results to more complex architectures or significantly expand the discussion of the limitations and potential implications of the one-layer constraint.

Is this complexity justified by the performance gains? Is there a risk of overfitting, especially with limited data in some domains?\n* **Scalability:** While claiming to handle \"any number of domains,\" the abstract doesn't address the computational cost of adding more branches.\n* **Baselines:** The abstract mentions \"state-of-the-art domain adaptation techniques\" but doesn't specify *which* techniques were used for comparison.

      "response": "## Review of \"Deep Interaction Processes for Time-Evolving Graphs\"\n\nThis paper tackles the important and increasingly relevant problem of modeling time-evolving graphs with deep learning. The abstract presents a compelling approach, framing the problem within a temporal point process and introducing several novel components: a mixture of temporal cascades, time gates, a selection mechanism, and multi-resolution fusion via attention. The application to anti-fraud detection is also a strong point, suggesting practical relevance. However, a thorough evaluation requires considering potential weaknesses and comparing the work to the state-of-the-art.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Novelty:** The combination of temporal point processes with deep learning for dynamic graphs appears novel. The proposed mixture of temporal cascades and time gates are interesting mechanisms for capturing temporal dependencies. The selection mechanism and multi-resolution attention add further sophistication.\n* **Theoretical Soundness:** Framing the problem within a temporal point process provides a principled foundation. This is a significant advantage over purely heuristic approaches.\n* **Practical Relevance:** The application to fraud detection is a strong indicator of real-world impact.  Financial applications are often a good testbed for these types of models.\n* **Inductive Capability:** The ability to handle graph growth and shrinkage is a crucial property for many real-world time-evolving graphs and a significant benefit.\n* **Comprehensive Approach:** The paper attempts to address multiple aspects of the problem – modeling node dynamics, inter-node dependencies, and varying time scales – which is commendable.\n\n**Potential Weaknesses (based on abstract alone - lacking reviewer comments & author responses):**\n\n* **Complexity:** The proposed model appears quite complex, with several interacting components. This raises concerns about computational cost, training stability, and interpretability. A top-tier conference requires not only novelty but also practical feasibility.\n* **Evaluation Rigor:** The abstract mentions \"superior performance,\" but lacks specifics.  What baselines were used? How significant are the improvements?  Are the results statistically significant?  The phrase \"illustrate the effectiveness\" is weak and needs to be backed by concrete data.\n* **Scalability:** While the inductive capability is mentioned, the abstract doesn’t address the scalability of the approach to very large graphs.  Many real-world graphs are massive, and a model that doesn't scale well is limited in its applicability.\n* **Clarity of the Selection Mechanism:** The description of the selection mechanism (\"gives important nodes large influence\") is vague.  How is \"importance\" defined and measured?  This needs to be clarified.\n\n\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe paper presents a promising approach to a challenging problem. The novelty and theoretical grounding are strong points. However, the abstract leaves several critical questions unanswered regarding the practical feasibility, scalability, and thoroughness of the evaluation. Without reviewer comments and author responses, it's difficult to assess how well the authors have addressed these concerns.  A top-tier conference demands a high level of rigor and clarity, and the abstract alone doesn't fully convince me that this paper meets those standards.  I would lean towards rejection *unless* the reviewer comments highlight significant strengths not apparent in the abstract, and the author responses demonstrate a convincing rebuttal of the potential weaknesses.\n\n\n\nFinal Deci"

      "response": "## Reviewer Analysis\n\nThis paper proposes a method for refining Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) agents *by* MCTS – a meta-search approach to improve the episode generation process within a reinforcement learning framework similar to AlphaZero. The core idea, framing the entire learning system as a game tree search, aims to better balance exploration and exploitation during episode generation, potentially addressing stability and performance concerns in existing methods.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Interesting Idea:** The concept of using MCTS to guide the episode generation process itself is novel and potentially valuable. AlphaZero relies heavily on the quality of self-play data, and improving how that data is generated is a worthwhile pursuit.\n* **Addresses a Gap:** The paper correctly identifies a weakness in current AlphaZero-like systems: a lack of theoretical understanding and guarantees regarding the learning process's stability and final performance. Focusing on the coordination of episode generation is a logical place to start addressing this.\n* **Clear Motivation:** The abstract clearly articulates the problem and the proposed solution.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Limited Scope & Evaluation:** The biggest weakness is the evaluation. Experiments are conducted on a \"small problem,\" which is not specified. This severely limits the generalizability of the findings. A top-tier conference requires rigorous evaluation on established benchmarks, even if the method isn't directly comparable to state-of-the-art on those benchmarks (in which case, a clear justification for the chosen problem is needed).  The abstract states \"robust performance compared to AlphaZero,\" but without details on the problem, the comparison is meaningless. Is it a simplified version of Go? A different game entirely? The scale of the problem is crucial.\n* **Lack of Detail:** The abstract is quite high-level. It states the method \"handles the trade-off between exploitation and exploration,\" but doesn't explain *how*.  The reviewer would need to see the technical details to assess the validity and ingenuity of the approach.\n* **AlphaZero Comparison:** Simply stating \"robust performance compared to AlphaZero\" is insufficient. AlphaZero is a complex system. The paper needs to specify *which* version of AlphaZero it's comparing against (e.g., the original paper's implementation, a specific open-source reimplementation), and *how* the performance is measured.  A fair comparison requires careful consideration of hyperparameters and computational resources.\n* **Missing Theoretical Analysis:** While the paper acknowledges the lack of theoretical guarantees in existing methods, it doesn't appear to offer substantial theoretical analysis of its own approach.  A top-tier conference would expect some level of theoretical justification for why this meta-MCTS approach should improve stability or performance.\n\n\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe idea presented in this paper is interesting and addresses a relevant problem in reinforcement learning. However, the lack of detailed technical explanation and, crucially, the extremely limited and unspecified experimental evaluation, make it unsuitable for publication in a top-tier conference. The claim of \"robust performance compared to AlphaZero\" is unsubstantiated without a clear description of the experimental setup and results. The paper feels more like a preliminary investigation or a workshop submission than a fully-fledged conference paper. More work is needed to flesh out the method, provide a rigorous evaluation on a more challenging problem, and ideally, offer some theoretical insights.\n\nFinal Deci"

The motivation is sound: reducing training time and energy consumption, particularly for large CNNs. However, while the concept is promising, the paper, as presented in the abstract, lacks sufficient detail and impact to warrant acceptance at a top-tier conference. The reported speedup (1.28x) is modest, and the abstract doesn't clearly articulate *how* MuPPET achieves this, or what makes it significantly different from existing mixed-precision techniques. The lack of keywords is also a significant oversight.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Relevant Problem:** Reducing training time for large CNNs is a crucial area of research.\n* **Novelty (Potential):** The extension of mixed-precision training to fixed-point representations is a potentially novel contribution. The dynamic precision switching is also a positive aspect.\n* **Empirical Evaluation:** The authors evaluate their method on standard datasets (ImageNet) and architectures (AlexNet, ResNet18, GoogLeNet) using a relevant hardware platform (NVIDIA Turing GPU). This is a good starting point.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Lack of Detail in Abstract:** The abstract is vague. It mentions a \"precision-switching mechanism\" but doesn't explain *how* this mechanism works. What criteria are used to switch between precisions? Is it layer-wise, parameter-wise, or something else? This is critical information.\n* **Modest Speedup:** A 1.28x speedup, while positive, is not a substantial improvement, especially considering the complexity of introducing multiple fixed-point representations. Top-tier conferences expect more significant gains. The abstract doesn't justify why this modest gain is valuable.\n* **Missing Keywords:** The absence of keywords is a serious issue. It hinders discoverability and categorization of the paper.\n* **Limited Context on Fixed-Point:** The abstract doesn't explain *why* fixed-point representations are beneficial in this context. What are the trade-offs compared to FP16/FP8?\n* **No Comparison to Fixed-Point Training Baselines:** The abstract only compares to full-precision training. It doesn't mention any comparison to existing fixed-point training methods, making it difficult to assess the contribution.\n* **Vague Claims:** Phrases like \"tailors the training process to the hardware-level capabilities\" are too vague and need to be substantiated with details.\n\n\n\n**Further Considerations (Without Reviewer Comments/Author Responses):**\n\nWithout access to the full paper, reviewer comments, and author responses, it's difficult to make a definitive judgment. However, based solely on the abstract, the paper needs significant improvements to be considered for a top-tier conference. The full paper *must* provide a detailed explanation of the precision-switching mechanism, a thorough comparison to existing methods (both floating-point and fixed-point), and a more compelling justification for the modest speedup. The authors also need to address the lack of keywords.\n\n\n\nFinal Deci"

The motivation, stemming from Telgarsky’s work on the difficulty of representing certain functions with shallow networks, is sound and addresses a significant open question in the field. The core idea – leveraging chaos theory to understand DNN expressivity – is novel and potentially impactful.\n\nHowever, several concerns prevent me from recommending acceptance at a top-tier conference *in its current form*.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Novelty:** The connection between DNN expressivity and Sharkovsky's Theorem is a genuinely new perspective. Applying tools from dynamical systems to analyze neural network behavior is a promising direction.\n* **Motivation:** The paper clearly articulates the problem and builds upon existing work (Telgarsky) effectively. Identifying the period-3 points in the triangular waves as a potential key to understanding the difficulty of approximation is insightful.\n* **Technical Approach (Potential):** The mention of eigenvalue analysis suggests a rigorous mathematical approach, which is crucial for this type of theoretical work.\n\n**Weaknesses & Concerns:**\n\n* **Lack of Concrete Results:** The abstract promises \"general lower bounds for the width needed to represent periodic functions as a function of the depth.\" However, the abstract *doesn't state what these bounds are*. A top-tier conference requires concrete, quantifiable results, not just the promise of them.  Without knowing the form of these bounds, it's impossible to assess their significance. Are they tight? Are they practically relevant? Do they improve upon existing bounds?\n* **Vagueness:** The description of the \"generalized notion of fixed points, called periodic points\" is insufficient. The abstract needs to be more precise about what constitutes a periodic function in this context and how it relates to the functions DNNs are typically used to approximate.\n* **Complexity & Accessibility:** While novelty is valued, the combination of deep learning and chaos theory is inherently complex. The abstract needs to clearly convey the *intuition* behind the connection, making it accessible to a broader audience within the machine learning community. Currently, it feels overly technical and relies heavily on the reader's familiarity with dynamical systems.\n* **Missing Empirical Validation:** While the paper focuses on theoretical bounds, some discussion of how these bounds relate to empirical observations would strengthen the work. Even a brief mention of experiments or simulations to validate the theoretical findings would be beneficial.\n\n\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe paper presents a fascinating and potentially important idea. However, the abstract lacks the specificity and concrete results expected of a top-tier conference publication. The connection to Sharkovsky's Theorem is intriguing, but the paper needs to demonstrate *how* this connection translates into meaningful insights about depth-width trade-offs.  The current abstract reads more like a research proposal than a completed work.  More detail on the derived bounds, the definition of periodic functions, and a discussion of potential empirical validation are crucial for a positive evaluation.\n\n\n\nFinal Deci"

The core idea – extending GQN to explicitly model objects rather than just scene appearance – is a reasonable and potentially valuable contribution. The claim of viewpoint invariance and hierarchical representation (3D global, 2D local) are also interesting. However, a careful assessment reveals several concerns that, in their current form, likely preclude acceptance at a top-tier conference.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Relevant Problem:** Unsupervised 3D scene understanding and representation learning are active and important research areas.\n* **Clear Motivation:** The paper clearly articulates the limitations of existing approaches like GQN in terms of object-level understanding and proposes a solution.\n* **Logical Extension:** Building upon GQN is a sensible approach, leveraging existing work while addressing its shortcomings.\n* **Initial Results:** The abstract suggests experiments demonstrating disentanglement, compositionality, and generalization, which are crucial properties for any representation learning method.\n\n**Weaknesses & Concerns (based *solely* on the provided information - abstract & title):**\n\n* **Lack of Specificity:** The abstract is quite high-level. It *states* properties like viewpoint invariance and hierarchical representation but doesn't provide any details on *how* these are achieved.  What specific architectural changes were made to GQN to enable object-oriented decomposition?  How is \"object-oriented\" defined and enforced?\n* **\"Without Performance Degradation\" is Vague:** This claim is extremely weak without quantifiable metrics.  Compared to GQN, what specific performance measures are maintained or improved?  Is it reconstruction loss, generation quality, inference speed, or something else?  \"Performance\" needs to be clearly defined.\n* **Limited Scope of Evaluation:** The experiments are described as being on \"datasets of 3D rooms with multiple objects.\" This is a relatively constrained domain.  Generalization to more complex scenes (e.g., outdoor environments, scenes with articulated objects) is not mentioned.  A top-tier conference expects broader evaluation.\n* **Missing Novelty Signal:** While building on GQN is a good starting point, the abstract doesn't clearly articulate *what* is truly novel about ROOTS beyond simply applying GQN to object decomposition. Is the object proposal mechanism novel? Is the way objects are represented novel?  The abstract needs to highlight the key innovative aspects.\n* **No mention of baselines beyond GQN:** Comparing to other relevant unsupervised 3D scene understanding methods (e.g., those based on VAEs, GANs, or other decomposition techniques) is crucial to establish the contribution of ROOTS.\n\n\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe paper addresses a relevant problem and proposes a potentially interesting approach.

The abstract is well-written, clearly outlining the problem, the proposed solution, and the key contributions. The claimed benefits – drastically enhanced gradient signal, logarithmic complexity, theoretical guarantees, and an order of magnitude speedup – are significant and, if true, would represent a substantial advancement in the field.\n\nLet's break down the strengths and potential weaknesses based on the information provided.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Important Problem:** Extreme classification is a genuinely important and increasingly relevant problem. Many real-world applications fall into this category.\n* **Novelty:** The adversarial sampling approach is a clever idea. Using an adversarial model to generate negative samples that better reflect the data distribution is a promising way to improve the signal-to-noise ratio compared to uniform sampling.\n* **Theoretical Foundation:** The claim of a mathematical proof minimizing gradient variance is a major strength. Rigorous theoretical analysis is highly valued in top-tier conferences. The statement about bias removal is also important.\n* **Empirical Results:** The reported order of magnitude speedup is compelling. This suggests a practical impact beyond theoretical contributions.\n* **Clear Contributions:** The three-fold contribution list is well-defined and highlights the key aspects of the work.\n\n**Potential Weaknesses (and questions that would need to be answered by the full paper):**\n\n* **Adversarial Model Complexity:** The abstract doesn't detail the complexity of the adversarial model itself. If the adversarial model is computationally expensive to train or maintain, it could negate some of the gains from improved sampling.  The cost of training *and* using the adversarial model needs to be considered.\n* **Proof Details:** The abstract mentions a proof, but doesn't provide any insight into its assumptions or limitations. A rigorous proof is good, but its applicability to real-world datasets needs to be clear.\n* **Baseline Comparison:** While the abstract mentions \"several competitive baselines,\" it doesn't specify *which* baselines. The strength of the comparison is crucial.  Were state-of-the-art methods used? Were the baselines tuned appropriately?\n* **Dataset Details:** The abstract mentions \"large scale data sets,\" but doesn't provide specifics.

This is a potentially valuable result, as existing methods like ITML and LMNN can be computationally expensive, especially with high-dimensional data.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Strong Theoretical Result:** The claim of an FPTAS with near-linear runtime is a substantial theoretical advance. Achieving this for Mahalanobis metric learning is noteworthy, as it addresses a core computational bottleneck. The use of geometric approximation algorithms and low-dimensional linear programming is a clever approach.\n* **Relevance:** Mahalanobis metric learning remains a crucial technique in various machine learning applications (classification, clustering, retrieval). An efficient algorithm directly addresses a practical need.\n* **Parallelizability:** The mention of full parallelizability is a positive aspect, suggesting scalability and potential for real-world deployment.\n* **Robustness to Noise:** The claim of favorable performance with adversarial noise is a valuable property, indicating the algorithm's practical utility.\n* **Experimental Validation:** The inclusion of experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets is essential for demonstrating the algorithm's effectiveness.\n\n**Potential Weaknesses (based on abstract alone - further review of the full paper and reviewer comments would be needed for a definitive assessment):**\n\n* **Practicality of \"Nearly-Linear\":** The term \"nearly-linear\" needs careful scrutiny.

The motivation is strong – EM, the traditional approach, struggles with scale and memory in these scenarios. The abstract outlines a series of contributions that, if successful, would represent a valuable addition to the field. Let's break down the potential strengths and weaknesses based on the abstract alone, anticipating what a full paper review would likely reveal.\n\n**Strengths (based on abstract):**\n\n* **Relevance:** The problem is highly relevant to modern machine learning, particularly in areas like computer vision and density estimation where high-dimensional data is commonplace.\n* **Novelty:** The proposed approach, encompassing an upper bound for the likelihood, a new regularizer, constraint enforcement, and a simplification based on local principal directions, *appears* novel. The combination of these ideas is particularly interesting. Addressing the numerical instability of direct GMM likelihood optimization with SGD is a key challenge.\n* **Practicality:** The mention of a TensorFlow implementation is a strong positive. Reproducibility is crucial, and providing code significantly increases the impact of the work.\n* **Empirical Validation:** Experiments on standard image datasets suggest a commitment to empirical evaluation, which is essential for demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\n**Potential Weaknesses (based on abstract - requiring further investigation in the full paper):**\n\n* **\"Upper Bound\" Details:** The abstract states minimizing an upper bound is \"numerically much more stable.\" The *why* and *how* are critical. Is this upper bound tight? How does the approximation affect the final model performance? A weak upper bound could lead to poor results.\n* **Regularizer Specifics:** The abstract mentions a \"new regularizer.\" Its design and justification are crucial. What kind of pathological local minima are being addressed? Is the regularizer well-motivated and theoretically sound?\n* **Constraint Enforcement:** GMM training has inherent constraints (e.g., mixture weights summing to one, positive definite covariance matrices). The abstract states a \"simple method\" for enforcing these. Simplicity is good, but it must be *effective* and not introduce significant overhead.\n* **Local Principal Directions:** The simplification using local principal directions is promising for memory efficiency. However, the impact on model accuracy needs careful consideration. Reducing dimensionality *always* involves a trade-off.\n* **Comparison to Existing Work:** The abstract doesn't mention related work. A strong paper needs to clearly position itself within the existing literature on GMMs, SGD, and related techniques. Are there existing SGD-based GMM approaches? How does this work differ and improve upon them?\n\n\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe abstract presents a compelling research direction. The proposed contributions, if well-executed, could significantly advance the field of GMM training. However, the abstract is light on details. A full paper review would need to rigorously assess the theoretical justification for each component, the experimental results (including comparisons to strong baselines), and the clarity of the implementation. The success of this paper hinges on demonstrating that the proposed techniques genuinely overcome the challenges of training GMMs with SGD in high dimensions *without* sacrificing accuracy.

The motivation is well-stated – while empirical evidence suggests some activation functions outperform ReLU, a theoretical understanding is lacking. The paper attempts to bridge this gap by providing theoretical results for 2-layer networks, categorizing activations as \"smooth\" or \"non-smooth\" and linking this property to the behavior of the Gram matrix eigenvalues.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Important Problem:** The question addressed is central to understanding and improving deep learning practice. A theoretical understanding of activation function impact is highly valuable.\n* **Clear Categorization:** The distinction between smooth and non-smooth activations provides a useful framework for analysis.\n* **Interesting Results:** The core findings – that non-smooth activations generally lead to large Gram matrix eigenvalues, while smooth activations can suffer from small eigenvalues in low-dimensional data spaces – are potentially significant. The extension to deep networks alleviating the low-dimensional data issue is also a positive contribution.\n* **Well-Written Abstract:** The abstract clearly summarizes the problem, approach, and key findings.\n\n**Weaknesses & Concerns:**\n\n* **Limited Scope:** The results are limited to 2-layer networks. While the authors mention extensions, the core theoretical contribution is restricted.  A top-tier conference expects more generalizable results, or a very compelling argument for why the 2-layer case is fundamentally insightful.\n* **\"Mild Conditions\" Lack Specificity:** The paper repeatedly refers to \"mild conditions\" on the data. These conditions *must* be explicitly stated and justified. Without knowing what these conditions are, it's difficult to assess the applicability and strength of the results.  Vague conditions are a red flag.\n* **Gram Matrix Focus:** While the Gram matrix is a useful tool, relying solely on its eigenvalues feels somewhat limited.  It doesn't necessarily capture the full picture of training dynamics.  Are there other relevant quantities that could provide a more complete understanding?\n* **Empirical Validation Missing:** The paper is entirely theoretical. While theoretical contributions are valuable, a lack of even limited empirical validation weakens the impact. Demonstrating that the theory aligns with observed behavior, even on simple datasets, would significantly strengthen the paper.  The abstract mentions empirical performance differences, but the paper doesn't attempt to explain them through the derived theory.\n* **Novelty:** The claim of novelty needs to be carefully considered. The paper builds on existing work regarding overparameterization and Gram matrices. The authors need to clearly articulate *how* their contribution goes beyond the current state-of-the-art.\n\n\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe paper presents a potentially interesting theoretical contribution to understanding the role of activation functions. However, the limited scope, vague conditions, lack of empirical validation, and questions about novelty raise significant concerns. While the categorization of activations and the initial results are promising, the paper feels incomplete and lacks the rigor and generality expected of a top-tier conference publication. The \"mild conditions\" are a major sticking point – they need to be clearly defined and justified. Without these improvements, the theoretical results are difficult to interpret and assess.\n\n\n\nFinal Deci"

The core idea – learning diverse skills independently and *then* learning to coordinate them – is a sound and potentially impactful one. The experiments presented, involving tasks like bar lifting, block-in-container placement with pushing, and box pushing with ant agents, demonstrate the framework's applicability to a range of challenging scenarios. The availability of code and videos is a significant positive, enabling reproducibility and further research.\n\nHowever, a top-tier conference demands more than just a good idea and promising results. Several aspects require closer scrutiny. The abstract is reasonably well-written, but lacks quantitative results. Saying the framework is \"efficiently\" coordinating skills is vague. How efficient? Compared to what baselines? This is a recurring theme throughout a potential evaluation.\n\nWithout access to the reviewer comments and author responses, a complete assessment is impossible. However, I can anticipate potential weaknesses and areas where the paper would *need* to strongly justify itself to be accepted.\n\n**Potential Weaknesses (requiring strong justification in reviewer responses):**\n\n* **Novelty:** Hierarchical reinforcement learning and skill decomposition are well-established areas. The paper needs to clearly articulate *what* is novel about their approach beyond simply applying these concepts to bimanual manipulation. The \"skill behavior diversification\" aspect is key here – how is this different from existing methods for learning diverse policies (e.g., using different reward functions, exploration strategies, or latent space variations)? Is the diversification truly beneficial, or is the coordination learning simply benefiting from having a wider repertoire of skills, regardless of *how* they were generated?\n* **Baselines:** The description mentions solving \"challenging collaborative control tasks.\" However, without knowing the baselines used for comparison, it's difficult to assess the significance of the results.  Strong baselines are crucial.  Simply showing that the framework *can* solve these tasks isn't enough; it needs to demonstrate that it outperforms existing methods in terms of sample efficiency, success rate, or robustness.  Were simpler coordination strategies (e.g., hand-engineered policies, basic RL coordination) considered?\n* **Generalization:** The tasks presented are relatively specific. Does the framework generalize to new objects, environments, or task variations? The paper needs to address the limitations of the current experiments and discuss potential avenues for improving generalization.\n* **Scalability:** While the experiments demonstrate success on a few tasks, it's unclear how well the framework would scale to more complex scenarios with a larger number of skills or end-effectors.\n* **Skill Representation:** The paper doesn't detail how the skills are represented. Is it a fixed policy, a parameterized policy, or something else? The choice of skill representation can significantly impact the performance and flexibility of the framework.\n\n**What would constitute a strong author response?**\n\n* **Quantify results:** Provide clear, quantitative comparisons against strong baselines.\n* **Highlight novelty:**  Precisely define the contribution of \"skill behavior diversification\" and explain how it differs from existing approaches.\n* **Address generalization:** Discuss the limitations of the current experiments and outline plans for future work to improve generalization.\n* **Provide ablation studies:** Demonstrate the importance of each component of the framework, including the skill behavior diversification.\n\n\n\nGiven the limited information, and assuming the reviewer comments raised concerns about the points above, I lean towards rejection. The idea is promising, but without strong evidence of novelty, superior performance, and generalization, it doesn't meet the standards of a top-tier conference. A major revision with significantly more thorough experimentation and analysis would be necessary for reconsideration.\n\n\n\nFinal Deci"

The challenge of defining \"useful\" skills and the difficulty of providing dense, accurate supervision are well-motivated. The proposed approach, leveraging weakly-supervised learning and multiple instance learning, is a reasonable and potentially impactful direction. The fact that it works directly from high-dimensional inputs and avoids explicit segmentation/ordering during training is a significant strength. The experimental evaluation across diverse environments (simulation, real-world, procedural, human-collected, discrete/continuous action spaces) is commendable and suggests robustness. The preliminary zero-shot transfer results are also encouraging.\n\nHowever, a top-tier conference demands a very high bar, and while this paper is *good*, it falls slightly short of that bar based on the information provided. Here's a breakdown of strengths and weaknesses:\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Important Problem:** Skill discovery is a fundamental challenge in robotics.\n* **Novelty:** The weakly-supervised approach using multiple instance learning for trajectory segmentation is a solid contribution. It's not a trivial extension of existing work.\n* **Strong Empirical Evaluation:** The breadth of environments and demonstration types used for evaluation is impressive. This demonstrates a degree of generalizability.\n* **Practicality:** The method avoids the bottleneck of manual segmentation, making it more scalable.\n* **Clear Presentation:** The abstract is well-written and clearly conveys the core idea and contributions. The provided website link is a plus.\n\n**Weaknesses (based on abstract alone - more detail would be available with full paper & reviews):**\n\n* **Depth of Novelty:** While the *application* of multiple instance learning to this problem is novel, the core MIL technique itself isn't. The paper needs to clearly articulate *what* is novel about *how* they apply MIL, and what specific adaptations or insights they bring to the table. The abstract doesn't fully convey this.\n* **Zero-Shot Transfer – Preliminary Evidence:** The abstract only mentions \"preliminary evidence\" of zero-shot transfer. Top-tier conferences require more substantial results in this area, especially given the claim of learning *reusable* skills.  How significant is this transfer? What types of new combinations were tested? What are the limitations?\n* **Lack of Quantitative Results in Abstract:** The abstract doesn't include any quantitative results. While not always necessary, including a key performance metric would strengthen the impact.\n* **Comparison to Baselines:** The abstract doesn't mention any comparison to existing skill discovery or trajectory segmentation methods.  How does this approach compare to state-of-the-art?\n\n\n\n**Overall:**\n\nThe paper presents a promising approach to a challenging problem. The experimental setup is strong, and the idea is well-motivated. However, the abstract lacks the depth of detail and quantitative results expected of a top-tier conference publication. The \"preliminary\" nature of the zero-shot transfer results is also a concern. A full review of the paper, including reviewer comments and author responses, would be necessary to fully assess the contributions and address these concerns. However, based solely on the provided information, I lean towards rejection. The work *could* be acceptable with major revisions addressing the weaknesses outlined above, but as it stands, it doesn't quite meet the high standards of a top-tier conference.\n\n\n\nFinal Deci"

The proposed \"Differentiable Hebbian Consolidation\" model, leveraging a Differentiable Hebbian Plasticity (DHP) Softmax layer, appears to be a novel and potentially valuable contribution. The core idea of adding a rapid learning component to the softmax layer, coupled with task-specific consolidation, is well-motivated and addresses a key challenge in the field. The introduction of an imbalanced variant of Permuted MNIST is also a positive aspect, as it highlights a practical and often overlooked difficulty in real-world continual learning scenarios.\n\nHowever, a thorough evaluation reveals several areas of concern that, while not necessarily disqualifying, require significant attention before this paper would be suitable for a top-tier conference.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Novelty:** The DHP Softmax layer and its integration with existing consolidation methods seem like a genuinely new approach.\n* **Relevance:** Continual learning is a hot topic, and addressing catastrophic forgetting is crucial for deploying robust AI systems.\n* **Practical Focus:** The introduction of the imbalanced Permuted MNIST dataset demonstrates an awareness of real-world challenges.\n* **Clear Motivation:** The paper clearly articulates the problem and the rationale behind the proposed solution.\n* **No Additional Hyperparameters:** The claim of requiring no additional hyperparameters is a significant advantage, simplifying the method's usability.\n\n**Weaknesses & Concerns:**\n\n* **Limited Depth of Analysis:** While the results show performance improvements, the paper lacks a deep analysis of *why* the method works. What specifically about the DHP layer contributes to reduced forgetting? Is it the compression of episodic memory, the differentiable nature, or a combination? A more detailed ablation study is needed to dissect the contributions of each component.\n* **Baseline Comparison:** The abstract mentions outperforming \"comparable baselines,\" but the paper needs to be more specific. Which baselines were used, and how were they implemented? A rigorous comparison against state-of-the-art continual learning methods (e.g., ER, iCaRL, GEM, SI) is essential. Simply stating \"outperforms\" is insufficient. The paper should include a table clearly showing performance across all benchmarks for all compared methods.\n* **Hyperparameter Sensitivity (of Baselines):** Were the baselines tuned appropriately? A fair comparison requires careful hyperparameter optimization for all methods, and this should be explicitly stated.\n* **Generalizability:** The experiments are limited to relatively simple datasets (Permuted MNIST, Split MNIST, Vision Datasets Mixture). While the imbalanced Permuted MNIST is a good addition, the method's performance on more complex, high-dimensional datasets (e.g., CIFAR-100, ImageNet) remains unknown. This limits the confidence in the method's generalizability.\n* **Differentiable Hebbian Plasticity Explanation:** The description of the DHP layer is somewhat vague. A more detailed explanation of the mathematical formulation and the underlying principles of the Hebbian plasticity implementation would be beneficial.\n* **Scalability:** The paper doesn't address the potential scalability issues of the DHP layer, especially for large-scale models and datasets.\n\n\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe paper presents a promising approach to continual learning. The core idea is novel and the initial results are encouraging. However, the lack of in-depth analysis, limited baseline comparison, and concerns about generalizability prevent it from being accepted in its current form at a top-tier conference. A major revision addressing the weaknesses outlined above is necessary. Specifically, the authors need to provide a more thorough analysis of the method's inner workings, a more rigorous comparison against state-of-the-art baselines, and evidence of its performance on more challenging datasets.\n\n\n\nFinal Deci"

The core idea – progressively learning representations from abstract to concrete levels, mirroring a “start small” approach – is conceptually sound and potentially valuable. The authors position their work as a novel combination of hierarchical representation learning and progressive learning, which is a reasonable claim given the existing literature.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Novelty:** The combination of progressive learning *specifically* to aid disentanglement in hierarchical VAEs appears novel. While both progressive learning and hierarchical VAEs have been explored, their synergistic application for this purpose hasn't been prominently demonstrated (as the authors claim).\n* **Clear Motivation:** The paper clearly articulates the problem: standard VAEs struggle to preserve all factors of variation when learning hierarchical representations. The motivation for a progressive approach is well-explained.\n* **Quantitative Evaluation:** The authors employ multiple disentanglement metrics (including a novel one) on benchmark datasets. This is crucial for demonstrating the effectiveness of their approach. The inclusion of a new metric suggests a thoughtful consideration of existing evaluation limitations.\n* **Qualitative Results:** Supplementing quantitative results with qualitative analysis is good practice and helps build confidence in the findings.\n* **Well-Written Abstract:** The abstract is concise and effectively summarizes the paper's contributions.\n\n**Weaknesses & Concerns (requiring further scrutiny - these would be addressed in detailed reviewer comments):**\n\n* **Depth of Technical Contribution:** While the *idea* is novel, the paper abstract doesn't convey a significant technical breakthrough. The devil is in the details of *how* the progressive learning is implemented within the VAE architecture. Is it a simple layer-by-layer addition? Are there specific regularization techniques employed during progression? The abstract lacks this detail.\n* **New Metric Justification:** The abstract mentions a new metric, but doesn’t explain *why* existing metrics are insufficient and what specific shortcomings the new metric addresses. This is a critical point that needs to be thoroughly explained in the paper.  Simply stating it \"complements\" a previous metric isn't enough.\n* **Benchmark Datasets:** The abstract mentions \"two benchmark datasets\" but doesn't name them. This is a minor issue, but important for assessing the generalizability of the results.\n* **Comparison Baselines:** The abstract states improvement \"in comparison to existing works,\" but doesn't specify *which* existing works. A strong paper needs to clearly position itself against state-of-the-art methods.\n* **Hierarchical Representation Definition:** The abstract uses the term \"levels of abstraction\" but doesn't define what constitutes a level in their hierarchical representation. Is this based on layer depth, semantic meaning, or something else?\n\n\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe paper presents a promising idea with a clear motivation and a reasonable experimental setup. However, the abstract lacks the technical depth needed to confidently assess the significance of the contribution for a top-tier conference. The success of this paper hinges on the details of the implementation, the justification for the new metric, and a thorough comparison against strong baselines.  Without seeing the full paper and reviewer comments/author responses, it's difficult to make a definitive judgment. It *could* be a strong contribution, but it needs to demonstrate substantial technical merit beyond the core idea.\n\n\n\nFinal Decision: Reject (pending full paper review and author r"

The abstract clearly articulates the motivation – the limitations of existing exploration strategies (step-based vs. trajectory-based) when applied to deep policies – and proposes a novel solution, Deep Coherent Exploration (DCE). The core idea of modeling the last layer parameters as latent variables and using recursive inference is interesting and potentially impactful. The claim of generalization across popular algorithms (A2C, PPO, SAC) and demonstrated improvement in speed and stability are strong positives.\n\nHowever, a top-tier conference requires a very high bar. While the abstract is promising, several critical aspects need careful consideration, which are currently missing from the provided information. Specifically:\n\n* **Novelty:** The abstract states DCE *generalizes* existing methods. This is good, but the degree of novelty needs to be clearly established in the full paper. Is this a truly novel approach to latent variable modeling for exploration, or a clever application of existing techniques? The abstract doesn't provide enough detail to judge this. The connection to prior work on linear policies is mentioned, but the *how* of generalization to deep networks is crucial.\n* **Technical Depth & Scalability:** The abstract mentions \"recursive inference\" for scalability. This is a key claim. The paper *must* provide a detailed explanation of this inference procedure and rigorously demonstrate its scalability, both theoretically (computational complexity) and empirically (runtime on larger, more complex tasks).  Simply stating it's scalable isn't sufficient.\n* **Empirical Evaluation:** While improvements on \"several continuous control tasks\" are mentioned, the abstract lacks specifics. Which tasks? What are the baselines? How significant are the improvements? A top-tier paper requires a comprehensive empirical evaluation with statistically significant results compared to strong, state-of-the-art baselines.  The abstract should hint at the magnitude of the gains.\n* **Ablation Studies:**  Understanding *why* DCE works is important.  Ablation studies are needed to determine the contribution of each component of the framework (e.g., the latent variable modeling, the recursive inference).\n* **Limitations:** A strong paper acknowledges its limitations. What types of environments might DCE struggle in? Are there any hyperparameters that are particularly sensitive?\n\nWithout access to the full paper and reviewer comments/author responses, it's difficult to make a definitive judgment. However, based *solely* on the abstract, the paper shows promise but lacks the detail and rigor expected of a top-tier conference publication. It feels like a good starting point, but likely requires substantial revisions to address the points above.

The core idea – leveraging pre-trained neural link predictors to evaluate the truth value of query atoms within a differentiable framework – is novel and potentially impactful. The authors convincingly argue that existing approaches relying on training large neural networks on generated complex queries are inefficient and data-hungry. Their approach, utilizing existing link prediction models, offers a compelling alternative.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Novelty:** The approach of translating complex queries into differentiable objectives based on neural link predictors is a genuinely new way to address this problem. It moves beyond the typical end-to-end training paradigm for complex query answering.\n* **Efficiency:** The claim of achieving better performance with significantly less training data (orders of magnitude) is a strong one and a major advantage. This addresses a key limitation of current methods.\n* **Strong Empirical Results:** The reported improvements (8-40% in Hits@3) across multiple KGs are substantial and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The comparison to \"black-box\" neural models is well-motivated.\n* **Explainability:** The ability to explain the model’s outcome based on intermediate solutions for query atoms is a valuable contribution, increasing trust and interpretability.\n* **Reproducibility:** The public availability of code and datasets is excellent and crucial for verifying the results and fostering further research.\n* **Clear Writing:** The abstract is well-written and clearly articulates the problem, proposed solution, and key results.\n\n**Potential Weaknesses (addressed in Author Response - see below):**\n\nThe initial reviewer comments highlighted concerns about the scalability of the optimization process (gradient-based and combinatorial search) for very complex queries and large KGs. The authors responded by clarifying that the combinatorial search is used only for smaller subgraphs induced by the query, and the gradient-based approach is more scalable. They also provide empirical evidence demonstrating the scalability of their approach.\n\nAnother concern raised was the sensitivity of the method to the performance of the underlying link predictor. The authors address this by showing results with different link predictors and demonstrating that the framework is robust to variations in link predictor performance. They also acknowledge this as a limitation and suggest future work to explore methods for improving robustness.\n\nFinally, the reviewer questioned the choice of baseline models. The authors justify their choice by explaining the limitations of other potential baselines and highlighting the relevance of the chosen black-box models.\n\n\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThis paper presents a well-motivated, novel, and empirically validated approach to complex query answering over incomplete KGs. The authors have addressed the reviewer concerns effectively, demonstrating a strong understanding of the limitations of their work and potential avenues for future research.

The paper needs to thoroughly analyze the impact of quantization error on the overall performance and demonstrate that it doesn't negate the benefits of the norm-independent bounds.\n* **Constant Factors:** Lower bounds are often asymptotic. The paper should discuss the constant factors involved and their impact on practical performance.

The abstract mentions a metric \"partially based on human judgment,\" but doesn't hint at the results obtained using it. This is a critical omission.\n\nWithout access to the full paper and reviewer comments/author responses, it's difficult to assess the technical depth and novelty comprehensively. However, based *solely* on the abstract, the core idea – applying CycleGAN to Mel-spectrograms for music arrangement – feels somewhat incremental. CycleGAN is a well-established technique, and applying it to a new domain (music) doesn't automatically constitute a significant contribution. The novelty hinges on *how* they adapt CycleGAN, the specific architecture choices, and, crucially, the *quality* of the generated music.\n\nA top-tier conference expects not just a technically sound approach, but also demonstrably superior results compared to existing methods. The abstract doesn't provide any evidence of this. It doesn't mention comparisons to baseline methods, or even a qualitative discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of their generated arrangements. The claim of modeling long-range dependencies effectively needs to be substantiated with evidence. The metric, even if partially subjective, needs to show meaningful differentiation between generated outputs.\n\nFurthermore, the phrasing \"potentially draw sounds for new arrangements from the vast collection of music recordings\" is a bit hyperbolic. While the Mel-spectrogram representation allows for this, the paper doesn't demonstrate it or discuss the implications of copyright or style transfer.\n\n\n\nFinal Deci"

      "response": "## Reviewer Analysis: Disentangling Representations of Text by Masking Transformers\n\nThis paper tackles the important and challenging problem of disentangling representations learned by large language models. The motivation is strong: LLMs encode a wealth of information, but accessing specific aspects of that information (e.g., syntax vs. semantics) is difficult. The proposed approach – learning masks to identify subnetworks responsible for different factors of variation – is novel and potentially impactful. It’s particularly appealing that it leverages *pre-trained* models, avoiding the substantial training costs associated with many disentanglement methods. The framing as “disentanglement via masking” is a clear and concise way to describe the technique.\n\nThe abstract is well-written and clearly articulates the problem, approach, and key findings. The experimental setup, focusing on syntax/semantics and sentiment/genre, is reasonable and provides concrete targets for disentanglement. The claim of outperforming VAE and adversarial methods is significant and, if substantiated, would be a major contribution. The mention of sparsity achieved through magnitude pruning is a nice addition, hinting at potential efficiency gains.\n\nHowever, a top-tier conference acceptance requires a very high bar. Several critical aspects need further scrutiny, which are not apparent from the abstract alone. These would be addressed in full paper review, but are important to consider even at this stage.\n\n**Potential Strengths (assuming the full paper supports these):**\n\n* **Novelty:** The masking approach to disentanglement is a fresh perspective.\n* **Efficiency:** Leveraging pre-trained models is a significant advantage.\n* **Performance:** Outperforming existing methods is a strong result.\n* **Sparsity:** The combination with pruning is promising for model compression.\n\n**Potential Weaknesses/Concerns (requiring investigation in the full paper):**\n\n* **Disentanglement Evaluation:** How is disentanglement *quantified*? Simply showing correlation doesn't guarantee true disentanglement.  Are appropriate metrics used (e.g., Mutual Information Gap, Beta-VAE score adapted for masking)?  A rigorous evaluation is crucial.\n* **Masking Strategy:** The abstract doesn't detail *how* the masks are learned. Is it a greedy approach? Is it differentiable? The learning process is a key aspect of the method and needs to be clearly explained.  The stability and sensitivity of the mask learning process are also concerns.\n* **Subnetwork Interpretation:**  Identifying a subnetwork correlated with a factor doesn't necessarily mean that subnetwork *only* encodes that factor.  The paper needs to address the potential for overlap and mixed representations.\n* **Generalizability:** The experiments are limited to movie reviews.  Does this approach generalize to other datasets and domains?\n* **Comparison Details:** The abstract states performance is \"as well as or better than\" VAEs and adversarial methods. The full paper needs to provide a detailed comparison, including baselines, hyperparameter settings, and statistical significance.\n\n\n\nWithout the full paper, it's difficult to make a definitive judgment. However, based on the abstract, the paper shows promise but has potential weaknesses that need to be thoroughly addressed. A strong full paper could overcome these concerns.

The core idea – explicitly controlling the depth/breadth trade-off in tree search – is potentially valuable. However, based on the limited information provided (title, abstract, and lack of reviewer comments/author responses), a definitive acceptance is difficult to justify for a *top-tier* conference. Here's a detailed breakdown of my reasoning:\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Interesting Idea:** The concept of explicitly controlling the bias-variance trade-off in tree search, analogous to TD(n), is a compelling one. MCTS, while powerful, often relies on heuristics for balancing exploration and exploitation. A method offering more direct control could be a significant advancement.\n* **Clear Positioning:** The abstract clearly positions STS relative to established algorithms (MCTS and random shooting), making it easy to understand the contribution.\n* **Promising Results (claimed):** The abstract states \"consistently achieving higher scores\" on challenging domains. This is crucial, but lacks detail.\n\n**Weaknesses & Concerns (based on limited information):**\n\n* **Lack of Detail:** The abstract is *very* concise. It doesn't explain *how* STS interpolates between MCTS and random shooting. What are the specific mechanisms for controlling the trade-off? This is the core of the contribution and needs elaboration.  Without understanding the algorithm's mechanics, it's hard to assess its novelty and potential impact.\n* **\"Challenging Domains\" – Unspecified:** The abstract mentions experiments on \"challenging domains,\" but doesn't specify *which* domains. This is a major red flag. Top-tier conferences require rigorous evaluation on standard benchmarks. Are these standard RL environments? Are the results statistically significant?\n* **No Reviewer Comments/Author Responses:** The absence of reviewer feedback and author responses is a significant limitation.  Reviewers would likely probe the details of the algorithm, the experimental setup, and the statistical significance of the results.  Author responses would demonstrate how the authors addressed these concerns.\n* **Novelty Concerns:** Interpolating between existing methods isn't inherently novel. The *way* it's done, and the benefits achieved, are what matter. The abstract doesn't convincingly demonstrate sufficient novelty to warrant publication in a top-tier venue.  It's possible STS is a minor tweak to existing methods.\n* **Comparison to Baselines:** While MCTS is mentioned, are other strong baselines included in the comparison?  For example, AlphaZero-like methods or other state-of-the-art planners?\n\n\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe paper presents an interesting idea, but the abstract lacks the necessary detail to assess its true contribution and impact. The claim of \"consistently achieving higher scores\" is insufficient without specifying the domains and providing evidence of statistical significance.  Without reviewer comments and author responses, it's impossible to know how the authors address potential weaknesses.  \n\nGiven the standards of a top-tier conference, the paper, as presented, is not strong enough for acceptance. It needs significantly more detail, a more rigorous experimental evaluation, and a clearer demonstration of novelty.\n\n\n\nFinal Deci"

The core idea – leveraging a MIMO architecture to train independent subnetworks within a single model – is novel and addresses a key limitation of existing efficient ensemble methods (the need for multiple forward passes). The reported results across multiple datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet, and OOD variants) are promising, demonstrating improvements in NLL, accuracy, and calibration.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Novelty:** The MIMO-based independent subnetwork training is a genuinely new approach to achieving ensemble-like benefits. It's not simply another ensemble technique, but a clever way to utilize model capacity differently.\n* **Efficiency:** The claim of achieving robustness gains \"for free\" during inference is a significant advantage. This directly addresses a practical barrier to deploying robust models.\n* **Strong Empirical Results:** The paper demonstrates consistent improvements across a diverse set of datasets, including challenging out-of-distribution scenarios. This suggests the method is not simply overfitting to specific dataset characteristics.\n* **Clear Writing:** The abstract is concise and clearly articulates the problem, proposed solution, and key results.\n\n**Potential Weaknesses & Questions (addressed by author responses - see below):**\n\nThe initial submission likely had some weaknesses, as evidenced by the reviewer comments (which are not provided here, but are implied by the author responses). However, the author responses indicate a strong engagement with the review process and a willingness to address concerns. Specifically, the authors addressed concerns regarding:\n\n* **Comparison to Baselines:** The authors clarified comparisons to relevant baselines, including methods that also aim for efficient robustness.\n* **Ablation Studies:** The authors provided additional ablation studies to demonstrate the contribution of different components of their approach.\n* **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** The authors discussed the sensitivity of the method to hyperparameters and provided guidance on tuning.\n* **Theoretical Justification:** The authors acknowledged the lack of a strong theoretical understanding of *why* this method works and suggested future work to address this.

The central hypothesis – that the cerebellum functions as a biological implementation of a DNI to alleviate forward and backward locking in cortical processing – is novel and well-motivated. The authors attempt to support this hypothesis with a computational model (CC-DNI) tested across a range of tasks, including motor control (reaching), sequential processing (MNIST), and cognition (caption generation).\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Novelty and Significance:** The core idea linking cerebellar function to a modern deep learning solution (DNIs) is genuinely novel. If substantiated, this could significantly advance our understanding of cerebellar computation and its role in broader brain function. The framing of the cerebellum as a “decoupling machine” is a compelling perspective.\n* **Broad Task Coverage:** Testing the model on reaching, MNIST, and caption generation demonstrates a commendable effort to generalize beyond purely motor tasks. This strengthens the argument for a broader role of the cerebellum in cognitive processing, aligning with recent neuroscience findings.\n* **Neurologically Informed:** The authors explicitly connect model deficits to observed impairments in cerebellar patients, which adds biological plausibility. The inclusion of sparse connectivity, mirroring cerebellar architecture, is also a strong point.\n* **Predictive Power:** The generation of specific neuroscience predictions is a hallmark of good computational neuroscience and demonstrates the model’s potential for further empirical validation.\n* **Clear Writing & Structure:** The abstract is well-written and clearly articulates the problem, proposed solution, and key findings.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Model Complexity & Justification:** While the model is applied to multiple tasks, the details of the CC-DNI architecture and the specific implementation of the cerebellar component (approximating BPTT) could benefit from more detailed explanation. The justification for *how* the cerebellum approximates BPTT needs further elaboration. Is this a biologically plausible approximation?\n* **Quantitative Results:** The abstract mentions deficits in models *without* the cerebellar component, but the extent of these deficits isn't quantified. The paper needs to present clear, quantitative comparisons demonstrating the performance improvement conferred by the CC-DNI component across all tasks.  Figures showing learning curves and performance metrics are crucial.\n* **Decorrelation Mechanism:** The claim that sparse connectivity improves learning through decorrelation is interesting, but requires more rigorous analysis.  Is the decorrelation explicitly measured? What specific parameters are affected by the sparsity?\n* **Limited Comparison to Existing Cerebellar Models:** The paper would be strengthened by a more thorough comparison to existing computational models of the cerebellum. How does the CC-DNI model differ from, and improve upon, these existing approaches?\n* **BPTT as a Biological Proxy:** The reliance on BPTT as the \"ground truth\" for temporal feedback signals is a potential limitation. While BPTT is a useful tool in deep learning, its biological plausibility as a direct analogue of cerebellar learning signals is debatable.\n\n\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThis paper presents a promising and innovative idea. The authors have made a significant effort to connect a deep learning concept to a fundamental problem in neuroscience. However, the paper falls short of being definitively \"top-tier\" in its current form. The lack of detailed quantitative results, a more in-depth discussion of the biological plausibility of the BPTT approximation, and a more thorough comparison to existing cerebellar models are significant weaknesses.  Addressing these points would substantially strengthen the paper.

The authors propose a deep learning approach to approximate the ecological inference loss function, enabling the application of various neural network architectures (linear models, DNNs, Bayesian NNs) to this problem. They demonstrate the method on a large dataset from the 2018 Maryland midterm elections, showcasing improvements over benchmarks and highlighting the benefits of network depth, multi-task learning, and latent representations.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Novelty:** Applying deep learning to ecological inference is a relatively novel idea. While ecological inference has a long history, the use of deep neural networks, particularly with Bayesian approaches and representation learning, represents a significant departure from traditional methods. The exploration of Bayesian NNs in this context is particularly interesting.\n* **Practical Application & Dataset:** The application to a real-world, large-scale dataset (Maryland 2018 election data) is a major strength. The use of publicly available ballot images to inform joint learning is also commendable and demonstrates a resourceful approach to data utilization. The scale of the dataset (over 2.3 million voters) is impressive and allows for robust evaluation.\n* **Strong Empirical Results:** The paper presents compelling empirical results demonstrating the effectiveness of their approach. Improvements over polling benchmarks, the benefits of network depth, and the advantages of joint learning are all clearly shown. The finding that learned latent representations outperform raw covariates is also a valuable contribution.\n* **Multi-task Learning & Covariance Recovery:** The focus on multi-task learning and the recovery of the covariance structure of ballots is a sophisticated aspect of the work. This goes beyond simply predicting vote choice and delves into understanding the relationships *between* choices, which is a significant advancement.\n* **Clear Writing:** The abstract is well-written and clearly articulates the problem, approach, and key findings.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Theoretical Justification:** While the authors claim an \"efficient approximation\" to the loss function, the paper lacks a detailed theoretical justification for this approximation. A more rigorous analysis of the approximation error and its impact on the results would strengthen the paper. Is this approximation always valid? Under what conditions does it perform well?\n* **Comparison to Existing Ecological Inference Methods:** The paper mentions \"benchmark data from polling\" but doesn't thoroughly compare against established ecological inference techniques (e.g., weighted least squares, maximum entropy). A more comprehensive comparison would better position the contribution of this work within the existing literature.  How does this approach compare to, for example, the work of King, Rosen, and Tanner?\n* **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** The paper doesn't discuss the sensitivity of the results to hyperparameter choices. Deep learning models are notoriously sensitive to hyperparameters, and a discussion of this aspect would increase confidence in the robustness of the findings.\n* **Interpretability:** While latent representations are learned, the paper doesn't offer much insight into *what* these representations capture.

      "response": "## Review of \"A Block Minifloat Representation for Training Deep Neural Networks\"\n\nThis paper presents Block Minifloat (BM), a novel minifloat representation designed for efficient DNN training. The core idea – exposing the exponent bias as an optimizable field – is interesting and potentially impactful. The reported results, particularly the significant reductions in hardware size and energy consumption compared to FP8 while maintaining accuracy, are compelling. The focus on dense integer-like hardware for FMA operations is also a strong point, aligning with current trends in hardware acceleration.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Novelty:** The concept of exposing exponent bias as a tunable parameter within a minifloat representation appears novel. This is not a trivial extension of existing work on minifloats.\n* **Strong Results:** The reported gains in hardware efficiency (4.1x smaller, 2.3x less energy) and potential speedups for 6-bit BM compared to FP8 are substantial. Matching FP32 accuracy with 8-bit BM is also a significant achievement.\n* **Relevance:** The work directly addresses a critical challenge in deep learning: efficient training. The focus on reducing memory footprint and computational cost is highly relevant to the community.\n* **Clear Presentation:** The abstract is well-written and clearly articulates the problem, proposed solution, and key results.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Lack of Keywords:** The absence of keywords is a minor but noticeable omission. This hinders discoverability.\n* **Limited Detail in Abstract:** While the abstract is clear, it lacks specifics regarding the training setup (e.g., optimizer, learning rate schedule, batch size). More detail would strengthen the initial impression.\n* **No Reviewer Comments/Author Responses:** The complete absence of reviewer feedback and author responses is a significant limitation. A top-tier conference review process *requires* iterative feedback and refinement. Without this, it's impossible to assess how the authors have addressed potential concerns. This is a critical gap. We don't know if there are hidden flaws that haven't been challenged.\n* **Hardware Details:** The abstract mentions hardware size and energy consumption, but doesn't specify *what* hardware is being compared against. Is this theoretical hardware, or actual implementations? This needs clarification.\n\n\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe paper presents a promising new approach to minifloat representation with potentially significant benefits for DNN training. The core idea is novel, and the reported results are impressive. However, the *complete* lack of reviewer comments and author responses is a major red flag. A top-tier conference demands a rigorous review process, and the absence of this process raises serious concerns about the robustness and validity of the work. While the abstract is strong, it's impossible to fully evaluate the paper without knowing how it has been scrutinized and refined through peer review. The lack of detail regarding the hardware comparison is also concerning.\n\nGiven these limitations, particularly the missing review cycle, I cannot confidently recommend acceptance at this time. The potential is there, but the paper needs to undergo a thorough review process to address potential weaknesses and ensure the validity of the claims.\n\n\n\nFinal Deci"

The motivation is well-articulated – high accuracy isn't sufficient; knowing *when* a model is likely to be wrong is critical for real-world deployment. The abstract clearly states the problem, the proposed solution (a post-hoc calibration method using outlier exposure), and a claim of improvement over existing benchmarks (specifically citing Ovadia et al. 2019).\n\nHowever, the information provided is *extremely* limited. We have only the title, abstract, and no reviewer comments or author responses. This makes a definitive judgment very difficult. A strong review requires understanding the methodology, experimental setup, results, and limitations. Based solely on this limited information, several concerns arise, but also some potential strengths.\n\n**Potential Strengths:**\n\n* **Relevance:** The topic is highly relevant to the current research landscape. Uncertainty quantification is a hot topic, and OOD generalization is a major challenge.\n* **Simplicity:** The description of the method as \"simple\" is appealing. Often, the most impactful solutions are elegant and easy to implement. Post-hoc calibration is a practical approach.\n* **Benchmark Comparison:** Explicitly stating improvement over a known benchmark (Ovadia et al. 2019) is good practice. It provides a concrete point of comparison.\n* **Outlier Exposure:** The use of outlier exposure is a reasonable approach to calibration, as it directly addresses the issue of models being overconfident on unfamiliar data.\n\n**Significant Concerns (due to lack of detail):**\n\n* **Methodological Details:** The abstract provides *no* details about how the outlier exposure is implemented. What constitutes an \"outlier\"? How is the calibration performed? Is it a simple temperature scaling, or something more sophisticated? This is a critical omission.\n* **Experimental Setup:** The abstract mentions \"a wide range of corrupted data,\" but doesn't specify *which* datasets were used. The choice of OOD datasets significantly impacts the validity of the results. Were standard benchmarks like ImageNet-C, ImageNet-P, or others used?\n* **Results:** The abstract claims \"significant improvement,\" but provides no quantitative results. What metrics were used to evaluate calibration (e.g., Expected Calibration Error (ECE), Maximum Calibration Error (MCE))? What was the magnitude of the improvement?\n* **Novelty:** While the idea of using outlier exposure for calibration isn't entirely novel, the *specific* implementation and its effectiveness are key. Without details, it's impossible to assess the novelty of the contribution.\n* **Comparison to other Calibration Methods:** While Ovadia et al. is mentioned, the abstract doesn't mention comparison to other common calibration techniques (e.g., temperature scaling, Platt scaling, Dirichlet calibration).\n\n\n\n**Considering the limitations, it's impossible to confidently recommend acceptance for a top-tier conference.** A top-tier conference demands rigorous methodology, thorough experimentation, and clear presentation of results. This abstract only hints at these qualities. It reads more like a project proposal or a very preliminary report. Without reviewer comments and author responses to address these concerns, the paper is likely insufficient.\n\n\n\nFinal Deci"

The authors identify key challenges in this geometric approach – modeling complex relations, handling isomorphic graphs, and utilizing the latent space – and claim their method addresses these, achieving competitive or superior performance to existing methods while scaling to larger graphs and maintaining permutation equivariance.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Novelty of Approach:** Framing graph generation through a geometric lens isn't entirely new, but the specific way GG-GAN tackles the challenges associated with it (isomorphism, complex relations, latent space exploitation) appears reasonably novel. The combination of a geometric interpretation *with* a Wasserstein GAN is a sensible direction.\n* **Scalability:** The claim of scaling to tens of thousands of nodes is significant. Many graph generation methods struggle with scalability, and this is a strong potential contribution if validated.\n* **Permutation Equivariance:** This is a crucial property for graph generation, and explicitly achieving it is a major plus. Non-equivariant models can produce invalid or unrealistic graphs.\n* **Competitive Performance:** The abstract claims competitive or superior performance against state-of-the-art methods. This is essential for acceptance at a top-tier conference.\n* **Clear Problem Statement:** The abstract clearly articulates the problem being addressed and the challenges involved.\n\n**Weaknesses & Concerns (based solely on the abstract - a full paper review would require the paper itself and reviewer comments/author responses):**\n\n* **Lack of Specificity:** The abstract is somewhat vague. What *specifically* is done to address each of the three challenges? \"Modeling complex relations\" is broad; how does GG-GAN achieve this?  The same applies to \"fully exploiting the latent distribution.\"  Without details, it's hard to assess the technical contribution.\n* **\"Good Trade-off\" is Subjective:** Claiming a \"good trade-off between novelty and modeling distribution statistics\" is weak. This needs to be quantified and justified with experimental results.\n* **State-of-the-Art Comparison:** The abstract mentions being \"competitive or surpassing\" SOTA methods. Which methods? On what datasets?  What metrics are used? This is critical information.  The caveat that SOTA methods are \"slower or non-equivariant or exploit problem-specific knowledge\" feels like hedging. A strong paper would directly compare against the best methods *regardless* of these factors.\n* **Geometric Interpretation Limitations:** The geometric interpretation, while potentially powerful, has inherent limitations. Real-world graphs often don't have a natural geometric embedding. The paper needs to address how GG-GAN handles graphs where this assumption is weak.\n\n\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe abstract presents a promising idea with potential for significant contribution. The claimed scalability and permutation equivariance are particularly appealing. However, the abstract lacks the necessary detail to fully evaluate the technical soundness and impact of the work. The claims of competitive performance need to be substantiated with concrete results and comparisons.  Without access to the full paper and reviewer comments/author responses, it's difficult to make a definitive judgment.  However, based *solely* on the abstract, I lean towards requiring major revisions before acceptance.

The core idea of using probabilistic embeddings to precondition exploration policies based on demonstrations is promising and addresses a key limitation of existing hybrid approaches – their data inefficiency. The abstract clearly articulates the problem, proposed solution (PERIL), and key benefits (improved adaptation, robustness to task variations, interpolation capabilities).\n\nHowever, a crucial piece of information is missing: the reviewer comments and author responses. Without these, a truly informed decision is impossible. I will proceed assuming a generally positive initial review, but highlight areas where concerns *would* likely arise and need to be addressed for acceptance at a top-tier conference.\n\n**Potential Strengths (based on abstract):**\n\n* **Novelty:** The \"dual inference strategies\" and \"probabilistic embeddings\" appear to be a novel contribution, offering a new way to integrate IL and meta-RL.  The claim of interpolating between learned dynamics is also interesting.\n* **Relevance:** Combining IL and RL is a hot topic, and improving sample efficiency in meta-RL is a significant goal. Sparse reward environments are particularly challenging, making this work potentially impactful.\n* **Clear Presentation (in abstract):** The abstract is well-written and concisely conveys the core ideas.\n* **Robustness Claim:** The claim of robustness to task alterations and uncertainties is a strong one, and if substantiated, would be a significant advantage.\n\n**Potential Weaknesses & Questions (requiring review comments/author responses to resolve):**\n\n* **Technical Depth:** The abstract lacks technical detail.  How exactly are the probabilistic embeddings constructed? What is the nature of the \"dual inference strategies\"?  A top-tier conference demands a rigorous and detailed technical presentation.\n* **Experimental Validation:** The abstract mentions \"a set of meta-RL benchmarks,\" but lacks specifics.  Which benchmarks?  What baselines are used for comparison?  Are the improvements statistically significant?  The claim of adapting to \"unseen task families\" is particularly strong and requires thorough evaluation.  Simply showing performance on standard benchmarks isn't enough; the paper needs to demonstrate generalization.\n* **Comparison to Existing Work:** The abstract doesn't explicitly position PERIL relative to other hybrid IL/RL and meta-RL approaches.  What are the key differences and advantages over existing methods like GAIL, Dagger, or other meta-RL algorithms incorporating demonstrations?\n* **Scalability:** Meta-RL can be computationally expensive. Does PERIL introduce any additional computational overhead? Is it scalable to more complex tasks and environments?\n* **Sensitivity Analysis:** How sensitive is PERIL to the quality of the demonstrations? Does it require expert demonstrations, or can it work with sub-optimal ones?\n\n\n\n**Assuming the reviewer comments raised concerns about the experimental validation (e.g., insufficient baselines, lack of statistical significance, limited benchmark coverage) and the technical details were not sufficiently clear, and *further assuming* the author responses adequately addressed the technical concerns but only partially addressed the experimental shortcomings, my decision would be a reluctant rejection.**  A top-tier conference requires both strong technical innovation *and* compelling empirical evidence.

The authors directly address the issue of the sheer number of supervised updates required to achieve primate-level performance, proposing and demonstrating three strategies to significantly reduce this burden. The core idea – that a better initialization and selective training can dramatically reduce the need for extensive supervised learning – is both intuitive and potentially impactful.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Important Problem:** The paper addresses a fundamental limitation of current deep learning models of vision when considered from a neurobiological perspective. The energy and coordination costs of millions of precisely timed synaptic updates are difficult to reconcile with biological reality.\n* **Clear Motivation & Framing:** The abstract clearly articulates the problem, the proposed approach, and the key findings. The connection to biological plausibility is consistently emphasized.\n* **Novelty:** While the idea of efficient training isn't entirely new, the specific combination of strategies (better initialization, sparse training, and reduced update epochs) applied to the context of matching a primate ventral stream is novel. The quantitative results – 2% of updates, 54% brain match at birth, 5% synapse training – are striking and suggest a substantial improvement.\n* **Strong Quantitative Results:** The reported reductions in supervised updates (two orders of magnitude) are compelling. The use of “brain match” as a metric, while needing careful consideration (see weaknesses), provides a concrete way to evaluate progress.\n* **Well-Written & Accessible:** The abstract is well-written and easy to understand, even for those not deeply familiar with the field.\n\n**Weaknesses & Concerns:**\n\n* **\"Brain Match\" Metric:** The paper relies heavily on a \"brain match\" metric. The details of *how* this metric is calculated are crucial and need to be thoroughly explained in the full paper. What specific neural data is used? What aspects of the neural responses are being compared (e.g., representational similarity analysis, population coding)? Is this metric sensitive to different aspects of ventral stream function? Without a detailed understanding of this metric, it's difficult to fully assess the validity of the claims.  The abstract mentions V1, V2, V4, IT, and behavior, but doesn't clarify how these are integrated into the \"match.\"\n* **Initialization Details:** The paper mentions \"improving the random distribution of synaptic connectivity.\"  More detail is needed on *how* this improvement is achieved. Is it a specific distribution? Are there constraints on connectivity? This is a key component of the work and needs to be fully elucidated.\n* **Sparse Training Implementation:** Similarly, the method for training only 5% of synapses needs to be described in detail. Is this random selection, or is there a more sophisticated strategy?\n* **Generalization:** While the results are promising, it's important to consider the potential for overfitting to the specific dataset and network architecture used.  The authors should discuss the limitations of their findings and potential avenues for future research to improve generalization.\n* **Comparison to Existing Work:** The abstract mentions \"the current leading model of the adult ventral stream.\" The paper needs to provide a more thorough comparison to related work on efficient learning, unsupervised learning, and biologically plausible neural networks.\n\n\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThis paper presents a promising line of research with the potential to significantly advance our understanding of how the ventral visual stream develops. The core idea is strong, the results are compelling, and the writing is clear. However, the reliance on the \"brain match\" metric without sufficient detail, and the lack of specifics regarding the initialization and sparse training methods, raise concerns.  A strong rebuttal addressing these points would significantly strengthen the paper.  Given the importance of the question and the potential impact of the findings, I believe the paper warrants acceptance *conditional on major revisions* that address the weaknesses outlined above.

The motivation is strong: many real-world graphs are disassortative, and GNN performance suffers in these scenarios. The proposed approach, utilizing global self-attention via adaptive spectral filters, is a reasonable and potentially impactful direction to address this issue. The abstract clearly articulates the problem, the proposed solution, and the key results.\n\nHere's a breakdown of strengths and weaknesses, considering the standards for a top-tier conference:\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Important Problem:** Addressing the limitations of GNNs on disassortative graphs is a crucial research direction. The paper correctly identifies this as a key weakness in the current GNN landscape.\n* **Novelty:** The use of learnable spectral filters for global attention is a novel idea. While spectral methods have been applied to GNNs before, framing it as adaptive global attention is a fresh perspective. This isn't a trivial extension of existing work; it represents a genuine contribution.\n* **Strong Empirical Results:** The claim of outperforming state-of-the-art baselines on disassortative graphs is significant. Performing comparably on assortative graphs is also a positive sign, indicating the method doesn't *hurt* performance on standard graph types. The evaluation on six benchmark datasets is a good start.\n* **Clear Writing (based on abstract):** The abstract is well-written and concise, clearly conveying the core ideas.\n\n**Potential Weaknesses (requiring further investigation in the full paper – these are assumptions based on the abstract alone):**\n\n* **Computational Complexity:** Global attention mechanisms can be computationally expensive, especially on large graphs. The paper needs to address the scalability of the proposed method. The abstract doesn't mention any techniques to mitigate this.\n* **Spectral Filter Implementation Details:** The abstract doesn't provide details on *how* the spectral filters are learned or implemented. This is a critical aspect that needs to be thoroughly explained. The choice of filter basis, learning procedure, and any regularization techniques will be important.\n* **Baseline Comparison Rigor:** \"Outperforming all state-of-the-art baselines\" is a strong claim. The paper needs to demonstrate a fair and comprehensive comparison, including recent and relevant GNN architectures specifically designed for heterogeneous or disassortative graphs.  Simply beating older baselines isn't sufficient.\n* **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** The performance on both assortative and disassortative graphs needs to be robust to hyperparameter settings. The paper should analyze the sensitivity of the method to different hyperparameters.\n\n\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nBased on the abstract, this paper shows significant promise. The problem is important, the approach is novel, and the initial results are encouraging. However, a top-tier conference requires a high level of rigor and detail. The full paper *must* address the potential weaknesses outlined above, particularly regarding computational complexity, implementation details of the spectral filters, and the thoroughness of the baseline comparison.

The attempt to bridge the gap between information-theoretic exploration and practical continuous control is commendable.\n\nHowever, several aspects raise concerns regarding its suitability for a top-tier conference.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Relevant Problem:** Exploration in continuous RL is a crucial area of research.\n* **Sound Core Idea:** The Max-Q Entropy Search (MQES) principle is theoretically motivated and potentially promising.

The authors identify a key challenge: the mixed categorical and numerical properties of layout elements and the need for generalizable representations given limited labeled data.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Novelty:** Applying self-supervised pre-training to layout representation is a relatively novel approach. While pre-training is common in vision and language, its application to structured layout data, especially with the specific challenges outlined, is a valuable contribution.\n* **Scale:** The construction of a 1 million+ slide dataset is a significant undertaking and a strong asset. Large datasets are crucial for effective pre-training.\n* **Tasks:** The introduction of two novel layout understanding tasks – element role labeling and image captioning – is a positive. These tasks provide a good evaluation framework and demonstrate the model’s capabilities beyond simple representation learning.\n* **Results:** Achieving state-of-the-art performance on the proposed tasks is encouraging.\n* **Analysis:** The inclusion of a deep analysis section, exploring the modeling mechanism and potential applications (auto-completion, retrieval), demonstrates foresight and a deeper understanding of the work's implications.\n* **Clear Writing:** The abstract is well-written and clearly articulates the problem, approach, and key results.\n\n**Weaknesses & Concerns (based on abstract alone - lacking reviewer comments & author responses):**\n\n* **Limited Detail in Abstract:** The abstract is somewhat high-level. It mentions a \"multi-dimensional feature encoder\" and \"multi-task learning objective\" but lacks specifics. What *is* the encoder? What are the tasks used in the multi-task learning? This makes it difficult to assess the technical contribution without reading the full paper.\n* **Presentation Slides as a Narrow Domain:** While a large dataset, focusing solely on presentation slides might limit the generalizability of the learned representations. Graphic design is much broader. The paper needs to convincingly argue why presentation slides are a good proxy for general layout understanding or demonstrate transferability to other domains.\n* **\"State-of-the-art\" Claim:** The abstract claims SOTA performance. This needs to be rigorously substantiated in the full paper, including a clear comparison to relevant baselines. What prior work is being surpassed, and by how much?\n* **Lack of Discussion of Limitations:** The abstract doesn't mention any limitations of the approach. All research has limitations, and acknowledging them strengthens the work.\n\n\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe paper presents a promising approach to a challenging problem. The scale of the dataset and the novelty of applying pre-training to layout representation are significant strengths. However, the abstract lacks sufficient technical detail and raises concerns about the generalizability of the findings. A thorough review of the full paper, including the reviewer comments and author responses, is crucial to address these concerns.  The success of this paper hinges on the details of the architecture, the robustness of the evaluation, and a convincing argument for the broader applicability of the learned representations. Without those details, it's difficult to confidently recommend acceptance at a top-tier conference.\n\n\n\nFinal Deci"

      "response": "## Reviewer Analysis: Programmable 3D snapshot microscopy with Fourier convolutional networks\n\nThis paper tackles a challenging problem in computational microscopy – optimizing both the optical encoding *and* the decoding network for 3D snapshot microscopy. The motivation is strong: current methods struggle with the highly non-local encoding required for effective 3D reconstruction from a single 2D image, limiting the applicability of snapshot microscopy. The authors identify a key limitation of existing approaches (UNet-based decoders) and propose a novel solution using Fourier convolutional networks, arguing they are better suited to handle the global information inherent in the encoding.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Novelty:** The application of Fourier convolutional networks to this specific problem – jointly optimizing optical encoding and decoding for 3D snapshot microscopy – appears novel.  The claim that UNets struggle with the non-locality is plausible and well-motivated.\n* **Technical Soundness:** The approach of combining differentiable rendering with a learnable decoder is a solid one, building on established techniques in computational imaging. The choice of Fourier convolutional networks is justified by their ability to capture global relationships.\n* **Strong Results (in Simulation):** The paper demonstrates success in simulation where existing methods fail. This is a crucial finding, suggesting the proposed method genuinely addresses a limitation of the state-of-the-art.\n* **Real-World Validation:**  The performance on a lensless camera dataset provides some validation beyond simulation, which is important. Outperforming existing algorithms on this dataset strengthens the claims.\n* **Clear Writing:** The abstract is well-written and clearly articulates the problem, proposed solution, and key results.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Simulation Reliance:** While the simulation results are strong, the paper heavily relies on them. The real-world validation is limited to *one* dataset from a prototype lensless camera.  A more comprehensive evaluation on diverse datasets, ideally including data from actual 3D snapshot microscopy experiments (zebrafish brain imaging as mentioned in the abstract), would significantly strengthen the paper.\n* **Depth of Analysis of Failure Modes:** While the paper states UNets fail, a more detailed analysis of *why* they fail would be beneficial.  Visualizations of the reconstruction errors for UNets versus the proposed method could provide valuable insights.\n* **Ablation Studies:**  The paper would benefit from ablation studies to understand the contribution of different components of the Fourier convolutional network.  For example, what is the impact of the global kernel size?\n* **Computational Cost:** The paper doesn't discuss the computational cost of the proposed method compared to existing approaches. This is an important consideration for practical applications.\n\n\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThis paper presents a promising new approach to a challenging problem in computational microscopy. The novelty of the method, combined with the strong simulation results and initial real-world validation, makes it a significant contribution. However, the reliance on simulation and limited real-world evaluation are concerns.  The paper would be significantly strengthened by more extensive experimental validation, a deeper analysis of failure modes, and a discussion of computational cost.  \n\nGiven the potential impact and the solid technical foundation, I believe the paper warrants acceptance, but with a strong recommendation for future work to address the identified weaknesses.\n\n\n\nFinal Deci"

      "response": "## Review of \"Target Propagation via Regularized Inversion\"\n\nThis paper revisits Target Propagation (TP), a historically significant but under-explored alternative to backpropagation. The authors propose a specific implementation of TP based on regularized inversion, framing it within the modern context of differentiable programming and demonstrating its applicability to recurrent neural networks. The core idea – a simplified, regularized TP – is sound and addresses a genuine gap in the literature: a clear, practical implementation of TP suitable for modern deep learning frameworks.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Relevance & Novelty:** While TP isn't a *new* idea, the authors correctly point out its lack of a definitive implementation. Presenting a differentiable programming-friendly version, and specifically applying it to RNNs with long sequences, is a valuable contribution. The resurgence of interest in alternatives to backpropagation (due to biological plausibility concerns and potential for efficiency) makes this work timely.\n* **Clear Presentation:** The abstract is well-written and clearly articulates the problem, proposed solution, and key findings. The framing of TP as a regularized inversion problem is a good way to make it accessible.\n* **Theoretical Analysis:** The comparison of computational complexity to backpropagation is a crucial aspect, and the paper claims to delineate regimes where TP is advantageous. This is a strong point if the analysis is rigorous.\n* **Empirical Validation:** Applying TP to sequence modeling problems with RNNs is a good choice, as these are areas where backpropagation can struggle with vanishing/exploding gradients. The emphasis on the importance of regularization is a practical insight.\n\n**Weaknesses (based on abstract alone - a full paper review would require the full text and reviewer comments/author responses):**\n\n* **Depth of Analysis:** The abstract states they \"delineate the regimes\" where TP is attractive. The strength of the paper hinges on *how* clearly and convincingly these regimes are defined. A superficial comparison wouldn't be sufficient for a top-tier conference.\n* **Magnitude of Improvement:** The abstract states the experimental results \"underscore the importance of regularization.\" This is a relatively weak claim. Does regularization merely *enable* TP to work, or does it lead to significant performance *improvements* over backpropagation (with appropriate regularization)? The abstract doesn't provide enough information to assess this.\n* **Comparison to Existing Work:** The abstract mentions Lee et al. (2015). A strong paper would thoroughly compare its approach to other recent attempts to revive or improve TP, or to other alternative training methods (e.g., feedback alignment, direct feedback alignment). The abstract doesn't indicate the extent of this comparison.\n\n\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe paper addresses a worthwhile problem and proposes a reasonable solution. The framing of TP as regularized inversion is a positive step towards making it a practical alternative to backpropagation. However, the abstract leaves several key questions unanswered. The strength of the paper will depend on the rigor of the theoretical analysis, the magnitude of the empirical improvements, and the thoroughness of the comparison to related work. Without access to the full paper and reviewer comments/author responses, it's difficult to make a definitive judgment. However, based solely on the abstract, the paper *has potential* but needs to demonstrate substantial contributions to be accepted at a top-tier conference. It's likely borderline.\n\n\n\nFinal Deci"

The core idea – applying boosting techniques from supervised learning to policy improvement in RL – is novel and well-motivated. The abstract clearly articulates the problem, the proposed approach, and the key theoretical results (sample complexity and running time bounds). The claim of polynomial dependence on relevant parameters *without* explicit dependence on the number of states is a strong one and, if true, represents a valuable advance.\n\nHowever, the provided information is limited to just the title and abstract. A thorough review requires the full paper, including the methodology details, experimental validation (or justification for its absence), and a more detailed examination of the theoretical proofs. Nevertheless, based *solely* on the abstract, several points warrant careful consideration, and raise potential concerns that would need to be addressed in a full paper review.\n\n**Strengths (based on the abstract):**\n\n* **Novelty:** The application of boosting to RL, particularly addressing the non-convexity issue with a non-convex Frank-Wolfe method, appears novel.\n* **Theoretical Guarantees:** The stated polynomial bounds on sample complexity and running time are crucial for a theoretical RL paper and suggest a rigorous approach. The parameters included in the bounds (approximation guarantee, discount factor, distribution mismatch, number of actions) are all relevant and appropriate.\n* **Scalability Focus:** The emphasis on algorithms independent of the number of states is highly relevant to modern RL challenges.\n* **Clear Problem Statement:** The abstract clearly identifies the limitations of existing approaches and positions the work within the broader RL landscape.\n\n**Weaknesses/Concerns (based on the abstract):**\n\n* **\"Weak Learner\" Definition:** The abstract mentions \"sampled-based approximate optimization of linear functions over policies.\" This is vague. The precise definition of a \"weak learner\" in this context is critical. Is it a policy gradient estimate? A linear approximation of the Q-function? The strength of the entire approach hinges on a well-defined and practical weak learner.\n* **Non-Convex Frank-Wolfe:** While acknowledging the non-convexity is good, the abstract doesn't provide any intuition on *how* the non-convex Frank-Wolfe method overcomes this challenge. This is a key technical contribution and needs to be explained more clearly.\n* **Multiplicative Approximation Guarantee:** The mention of a \"multiplicative approximation guarantee\" for the weak learner is positive, but the abstract doesn't specify the constant factor. A large constant could render the approach impractical.\n* **Lack of Empirical Validation:** The abstract focuses entirely on theoretical results. While theoretical guarantees are important, a top-tier conference typically expects *some* form of empirical validation, even if it's on simplified environments. The absence of any mention of experiments is a red flag.\n* **Missing Keywords:** The lack of keywords is a minor issue, but suggests a lack of attention to detail.\n\n\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe paper presents a promising idea with strong theoretical claims. However, the abstract leaves several crucial details unclear. The success of this approach hinges on the precise definition of the weak learner, the effectiveness of the non-convex Frank-Wolfe method, and the practicality of the approximation guarantees. The lack of any mention of experimental results is a significant concern.\n\nGiven the limited information, it's difficult to make a definitive judgment. The paper *could* be a significant contribution, but it requires a much more detailed examination to assess its validity and impact. Without the full paper, I lean towards a rejection, but with encouragement to resubmit after addressing the concerns outlined above.\n\n\n\nFinal Deci"

The motivation is strong – backpropagation is biologically implausible and computationally expensive, making algorithms like FA attractive. The abstract promises convergence guarantees, rate analysis, and insights into implicit regularization properties, all highly desirable contributions for a top-tier conference.\n\nLet's break down the strengths and weaknesses based on the provided information.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Important Problem:** The theoretical understanding of FA is lagging behind its empirical success. This paper directly addresses that gap.\n* **Convergence Guarantees:** Providing convergence guarantees, even for the simplified setting of linear networks, is a valuable contribution. The mention of both continuous and discrete dynamics is a plus, increasing the breadth of the analysis.\n* **Novel Insights into Implicit Regularization:** The discovery of \"implicit anti-regularization\" is particularly interesting. Identifying conditions under which FA *hinders* learning, and then proposing solutions (initialization schemes for implicit regularization), demonstrates a deep understanding of the algorithm. This goes beyond simply showing *that* FA works; it explains *why* and *when* it might fail.\n* **Clear Abstract:** The abstract is well-written and concisely summarizes the key contributions.\n\n**Weaknesses (Inferred - limited information):**\n\nThe biggest weakness is the lack of access to the full paper and reviewer comments. However, we can infer potential issues.  A top-tier conference expects *rigorous* proofs and a *comprehensive* analysis.  The abstract hints at results, but doesn't provide details. Specifically:\n\n* **Linear Networks Limitation:** While analyzing linear networks is a good starting point, a top-tier conference would likely ask: how well do these insights translate to non-linear networks? The paper needs to acknowledge this limitation and potentially discuss future directions for extending the analysis.\n* **Rate Analysis Specifics:** The abstract mentions \"rates,\" but doesn't specify what kind of rates (e.g., convergence speed, error bounds).  The strength of this contribution hinges on the tightness and practical relevance of these rates.\n* **Initialization Schemes:** The proposed initialization schemes need to be thoroughly justified and potentially compared to existing initialization methods.  Are they easy to implement? Do they significantly improve performance in practice (even if only demonstrated empirically)?\n* **\"Negligible Components\" Definition:** The phrase \"negligible components\" needs precise mathematical definition. What constitutes negligibility?\n\n\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nBased solely on the abstract, this paper *has the potential* to be accepted at a top-tier conference. The identified problem is important, the contributions are novel and potentially significant, and the abstract is well-written. However, the limited scope (linear networks) and the lack of detail regarding the rate analysis and initialization schemes raise concerns.  A strong paper would need to convincingly address these concerns with rigorous proofs and a thorough discussion of limitations. Without seeing the full paper and reviewer comments, it's difficult to be certain.

The hypothesis – that multi-modal DNNs exhibit a “greedy” learning behavior – is well-motivated and intuitively plausible. The paper attempts to both diagnose this issue (through the “conditional utilization rate”) and propose a solution (“balanced multi-modal learning”).\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Clear Problem Statement:** The paper clearly articulates the problem of imbalanced modality utilization and its negative impact on generalization. This is a known issue in the field, and framing it as “greedy learning” provides a useful perspective.\n* **Empirical Validation of Hypothesis:** The authors provide empirical evidence supporting their hypothesis across multiple datasets and architectures. The use of “conditional utilization rate” as a metric, while potentially challenging to compute directly, is a reasonable approach to quantify the imbalance.\n* **Novelty of Approach:** The introduction of “conditional learning speed” as a proxy for utilization rate is a clever idea.  The efficiency gain is a significant benefit, making the proposed training algorithm practical.\n* **Solid Experimental Evaluation:** The experiments on three diverse datasets (Colored MNIST, ModelNet40, and Dynamic Hand Gesture Dataset) demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The choice of datasets is appropriate for evaluating multi-modal learning.\n* **Well-Written Abstract:** The abstract is concise and effectively summarizes the problem, approach, and results.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Conditional Utilization Rate – Definition & Justification:** While the concept of conditional utilization rate is interesting, the paper lacks a deeper theoretical justification for *why* this metric accurately reflects the true utilization of each modality. It feels somewhat empirically defined.  A more rigorous connection to information theory or representational learning would strengthen this aspect.\n* **Limited Comparison to Existing Work:** The paper doesn't thoroughly discuss related work addressing modality imbalance.  There are existing techniques (e.g., weighting schemes, adversarial training) that attempt to solve similar problems. A more comprehensive comparison, including a discussion of the advantages of the proposed approach over these existing methods, is crucial.  Simply stating it \"addresses the issue\" isn't sufficient.\n* **Algorithm Details:** The description of the \"balanced multi-modal learning\" algorithm could be more detailed.  How exactly is the learning speed used to balance the contributions of different modalities?  More specifics on the implementation would be helpful.\n* **Statistical Significance:** The paper presents performance improvements, but doesn't consistently report statistical significance tests.  This makes it difficult to assess whether the observed improvements are truly meaningful or due to random chance.\n\n\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThis paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of multi-modal learning. The identified problem is important, the proposed solution is novel and practical, and the experimental results are promising. However, the lack of deeper theoretical grounding for the key metric, limited comparison to related work, and insufficient detail regarding the algorithm and statistical significance hold it back from being a truly outstanding paper.  It's a strong paper, but not quite at the level of a top-tier conference *without revisions*.  A rebuttal addressing the weaknesses outlined above, particularly a more thorough literature review and a more detailed explanation of the algorithm, would significantly improve the paper.\n\n\n\nFinal Decision: Reject (with strong encouragement to revise and r"

If the claims hold, this work represents a major advance in our understanding of neural network optimization, moving beyond the typical reliance on non-convex analysis and stochastic gradient descent's empirical behavior. The abstract is compelling, outlining a series of strong results – a convex reformulation, characterization of the optimal set, connections to SGD, a polynomial-time optimality check, a path to global minima, and insights into hidden layer size.\n\nThe strength of this paper lies in its potential to fundamentally shift how we view and approach neural network training. The claim of *exactly* characterizing optimal solutions is bold and, if true, incredibly valuable. The avoidance of duality-based approaches, as highlighted, is also a positive, suggesting a novel and potentially more direct route to understanding the optimization landscape. The consequences listed (i)-(iv) are all substantial contributions in their own right. Establishing a link between Clarke stationary points and subsampled convex optima is particularly interesting, offering theoretical justification for the success of SGD. A polynomial-time optimality check would be a practical tool for researchers. The path to global minima and the analysis of hidden layer size are also valuable theoretical results.\n\nHowever, a top-tier conference requires *rigorous* validation of such strong claims. Several critical questions arise that would need to be addressed during the review process (and presumably *are* addressed in the full paper, though we only have the abstract).\n\n* **Scalability:** While a convex program is a powerful theoretical tool, its practical scalability for even moderately sized networks is a major concern. The abstract doesn't address this. Is the resulting convex program solvable in practice? What are the computational complexities?\n* **Regularization:** The abstract mentions \"regularized\" networks. The specific regularization used is crucial. Different regularization schemes can dramatically alter the optimization landscape. The paper needs to clearly state the regularization and justify its choice.\n* **Generality:** The results are limited to two-layer ReLU networks. While this is a good starting point, the abstract doesn't discuss potential avenues for extending these results to deeper or more complex architectures.\n* **Proof Complexity & Clarity:** The claim of an \"exact characterization\" implies a highly technical and potentially complex proof. The paper must be exceptionally clear and well-written to convince the community of its correctness.\n* **Novelty:** While avoiding duality is mentioned, the paper needs to clearly position itself within the existing literature on convex relaxations of neural network training.

The abstract suggests a nuanced view, arguing both factors play a role, and presents new technical tools for analyzing this interplay. This is a highly relevant and important topic for a top-tier conference.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Important Problem:** Understanding generalization in deep learning remains a core open problem. This paper directly addresses it with a focus on disentangling architectural and optimization biases.\n* **Novelty (Potential):** The development of new technical tools for bounding and estimating the average test error of the NNGP posterior is a significant claim. If these tools are genuinely novel and effective, they represent a valuable contribution. The claim of *analytically bounding* the error is particularly strong and promising.\n* **Connection to Existing Work:** The paper explicitly connects to and corroborates findings from Valle-Pérez et al. (2019), demonstrating awareness of the existing literature and positioning itself within the current research landscape.\n* **Intriguing Findings:** The observation that gradient descent can select for functions with larger margins than those typically found under the NNGP posterior is interesting and potentially insightful. The idea that MAP functions can generalize best is a counterintuitive result that warrants further investigation.\n* **Clear Abstract:** The abstract is well-written, clearly states the problem, summarizes the key findings, and highlights the contributions. The use of Spanish (\"¿Por qué no los dos?\") adds a touch of personality, though its appropriateness for a formal academic paper is debatable.\n\n**Weaknesses (Based on Abstract Alone - Requires Full Paper Review):**\n\n* **Lack of Specificity:** The abstract is somewhat vague. While it mentions \"new technical tools,\" it doesn't provide any details about *how* these tools work or what makes them superior to existing methods.  The phrase \"careful study\" is also weak; what *specifically* was done?\n* **\"Consistently Estimate\" is Weak:**  Estimating test error is common. \"Consistently\" needs to be defined and justified. What does consistency mean in this context? Is it consistency across different architectures, datasets, or training runs?\n* **NNGP Focus:** The reliance on the NNGP limit, while theoretically convenient, can be limiting.  Real-world networks are finite width, and the NNGP may not fully capture their behavior. The paper acknowledges this with the mention of finite width networks, but the abstract doesn't clarify how the insights from the NNGP analysis translate to practical scenarios.\n* **Margin as a Sole Driver:** While margin is a useful concept, framing it as the primary mechanism for improvement feels potentially simplistic.

The authors propose DDSS, a method to learn fast samplers by directly optimizing for sample quality using gradients. The core idea – differentiating through sample quality – is novel and potentially impactful. The reported results, particularly the FID scores on LSUN church, are *very* strong, demonstrating a substantial improvement over DDPM/DDIM baselines with significantly fewer inference steps. The claim of compatibility with any pre-trained diffusion model is also a major strength, increasing the method’s applicability.\n\nHere's a breakdown of strengths and weaknesses, considering the standards for a top-tier conference:\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Novelty:** Differentiating through sample quality to optimize samplers is a genuinely new approach. While the idea of faster sampling for diffusion models isn't new, *how* they achieve it is.\n* **Impact:** Reducing the number of inference steps from hundreds to 10-20 while maintaining or improving sample quality is a huge win. This directly addresses a major bottleneck in diffusion model deployment.\n* **Strong Empirical Results:** The reported FID scores are compelling. A reduction from FID 51.1 to 11.6 (with 10 steps) is a substantial improvement. The comparison to strong baselines (DDPM/DDIM) is appropriate.\n* **Generality:** The claim of being compatible with any pre-trained diffusion model is a significant advantage.\n* **Technical Soundness (as presented):** The use of the reparametrization trick and gradient rematerialization to enable backpropagation through the sampling process seems reasonable, given the context.\n\n**Weaknesses & Potential Concerns (without access to reviewer comments/author responses):**\n\n* **Lack of Keywords:** The absence of keywords is a minor oversight, but should be addressed.\n* **Limited Ablation Studies:** The abstract doesn't mention any ablation studies. It's crucial to understand *which* components of DDSS contribute most to the performance gains. Is it the GGDM sampler itself, the optimization procedure, or a combination?\n* **Computational Cost of Optimization:** While the inference is faster, the paper doesn't discuss the computational cost of *finding* these fast samplers. Optimizing through sample quality could be expensive. This needs to be quantified.\n* **Sensitivity to Quality Metric:** The method relies heavily on the chosen sample quality metric (FID). How sensitive is DDSS to different metrics? Could adversarial examples be crafted to fool the optimization process?\n* **GGDM Details:** The abstract introduces GGDM but doesn't provide much detail. The flexibility and non-Markovian nature need further explanation. Is GGDM essential for DDSS, or could it work with other sampler families?\n\n\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThis paper presents a compelling and potentially groundbreaking contribution to the field of diffusion models. The results are impressive, and the approach is novel. The weaknesses are not fatal, but they represent areas that would need to be addressed in a full paper review (and hopefully addressed by the authors in response to reviewers).  A top-tier conference would likely accept this paper *conditional* on addressing the concerns regarding ablation studies, optimization cost, sensitivity analysis, and a more detailed explanation of GGDM.

This suggests a more nuanced understanding is needed than a one-size-fits-all approach.\n* **Connection to Trade-off:** Linking the frequency analysis to the accuracy-robustness trade-off provides a potential explanation for a widely observed phenomenon.\n* **Clear Writing:** The abstract is well-written and clearly articulates the motivation, findings, and contributions.\n\n**Weaknesses & Concerns:**\n\n* **Lack of Novelty in Methodology:** The core methodology – frequency analysis using FFT – is not novel. The paper's strength lies in *what* they observe, not *how* they observe it.  For a top-tier conference, a more innovative methodological approach would be expected, or a significantly deeper theoretical analysis building on existing frequency domain techniques.\n* **\"Simply Dataset Dependent\" is Vague:** While the authors state the frequency distribution is \"simply dataset dependent,\" the paper needs to delve deeper into *why* this is the case. What properties of the datasets (e.g., image statistics, data augmentation, inherent complexity) contribute to the observed differences?  Without this, the claim feels descriptive rather than explanatory.\n* **Empirical Support Depth:** The abstract mentions \"empirical findings,\" but the extent and rigor of these findings aren't clear from the abstract alone. A strong paper would need to demonstrate robust results across a variety of models, attacks, and datasets.  The reliance on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet is a good start, but more breadth would be beneficial.\n* **Frequency Constraints Analysis:** The abstract mentions analyzing training with frequency constraints. The impact and novelty of this analysis need to be clearly demonstrated. Is this analysis a significant contribution in itself, or primarily used to support the core claim about dataset dependence?\n* **Theoretical Foundation:** The abstract mentions \"theoretical findings,\" but doesn't elaborate. A top-tier conference expects a solid theoretical grounding for claims, especially those challenging existing assumptions.\n\n\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe paper presents an interesting observation about the frequency characteristics of adversarial examples and their relationship to dataset properties. However, it falls short of the bar for a top-tier conference due to a lack of methodological novelty, insufficient depth in explaining *why* the observed dataset dependence exists, and a lack of detail regarding the theoretical and empirical rigor of the analysis. While the findings are potentially valuable, the paper feels more like a strong workshop paper or a preliminary investigation that needs further development. The connection to the accuracy-robustness trade-off is promising, but requires more substantial evidence and analysis.\n\n\n\nFinal Deci"

The core contributions appear to be a modular implementation of MOBO algorithms, a novel batch optimization strategy (Believer-Penalizer), a GUI for ease of use, and demonstration of automated hardware control.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Relevance:** Automated experimental design is a crucial area, particularly in fields where experiments are expensive or time-consuming. A well-designed platform addressing this need is valuable to the research community.\n* **Multi-objective Focus:** Focusing on *multi*-objective optimization is a significant strength. Many real-world problems involve trade-offs between multiple competing objectives, and a platform specifically designed for this is highly desirable.\n* **Modular Design:** The modular framework for MOBO algorithms is excellent. This allows researchers to easily plug in and test new algorithms, fostering further research. This is explicitly stated as a goal, and a strong one.\n* **Believer-Penalizer (BP) Strategy:** The proposed BP strategy for accelerating batch experiments is a potentially significant contribution. Asynchronous batch optimization is a challenging problem, and a solution that maintains performance is valuable.\n* **GUI and Automation:** The inclusion of a GUI broadens the accessibility of OED to users without extensive programming or optimization expertise. The demonstration of automated hardware control is a strong validation of the platform's practicality.\n* **Clear Abstract:** The abstract clearly articulates the problem, the proposed solution, and the key contributions.\n\n**Weaknesses & Concerns (based on the limited information - a full paper review would require the full text):**\n\n* **Novelty of BP:** The abstract states BP \"allows batch experiments to be accelerated asynchronously without affecting performance.\" This is a *strong* claim. The paper *must* rigorously demonstrate this claim with comprehensive comparisons to existing batch MOBO methods. Simply stating it doesn't suffice. The reviewer comments (not provided here, but assumed to exist) would be crucial in assessing this.\n* **Performance Evaluation:** The abstract mentions \"demonstrate\" of hardware control, but lacks detail on *how* well AutoOED performs compared to existing OED methods (manual or automated) on benchmark problems *and* real-world applications.  Quantitative results are essential.\n* **Implementation Details:** While modularity is good, the abstract doesn’t provide details on the specific MOBO algorithms implemented. Are these standard implementations, or are there novel aspects to those as well?\n* **Scalability:** The abstract doesn't address the scalability of AutoOED. How does it perform with high-dimensional parameter spaces or computationally expensive objective functions?\n\n\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nAutoOED appears to be a promising platform with the potential to significantly impact the field of experimental design. The combination of a modular MOBO framework, a novel batch optimization strategy, a user-friendly GUI, and automated hardware control is compelling. However, the success of this paper hinges on the rigorous evaluation of the Believer-Penalizer strategy and a comprehensive performance comparison against existing methods.  Without strong empirical evidence supporting the claims made in the abstract, the paper falls short of the standards expected for a top-tier conference. The lack of detail regarding the specific MOBO algorithms implemented and scalability concerns also raise questions.\n\nAssuming the reviewer comments and author responses address these concerns with strong experimental results and detailed explanations, the paper has the potential to be a valuable contribution. However, based *solely* on the abstract, there are significant questions that need to be answered.\n\n\n\nFinal Deci"

However, the provided information (title, abstract) raises significant concerns regarding the paper’s readiness for a top-tier conference.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Relevant Topic:** Compositional generalization is a crucial area in AI, particularly for building agents that can interact effectively with humans. The focus on learning *how* to learn compositionally is a step beyond simply achieving compositional generalization on a fixed task.\n* **Potential for Impact:** A well-designed benchmark could indeed spur research in this area. The framing as a game is a reasonable approach.\n\n**Weaknesses & Concerns (based solely on the provided information):**\n\n* **Abstract is Vague and Repetitive:** The abstract spends a significant portion defining compositional learning behaviours – a concept well-established in the field. This suggests either a lack of confidence in the audience’s understanding or a lack of focus on the *novelty* of the work. The phrasing is also unnecessarily verbose (\"Referring to compositional learning behaviours as…\").\n* **Lack of Specificity:** The abstract doesn't clearly articulate *how* the meta-referential games work. What is the structure of the game? How does the \"meta\" aspect manifest? What are the specific stimulus components? Without this detail, it's impossible to assess the benchmark's design.\n* **Baseline Results are Insufficiently Described:** Simply stating that baseline results are provided using \"state-of-the-art RL agents\" is not informative. Which agents? What were the results? Were the results *poor*, indicating a challenging benchmark, or merely unremarkable? The abstract should highlight the key findings of the baseline experiments.\n* **Overly Optimistic Tone:** The statement \"we hope will spur the research community\" feels premature. A strong paper *demonstrates* potential impact through compelling results and a clear articulation of the problem and solution, rather than simply expressing hope.\n* **Keywords are Broad:** While relevant, the keywords are very broad. More specific keywords relating to the game mechanics or the type of RL algorithms used would be helpful.\n\n\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nBased on the abstract alone, this paper appears to be a preliminary investigation with a potentially interesting idea, but lacking in concrete details and compelling results. A top-tier conference demands significant novelty, rigorous evaluation, and clear presentation. This abstract doesn’t demonstrate those qualities. The paper *might* be acceptable with substantial revisions that address the weaknesses outlined above, including a much more detailed description of the benchmark, a thorough analysis of the baseline results, and a more focused and concise abstract.

The core claim – linking weighted means to moment optimization and subsequently to robustness – is potentially interesting and could contribute to the field. However, the provided information (title, abstract, and lack of reviewer comments/author responses) is *extremely* limited, making a definitive assessment challenging. My evaluation is therefore based solely on the abstract and must be cautious.\n\nHere's a breakdown of strengths and weaknesses based on the abstract:\n\n**Potential Strengths:**\n\n* **Novelty (Potential):** The connection between weighted means and higher-order moment optimization isn't immediately obvious and *could* represent a novel perspective. If the proof is sound and the insights are genuinely new, this is a significant plus.\n* **Theoretical Foundation:** The paper explicitly aims to provide a theoretical background for robustness, which is valuable. Many robust methods are empirically driven, so a solid theoretical underpinning is desirable.\n* **Simplicity & Integrability:** The claim that the method is \"simple\" and \"easy to integrate\" is appealing. Practicality is important for conference papers.\n* **Competitive Performance:** The abstract states performance is \"similar\" to specialized robust loss functions. While not a breakthrough, this suggests the method isn't simply a theoretical curiosity.\n\n**Significant Weaknesses & Concerns:**\n\n* **Lack of Keywords:** The absence of keywords is a red flag. It suggests either a lack of attention to detail or difficulty in categorizing the work, both of which are concerning for a top-tier conference.\n* **Vague Claims:** The abstract is filled with broad statements. \"Tighten the upper bound,\" \"improve robustness,\" \"similar performance\" – these need to be quantified and supported by rigorous results. What *specifically* is being tightened, improved, and compared to?\n* **Convexity Trade-off:** The mention of a \"decrease in efficiency\" when preserving convexity is concerning. This suggests a potential limitation that needs to be thoroughly investigated and discussed. The abstract doesn't explain *why* efficiency decreases.\n* **Missing Details:** The abstract provides no information about the specific weighted mean formulation, the types of losses considered, or the datasets used in the experiments. This makes it impossible to assess the scope and applicability of the method.\n* **No Reviewer Comments/Author Responses:** The complete absence of this information is a major issue. A top-tier conference review process *requires* feedback and rebuttal. Without it, I have no insight into potential flaws identified by others or how the authors addressed them.\n\n\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe abstract presents an interesting idea, but it's far too vague and lacks crucial details. The potential novelty is overshadowed by the lack of concrete information and the absence of a review/rebuttal cycle.  A top-tier conference demands rigor, clarity, and substantial evidence to support claims. This abstract doesn't meet those standards. The paper *might* be acceptable with significant revisions and a strong rebuttal to address the concerns outlined above, but based on this limited information, it falls short.\n\n\n\nFinal Deci"

The authors propose DDSS, a method to learn fast samplers by directly optimizing for sample quality using gradients. The core idea – differentiating through sample quality – is novel and potentially impactful. The reported results, particularly the FID scores on LSUN church, are *very* strong, demonstrating a substantial improvement over DDPM/DDIM baselines with significantly fewer inference steps. The claim of compatibility with any pre-trained diffusion model is also a major strength, suggesting broad applicability.\n\nHere's a breakdown of strengths and weaknesses, considering the standards for a top-tier conference:\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Novelty:** Differentiating through sample quality to optimize samplers is a genuinely new approach. While the idea of faster sampling for diffusion models isn't new, the *method* of achieving it is.\n* **Impact:** Reducing the number of inference steps from hundreds to 10-20 while maintaining or improving sample quality is a huge win. This directly addresses a major bottleneck in diffusion model deployment.\n* **Strong Empirical Results:** The reported FID scores are compelling and demonstrate a clear advantage over existing methods. The comparison to strong baselines (DDPM/DDIM) is crucial.\n* **Generality:** The claim of model-agnostic compatibility is a significant advantage.  It suggests the method isn’t tied to a specific diffusion model architecture.\n* **Technical Soundness (as presented):** The use of the reparametrization trick and gradient rematerialization to enable backpropagation through the sampling process appears reasonable, given the context.\n\n**Weaknesses (based on limited information - abstract only):**\n\n* **Lack of Keywords:** The absence of keywords is a minor oversight, but important for discoverability.\n* **Limited Detail in Abstract:** The abstract provides a high-level overview but lacks specifics on *how* the sample quality scores are calculated. Is it a learned metric? A pre-defined one (like FID itself)? This is critical.\n* **GGDM Details:** The abstract mentions \"Generalized Gaussian Diffusion Models,\" but doesn't explain what makes them generalized or how they relate to the optimization process.  Is this a necessary component of DDSS, or just a sampler family explored within the framework?\n* **Computational Cost of Optimization:** While the inference cost is reduced, the abstract doesn't mention the computational cost of *finding* these fast samplers.  Is the optimization process itself expensive? This is a crucial consideration.\n* **Theoretical Justification:** The abstract doesn't hint at any theoretical analysis of why this approach works. A strong paper would ideally provide some insight into the optimization landscape or convergence properties.\n\n\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nDespite the lack of detail in the abstract, the potential impact and novelty of this work are very high. The reported results are impressive.  However, a thorough review of the full paper is *essential* to address the weaknesses outlined above.  Specifically, the paper needs to clearly articulate the sample quality metric, provide details on GGDM, and discuss the computational cost of the optimization process.  A strong theoretical justification would further strengthen the submission.\n\nAssuming the full paper addresses these concerns with sufficient detail and rigor, this work is worthy of publication in a top-tier conference.\n\n\n\nFinal Deci"

The abstract highlights several strengths: interpretability, domain knowledge encoding, and faster training. The evaluation focuses on similarity, predictability (next-step prediction), and the impact of training data size, comparing against state-of-the-art methods.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Novelty:** While VAEs aren't new to time series, the specific architecture and focus on interpretability and domain knowledge integration appear to be a valuable contribution. The claim of faster training compared to GANs is also significant, as GAN training is notoriously unstable and computationally expensive.\n* **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The paper evaluates the generated data using both similarity metrics *and* downstream task performance (next-step prediction). This is crucial; generating data that *looks* similar isn't enough – it needs to be useful. The investigation of training data size is also a strong point, addressing a practical concern.\n* **Potential for Interpretability:** The ability to incorporate domain-specific patterns (polynomial trends, seasonality) is a key differentiator and a significant advantage in many real-world applications. This addresses a common criticism of \"black box\" generative models.\n* **Clear Abstract:** The abstract is well-written and clearly articulates the problem, proposed solution, key contributions, and results.\n\n**Weaknesses (based solely on the abstract - a full paper review would require the full text and reviewer comments/author responses):**\n\n* **\"Similarity\" is Vague:** The abstract mentions \"similarity tests\" without specifying *which* similarity metrics were used. This is a critical detail.  Simply stating similarity isn't sufficient; the specific metric used heavily influences the interpretation of results.\n* **\"Meets or Exceeds\" is Weak:** Saying the VAE \"consistently meets or exceeds\" SOTA performance is a weak claim.  The abstract should hint at the *magnitude* of the improvement. Is it statistically significant? Is it a small improvement or a substantial one?\n* **Noise Reduction Trade-off:** The acknowledgement that noise reduction can deviate from the original data is good, but the abstract doesn't fully explain *why* this deviation is beneficial for next-step prediction. More explanation is needed. Is it removing irrelevant noise, or smoothing out imperfections?\n* **Lack of Specificity:** The abstract doesn't mention the specific state-of-the-art methods used for comparison. This makes it difficult to assess the significance of the results.\n\n\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nBased on the abstract alone, this paper shows promise. The proposed TimeVAE architecture addresses important limitations of existing time series generation methods, particularly GANs, by offering a potentially more stable, interpretable, and efficient alternative. The evaluation strategy is sound, focusing on both data fidelity and downstream task performance. However, the abstract lacks sufficient detail regarding the specific metrics used, the magnitude of the performance improvements, and a deeper explanation of the noise reduction trade-off.  A full review of the paper, including the reviewer comments and author responses, is necessary to determine if these weaknesses are addressed and if the claims are supported by rigorous experimentation.\n\nHowever, the potential impact and the clear articulation of the problem and solution suggest this work is worthy of consideration.\n\n\n\nFinal Deci"

The core idea – learning to reweight samples based on a class-conditioned margin – is conceptually sound and potentially valuable. The connection to MAML, framing the problem as a bilevel optimization, adds a layer of sophistication. The abstract suggests strong empirical results, claiming improvements over state-of-the-art baselines on both clean and robust accuracy.\n\nHowever, a crucial piece of information is *missing*: the reviewer comments and author responses. Without these, a truly informed decision is impossible. My assessment below is based *solely* on the title and abstract, and therefore leans towards cautious optimism, but with significant caveats. A top-tier conference demands rigorous evaluation, and this is currently limited.\n\nHere's a breakdown of potential strengths and weaknesses, anticipating likely reviewer concerns:\n\n**Potential Strengths:**\n\n* **Novelty:** The idea of learning sample weights based on margin, particularly within an adversarial training framework, appears novel. Many existing methods rely on fixed weighting schemes or heuristics.\n* **Theoretical Grounding:** The connection to bilevel optimization and MAML provides a theoretical framework, which is appreciated in top-tier venues.

The trade-off is a major bottleneck in adversarial robustness research.\n* **Clear Abstract:** The abstract is well-written and clearly articulates the problem, proposed solution, and key results.\n\n**Potential Weaknesses (and likely reviewer questions, needing answers from the full review process):**\n\n* **Margin Definition:** The abstract mentions \"multi-class margin.\" This needs to be precisely defined and justified. Is this a standard margin definition, or a novel one? How does the choice of margin definition impact performance?\n* **Bilevel Optimization Challenges:** Bilevel optimization is notoriously difficult to train. The paper needs to demonstrate that the proposed method is stable and scalable. What techniques are used to address these challenges? What is the computational overhead compared to standard adversarial training?\n* **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** Learning sample weights introduces additional hyperparameters. The paper needs to demonstrate robustness to hyperparameter choices and provide guidance on tuning.\n* **Generalization:** While the abstract claims improvements on \"extensive experiments,\" the specific datasets and architectures used are not mentioned.  Generalization to different datasets and architectures is crucial.  Are the improvements consistent across different threat models (e.g., different perturbation budgets)?\n* **Comparison to Strong Baselines:** The abstract mentions \"state-of-the-art baselines,\" but doesn't specify *which* baselines. A thorough comparison to recent and relevant work (e.g., TRADES, MART, FreeAT) is essential.  Simply claiming improvement isn't enough; the magnitude of the improvement needs to be quantified and statistically significant.\n* **Ablation Studies:**  The paper should include ablation studies to demonstrate the contribution of each component of the proposed method (e.g., the margin-based weighting, the bilevel optimization framework).\n\n\n\n**Without the reviewer comments and author responses, it's impossible to assess how well the authors have addressed these potential weaknesses.**  If the reviewers raised significant concerns about any of these points, and the authors failed to provide satisfactory responses, I would lean towards rejection.

The core idea – framing the dynamics of SGDm under covariate shift as a parametric oscillator subject to resonance – is novel and potentially insightful. The authors attempt to bridge theoretical analysis (using ODE approximations and resonance theory) with empirical validation, which is a strength.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Novelty:** The resonance analogy is a fresh perspective on the instability of SGDm under covariate shift. It moves beyond simply stating instability exists and attempts to *explain* why, offering a potential framework for understanding and mitigating the issue.\n* **Theoretical Foundation:** The use of ODE approximations and resonance theory provides a rigorous, albeit limited, mathematical foundation for the observed phenomena.  Connecting the problem to established theory in dynamical systems is commendable.\n* **Empirical Support:** The authors recognize the limitations of the theoretical analysis (linear setting, periodic shift) and attempt to address them with empirical results. Demonstrating resonance-like behavior in non-periodic shifts, nonlinear networks, and other optimizers strengthens the claim that the phenomenon is not merely an artifact of the simplifying assumptions.\n* **Relevance:** The problem addressed is highly relevant to current research trends in continual learning, meta-learning, and reinforcement learning where non-iid data is the norm.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Theoretical Limitations:** The theoretical analysis is *highly* restricted to the linear case with periodic covariate shift. While the authors acknowledge this, the strength of the conclusions drawn from this limited case is questionable. The leap from the theoretical result to the broader claim of \"divergence under covariate shift\" feels substantial.  The paper would benefit from a more nuanced discussion of how the resonance phenomenon might manifest (or not) in more complex scenarios.\n* **ODE Approximation Validity:** The validity of the ODE approximation itself isn't thoroughly justified.  The paper needs to better articulate the conditions under which this approximation holds and the potential impact of violating those conditions.  How sensitive are the results to the step size used in the ODE discretization?\n* **Empirical Scope:** While the empirical results are a positive step, they are somewhat limited in scope. The experiments primarily focus on demonstrating *that* something goes wrong, rather than systematically investigating the factors that influence the resonance frequency or the severity of the divergence.  A more thorough exploration of hyperparameter sensitivity (e.g., momentum, learning rate) in relation to the covariate shift frequency would be valuable.\n* **Presentation:** The paper could benefit from improved clarity in explaining the resonance analogy.  The connection between the mathematical formulation and the intuitive understanding of resonance isn't always clear.\n\n\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThis paper presents a novel and potentially important insight into the behavior of SGDm under covariate shift. The resonance analogy is intriguing and the empirical results provide some support for the theoretical claims. However, the significant limitations of the theoretical analysis and the relatively limited scope of the empirical validation raise concerns.  While the work is not *flawed*, it doesn't yet reach the level of rigor and generality expected of a top-tier conference publication.

The core idea – leveraging mutual information between neuron activations and image regions to find descriptive language – is novel and potentially impactful. The paper addresses a significant challenge in interpretability: moving beyond simple category labels to richer, compositional descriptions of neuron function. The applications demonstrated – analysis, auditing, and editing – are well-chosen and illustrate the potential utility of the approach.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Novelty:** The approach of using mutual information to link neuron activations to natural language is a fresh perspective on neuron interpretation. It moves beyond existing methods that rely on predefined concepts or limited feature sets.\n* **Strong Empirical Results:** The paper demonstrates high agreement between MILAN-generated descriptions and human-generated descriptions, which is a crucial validation of the method. The diversity of models and tasks used in the evaluation strengthens these findings.\n* **Practical Applications:** The three applications presented are compelling. The auditing application, specifically surfacing face-sensitive neurons in supposedly anonymized datasets, is particularly noteworthy and highlights a real-world ethical concern. The editing application demonstrates a tangible benefit of understanding neuron function.\n* **Clear Writing:** The paper is generally well-written and clearly explains the MILAN procedure and its applications. The abstract effectively summarizes the key contributions.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Lack of Keywords:** The absence of keywords is a minor but noticeable omission.\n* **Mutual Information Caveats:** While the use of mutual information is clever, the paper doesn't deeply discuss potential limitations of this metric. For example, mutual information can be sensitive to binning choices and may not always capture the *most* meaningful description, only the one with the highest statistical dependence. A discussion of these limitations would strengthen the paper.\n* **Scalability:** The paper doesn't explicitly address the computational cost of MILAN, especially when applied to very large models or datasets. A brief discussion of scalability would be beneficial.\n* **Qualitative Focus:** While the quantitative agreement with human descriptions is strong, the paper relies heavily on qualitative examples to illustrate the generated descriptions.

Are they limited to specific datasets or architectures?\n\n\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nBased on the abstract and the described approach, this paper appears to be a strong contribution. The combination of analytical rigor and connection to empirical observations in deep learning is particularly appealing. However, the success of the paper hinges on the details of the theoretical derivation, the robustness of the empirical validation, and a clear articulation of the limitations of the linear teacher-student setup.  A thorough examination of the full paper is required to assess these aspects. Assuming the full paper addresses the potential weaknesses outlined above with sufficient detail and evidence, this work is of high quality and suitable for a top-tier conference.\n\n\n\nFinal Deci"

      "response": "## Reviewer Analysis: Neural Network Approximation based on Hausdorff distance of Tropical Zonotopes\n\nThis paper presents a novel connection between neural network approximation, tropical geometry, and Hausdorff distance. The core idea – using the Hausdorff distance between tropical zonotopes to bound the approximation error between neural networks – is interesting and potentially impactful. The authors attempt to bridge theoretical results with practical algorithms for neural network compression, leveraging K-means clustering on these tropical representations.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Novelty:** The application of Hausdorff distance on tropical zonotopes to analyze neural network approximation is a genuinely new approach. This is the paper's strongest point. It offers a different perspective on a well-studied problem.\n* **Theoretical Contribution:** The theorem relating approximation error to the Hausdorff distance is a solid theoretical contribution. Establishing such a link, even for a simplified network architecture (one hidden layer with ReLU), is valuable.\n* **Connection to Practice:** The authors don't stop at theory; they attempt to translate the theoretical insight into a practical compression algorithm. This is commendable.\n* **Empirical Evaluation:** The inclusion of experiments, even described as \"proof-of-concept,\" demonstrates an effort to validate the approach. The claim of competitive performance against existing methods is encouraging.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Limited Scope:** The theoretical results are limited to single-hidden-layer ReLU networks. While this is a common starting point, the applicability to deeper, more complex architectures is unclear. The paper doesn't adequately address how the theory might be extended.\n* **\"Proof-of-Concept\" Experiments:** The experiments are described as proof-of-concept, which suggests they are not comprehensive. The paper needs to be more specific about the limitations of the experimental setup. What datasets were used? What network architectures were tested? How many runs were performed?  The lack of detail makes it difficult to assess the significance of the results.  \"Competitive against non-tropical methods\" is a strong claim that requires more rigorous justification.\n* **Clarity and Accessibility:** Tropical geometry can be challenging for readers unfamiliar with the field. While the authors likely cannot provide a full tutorial, more effort could be made to explain the key concepts and their relevance to neural networks in a more accessible manner. The connection between K-means and the Hausdorff distance in the compression algorithm could also be clarified.\n* **Error Bound Analysis:** The paper mentions theoretical error bounds for the algorithms, but the details are likely buried in the proofs. A more concise and intuitive explanation of these bounds would be beneficial. How do these bounds translate into practical performance guarantees?\n\n\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThis paper presents a promising and novel idea. The theoretical contribution is solid, and the attempt to connect it to a practical algorithm is appreciated. However, the limited scope of the theory, the lack of detail in the experimental evaluation, and potential accessibility issues raise concerns.  For a top-tier conference, the paper needs to demonstrate more substantial empirical validation and a clearer articulation of its limitations and potential for future work.  The current \"proof-of-concept\" nature feels insufficient for acceptance at a highly selective venue.  A major revision addressing the weaknesses, particularly expanding the experimental evaluation and clarifying the theoretical implications, would be necessary.\n\n\n\nFinal Deci"

The abstract presents a compelling argument – avoiding the iterative privacy loss accumulation inherent in DP-SGD by performing privacy accounting upfront via a one-shot sanitization process. This is a significant potential contribution, as DP-SGD’s practical usability is often hampered by the need for extremely careful hyperparameter tuning to manage privacy budgets. The use of characteristic functions and adversarial re-weighting sounds promising and potentially novel. The claim of outperforming other methods empirically is also important.\n\nHowever, a top-tier conference acceptance requires a *very* high bar. Several aspects need careful scrutiny, even without access to the full paper and reviewer comments/author responses. The abstract, while promising, is somewhat vague. For example, \"rigorous privacy guarantees\" needs quantification. What is the privacy budget (epsilon, delta) achieved? How does it scale with dataset size and dimensionality?  \"Outperforms other methods\" is also insufficient; the abstract needs to hint at *how much* it outperforms them and on *which* metrics. Is it utility (measured how?), privacy, or both?\n\nThe mention of \"characteristic function\" is interesting, but its connection to the overall framework isn't immediately clear from the abstract. Is it used for the initial sanitization? How does it relate to the adversarial re-weighting?  The abstract also states the components are \"of independent interest,\" which suggests a potential for broader impact, but this needs to be demonstrated in the paper.\n\nWithout the reviewer comments and author responses, it's difficult to assess how well the authors address potential weaknesses. A strong reviewer response would likely focus on:\n\n* **Technical Details:** A detailed explanation of the one-shot sanitization process. How is the embedding space designed to facilitate privacy? What are the computational costs associated with the characteristic function?\n* **Theoretical Guarantees:** A rigorous proof of the differential privacy guarantees. How tight are these guarantees? What assumptions are made?\n* **Empirical Evaluation:** A comprehensive comparison with state-of-the-art DP generative models (e.g., DP-GAN, DP-VAE) on a variety of datasets and evaluation metrics.  Ablation studies to understand the contribution of each component (characteristic function, adversarial re-weighting).  Sensitivity analysis of privacy parameters.\n* **Scalability:** How well does the approach scale to high-dimensional datasets?\n* **Limitations:** A clear discussion of the limitations of the approach.\n\n\n\nGiven the potential significance of the work, and assuming the reviewer comments haven't revealed fatal flaws, I would lean towards acceptance *if* the authors have convincingly addressed these concerns in the full paper and their responses.

The authors identify computation and scale augmentation as key bottlenecks and propose SCRFD, a method leveraging Computation Redistribution (CR) and Sample Redistribution (SR) discovered via a random search. The results presented, particularly the significant improvement over TinaFace in both accuracy (AP at hard set) and speed, are compelling. The availability of code is also a strong positive.\n\nHere's a breakdown of strengths and weaknesses, considering the standards for a top-tier conference:\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Problem Relevance:** Efficient face detection remains a vital research area with practical applications. The focus on small faces and low-resolution images is particularly relevant.\n* **Novelty:** While the individual components (computation/sample redistribution, search space design) aren't entirely novel concepts, the *combination* and application to face detection, specifically through a random search within a well-defined space, appears to be a novel contribution. The idea of systematically reallocating computation *within* a network, rather than just scaling it up or down, is interesting.\n* **Strong Empirical Results:** The reported performance gains on WIDER FACE are substantial. A 4.78% AP improvement at the hard set *and* a 3x speedup are significant and suggest a meaningful advance.  The claim of a state-of-the-art accuracy-efficiency trade-off is supported by the presented data.\n* **Implementation & Reproducibility:** The public code release is a major plus, facilitating reproducibility and further research.\n* **Clear Writing:** The abstract is concise and clearly articulates the problem, proposed solution, and key results.\n\n**Weaknesses (and potential concerns):**\n\n* **Random Search Justification:** The reliance on random search, while effective, feels somewhat unsatisfying. The paper needs to better justify *why* random search works well in this specific search space. Is there a theoretical basis for its effectiveness, or is it purely empirical? A more detailed analysis of the search space and the distribution of results would be beneficial.  Were any other search strategies considered (e.g., Bayesian optimization)?\n* **Search Space Design Details:** The abstract mentions a \"meticulously designed search space,\" but the paper (as presented in the abstract alone) doesn't provide any details about this design.  The success of the method heavily relies on this design, so the paper *must* thoroughly explain the rationale behind the chosen parameters and ranges.\n* **Generalizability:** While WIDER FACE is a standard benchmark, it's important to consider the generalizability of the approach to other datasets and scenarios.  The paper should ideally include results on at least one additional dataset.\n* **Ablation Studies:** The abstract doesn't mention ablation studies.  It's crucial to understand the individual contributions of CR and SR. How much does each component contribute to the overall performance gain?\n\n\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThis paper presents a promising approach to efficient face detection. The strong empirical results and code availability are significant strengths. However, the reliance on random search and the lack of detail regarding the search space design are potential weaknesses that need to be addressed in the full paper.  A thorough analysis of the search space, ablation studies, and potentially results on additional datasets would significantly strengthen the paper.  Assuming the full paper addresses these concerns, it has the potential to be a valuable contribution to the field.\n\n\n\nFinal Deci"

The core idea – framing Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) within a variational framework to create a proper probabilistic generative model – is interesting and potentially valuable. The authors correctly identify a gap in prior work, which often treats NCAs as discriminative models or lacks rigorous evaluation as generative models. The claim of inherent robustness is also intriguing.\n\nHowever, despite the promising premise, the paper, as presented, falls short of the standards expected for a top-tier conference. My concerns stem from several areas:\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Novelty:** The variational framing of NCA is a genuine contribution. It moves beyond simply *using* NCAs and attempts to build a principled generative model *based on* them.\n* **Biological Inspiration:** The motivation drawn from biological self-organization is well-articulated and provides a compelling narrative.\n* **Initial Results:** The reported ability of the VNCA to generate diverse outputs from a latent vector is a positive sign. The robustness claim, even if preliminary, is worth noting.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Lack of Quantitative Rigor:** The abstract mentions evaluating the VNCA according to \"best practices,\" but the extent of this evaluation isn't clear from the provided information. A top-tier conference demands *strong* quantitative results. How does VNCA compare to other generative models (e.g., GANs, VAEs) on standard benchmarks, even acknowledging the stated performance gap? Simply stating it \"learns to reconstruct samples well\" is insufficient. What metrics are used? What are the actual numbers?\n* **Limited Scope of Experiments:** The description suggests experiments focus on demonstrating *that* the VNCA can generate diverse outputs and exhibit robustness. However, it lacks detail on the *range* of datasets used, the hyperparameter sensitivity, and the ablation studies performed to understand the contribution of different components of the VNCA.\n* **\"Loosely Inspired\" Concerns:** The phrase \"loosely inspired\" is a red flag. While biological inspiration is valuable, a strong paper would articulate *specifically* how the VNCA captures key aspects of biological cellular growth and differentiation. What aspects are modeled, and what are the limitations of this biological analogy?\n* **Missing Details:** The abstract mentions a \"common vector format\" for encoding information. This is a crucial detail that needs to be elaborated upon in the paper. How is this vector learned? What does it represent?\n* **Performance Gap:** Acknowledging a \"significant gap\" to state-of-the-art is honest, but the paper needs to contextualize this gap. Is the VNCA competitive in specific niches? Does it offer advantages beyond performance (e.g., interpretability, robustness) that justify its exploration?\n\n\n\n**Overall:**\n\nThe paper presents an interesting idea with potential. However, the lack of detailed experimental results, quantitative analysis, and a deeper connection to the biological inspiration prevent it from reaching the standard required for a top-tier conference. The paper feels more like a proof-of-concept than a fully developed research contribution. More extensive experimentation, rigorous evaluation, and a clearer articulation of the VNCA's strengths and limitations are needed.\n\n\n\nFinal Deci"

      "response": "## Reviewer Analysis: Understanding and Leveraging Overparameterization in Recursive Value Estimation\n\nThis paper tackles a crucial and timely topic: the impact of overparameterization on the behavior and performance of value estimation in reinforcement learning. The motivation is strong – traditional RL theory often assumes limited capacity function approximators, a situation increasingly distant from modern deep RL practice. The paper attempts to bridge this gap by analyzing overparameterized linear representations, offering both theoretical insights and practical algorithmic improvements.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Important Problem:** Understanding the effects of overparameterization is vital for developing robust and reliable deep RL algorithms. This paper directly addresses this need.\n* **Theoretical Contributions:** The core theoretical result – demonstrating that TD/FVI and RM converge to different fixed points in the overparameterized linear case – is significant. This highlights a fundamental difference in behavior that isn’t captured by traditional analyses. The unified interpretation via norm minimization is also a valuable contribution, providing a new lens through which to view these algorithms.\n* **Practical Implications:** The proposed modification to RM to align its fixed points with TD/FVI, while guaranteeing stability, is a clever and potentially impactful idea. The development of regularizers targeting out-of-span weights and co-linearity is also a sensible approach to improving stability and generalization.\n* **Empirical Validation:** The empirical results, showing improvements in stability and generalization performance, provide support for the theoretical findings and practical techniques.\n* **Clear Writing:** The abstract is well-written and clearly articulates the paper’s contributions.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Linear Case Limitation:** While the analysis in the overparameterized *linear* case is valuable, the extent to which these findings *transfer* to deep neural networks is not fully established. The paper acknowledges this, but a more thorough discussion of the limitations and potential challenges in extending the results to non-linear function approximators would be beneficial.  The \"transferable findings\" claim in the abstract feels somewhat strong given this limitation.\n* **Generalization Bounds:** The generalization error bounds, while present, are described as \"per iterate\" and \"fixed point\" bounds. The practical relevance of these bounds (e.g., how tight they are, how they scale with problem size) isn't clearly discussed.  Are they useful for guiding hyperparameter selection or algorithm design?\n* **Regularizer Justification:** The intuition behind the regularizers (penalizing out-of-span weights and co-linearity) is reasonable, but a more detailed explanation of *why* these specific regularizers are expected to be effective in the context of overparameterization would strengthen the paper.  Is there a connection to implicit regularization in deep learning?\n* **Comparison to Related Work:** The paper could benefit from a more comprehensive discussion of related work on overparameterization in machine learning, particularly in the context of deep learning and function approximation. How does this work build upon or differ from existing research?\n\n\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThis paper presents a solid contribution to the understanding of overparameterization in recursive value estimation. The theoretical results are interesting and the practical techniques show promise. However, the limitations of the linear case and the lack of detailed discussion regarding the transferability to deep networks and the practical relevance of the generalization bounds are concerns. The paper is well-written and the empirical results are encouraging, but it falls slightly short of the exceptionally high bar for a top-tier conference. A revision addressing the weaknesses, particularly a more nuanced discussion of the limitations and a stronger connection to the broader literature on overparameterization, would significantly improve the paper.\n\n\n\nFinal Deci"

The core contributions appear to be a modular implementation of MOBO algorithms, a novel batch optimization strategy (Believer-Penalizer), a GUI for ease of use, and demonstration of automated hardware control.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Relevance:** Automated experimental design is a crucial area, particularly in fields where experiments are expensive or time-consuming (e.g., materials science, chemistry, drug discovery). A well-designed platform addressing this need is highly valuable.\n* **Technical Soundness (Potential):** The use of MOBO is appropriate for OED, given the inherent trade-offs between different experimental objectives. The modular framework is a good design choice, facilitating algorithm comparison and extension. The Believer-Penalizer approach *could* be a significant contribution if it demonstrably improves batch optimization performance without sacrificing quality.\n* **Practical Impact:** The GUI is a significant plus, broadening the accessibility of OED to users without extensive programming or optimization expertise. The demonstration of automated hardware control is a strong indicator of real-world applicability.\n* **Completeness:** The abstract suggests a comprehensive system, covering algorithm implementation, a novel method, a user interface, and a hardware integration.\n\n**Weaknesses & Concerns (Based on Abstract Alone - a full paper review would require the paper itself):**\n\n* **Novelty of BP:** The abstract states BP \"allows batch experiments to be accelerated asynchronously.\" This is a common goal in batch Bayesian optimization.

The motivation is strong – building agents capable of complex, flexible behavior requires efficient and robust motif learning and chaining, and avoiding catastrophic forgetting is crucial. The connection to neuroscience, specifically the thalamocortical circuit, is a particularly interesting aspect, offering a potential source of inductive bias to improve performance.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Novelty:** The combination of continual learning, hierarchical control, and neuroscientific inspiration is novel. While continual learning and hierarchical control are individually well-studied, integrating them with insights from the motor thalamocortical circuit is a fresh approach.\n* **Problem Formulation:** The problem is clearly defined and well-motivated. The authors explicitly identify the two key challenges: preventing interference during motif learning and enabling zero-shot transfer to novel motif chains.\n* **Technical Approach:** The proposed method, constraining RNNs to mimic thalamocortical function during transitions, is a reasonable and potentially effective way to address the identified challenges. The authors acknowledge the trade-off between analytical tractability and expressivity, and their approach seems to strike a good balance.\n* **Results:** The reported results are promising. Demonstrating improved accuracy *and* zero-shot transfer to new motif chains is a significant achievement, especially given the baseline performance of standard RNNs. The claim of \"no performance cost\" for zero-shot transfer is particularly noteworthy.\n* **Neuroscientific Relevance:** The paper doesn't just *use* neuroscience; it attempts to *interpret* its findings in light of brain function, specifically regarding motor preparation. This bidirectional connection strengthens the work.\n\n**Weaknesses & Concerns:**\n\n* **Limited Detail on Thalamocortical Implementation:** While the paper states they constrain RNNs to function *similarly* to the thalamocortical circuit, the specifics of this constraint are not entirely clear from the abstract. The reviewer comments (not provided, but assumed to exist) likely delve into this, and the author responses will be critical.  How exactly is the thalamocortical architecture translated into RNN constraints? Is it a specific layer, a loss function, or something else?  The devil is in the details here.\n* **Baselines:** The abstract mentions \"standard RNNs\" as a baseline, but it's unclear how these were configured and whether they represent a strong baseline.  A comparison to other continual learning methods specifically designed for hierarchical control would strengthen the paper.\n* **Generalization beyond the specific motifs:** The paper focuses on learning and chaining a set of motifs.

How does the computational cost of the thalamocortical constraint scale with the number of motifs or the complexity of the RNN?\n\n\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThis paper presents a compelling and potentially significant contribution to the fields of continual learning, hierarchical control, and computational neuroscience. The core idea is innovative, the problem is well-defined, and the initial results are promising.

If true, the simplicity of BPPO (essentially PPO applied directly to offline data) would be a significant advantage over existing methods that rely on complex constraints or regularizations. The strong empirical results on D4RL further bolster the claim.\n\nHowever, a top-tier conference requires more than just a good idea and strong empirical performance. Several aspects require closer scrutiny. The abstract states a \"surprising conclusion\" that on-policy algorithms *naturally* solve offline RL. This is a strong claim and needs significantly more theoretical justification within the paper itself. The paper mentions \"analysis of offline monotonic policy improvement\" as the basis for this conclusion, but the abstract doesn’t hint at *how* this analysis leads to the stated result. Is it a formal proof? A compelling argument based on properties of PPO? This is a critical gap.\n\nThe claim of outperforming \"state-of-the-art\" algorithms is also somewhat vague. Which algorithms specifically? By how much? A more detailed comparison, including statistical significance, is needed. While D4RL is a standard benchmark, simply stating \"outperforms\" isn’t sufficient for a top-tier venue.

The core idea – leveraging the strengths of both approaches – is promising. Transformers excel at sequence modeling and potentially capturing long-range dependencies in state-action trajectories, while MCTS provides a principled way to navigate the state space and evaluate policies. The claim of improved sampling efficiency is also a significant potential contribution.\n\nHowever, several aspects raise concerns regarding suitability for a *top-tier* conference. The primary concern revolves around the experimental evaluation. The paper *only* evaluates on SameGame. While SameGame is a well-known problem, it's relatively simple compared to the challenges typically addressed in top-tier RL conferences (e.g., Atari, robotic manipulation, complex strategy games). Demonstrating superiority on a single, relatively constrained environment doesn’t strongly support the claim of a generally applicable and impactful method. A top-tier paper needs to demonstrate broader applicability.\n\nFurthermore, the abstract states the method \"outperforms both Transformer-based and MCTS-based solutions,\" but the details of *which* Transformer-based and MCTS-based solutions are being compared against are missing. Are these strong baselines? State-of-the-art methods? Or simpler implementations? Without this context, the performance gains are difficult to assess.

Is MCTS used to refine policies learned from the dataset? Clarifying this aspect is crucial.\n\nThe reviewer comments and author responses are not provided, which limits a complete assessment. However, based on the paper's content alone, it feels like a good starting point for research, but not yet ready for a top-tier conference.

The core idea – leveraging label prior shift to induce specialization and then employing a post-compensation aggregation method – is novel and potentially impactful. The abstract clearly articulates the problem, proposed solution, and claimed benefits.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Novelty:** The approach of inducing specialization via label prior shift is a clever way to generate diverse teachers without relying on complex architectural modifications or explicit diversity constraints. This is a significant contribution.\n* **Theoretical Motivation:** The paper grounds the approach in the natural behavior of stochastic gradient descent under distribution shift, providing a solid theoretical justification.

The motivation is strong – providing theoretical justification for the empirical success of deep networks, even if initially limited to the linear case, is a valuable contribution. The abstract highlights key results: sharp convergence rates independent of initialization type and network depth (given sufficient width).\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Important Problem:** The convergence analysis of deep learning algorithms is a core area of research. Understanding behavior in the simpler linear case is a necessary stepping stone to tackling the non-linear case.\n* **Sharpness Claim:** The claim of *sharp* convergence rates is significant. Many existing analyses provide rates, but demonstrating they are optimal is much harder and more impactful.\n* **Independence from Initialization:** The result that convergence doesn't depend on initialization is interesting. This suggests a robustness property that could be valuable.\n* **Depth Independence (with width condition):** The finding that depth doesn't negatively impact convergence (given sufficient width) is also a positive result, aligning with some empirical observations.\n* **Clear Context:** The abstract effectively positions the work within the existing literature, acknowledging the limitations (linear networks) and referencing related work on loss landscapes.\n\n**Potential Weaknesses (based solely on abstract - a full paper review would require the paper itself and reviewer comments):**\n\n* **\"Appropriately Large\" Width:** The phrase \"appropriately large\" is vague. The paper *must* clearly define this condition – what does \"appropriately large\" mean in terms of network parameters, depth, or data dimensionality? A weak definition here would significantly diminish the result.\n* **Novelty:** While the abstract claims sharpness, it doesn't detail *how* this sharpness is established. Is it a novel technique, a tighter analysis of existing methods, or a new perspective? The novelty needs to be clearly articulated in the full paper.\n* **Linear Networks Limitation:** The abstract acknowledges this, but it's crucial that the paper doesn't overstate the implications for general deep networks. The discussion should carefully delineate what can and cannot be extrapolated.\n* **Lack of Empirical Validation:** The abstract focuses entirely on theoretical results. While theory is valuable, some limited empirical validation (even on simple datasets) would strengthen the paper. Showing the theoretical rates match observed behavior would be a plus.\n\n\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nBased on the abstract alone, this paper *appears* to be a strong contribution. The problem is important, the results are potentially significant, and the abstract is well-written. However, the devil is in the details. The definition of \"appropriately large\" width is critical, and the novelty of the sharpness result needs to be clearly demonstrated. Without seeing the full paper and reviewer comments, it's difficult to be definitive. Assuming the full paper addresses these concerns and the technical analysis is rigorous, this work is suitable for a top-tier conference.\n\n\n\nFinal Deci"

The authors support this claim with a compelling narrative linking asymmetric saturation, relocation of activations near zero, and increased sparsity to performance gains.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Novelty:** While the idea of swapping BN order isn't entirely new, the focused investigation on bounded activations and the detailed analysis of *why* it works is a significant contribution.

The performance improvement needs to be demonstrated on tasks where it matters.\n* **Magnitude of Improvement:** The abstract states \"considerably better performance.\"  A top-tier paper needs to quantify this improvement. What is the percentage gain? Is it statistically significant? Without numbers, \"considerably better\" is subjective.\n* **Generalizability:** While the paper focuses on bounded activations, it would be valuable to briefly discuss (or rule out) whether this phenomenon extends to other activation functions or network architectures. Is this effect limited to specific scenarios?\n* **Related Work:** The abstract mentions previous attempts to swap the order with ReLU.

The paper *must* clearly delineate its novelty.\n* **Theoretical Rigor:** The abstract mentions a \"newly derived upper bound.\" The full paper needs to present this derivation clearly and demonstrate its tightness and relevance. Simply *claiming* a theoretical justification isn't enough. Is this upper bound actually useful for guiding the training process?\n* **Experimental Details:** \"State-of-the-art performance\" is meaningless without specifics. Which datasets were used? Which attack methods were employed? What baseline algorithms were compared against? What metrics were used?  A top-tier conference demands thorough experimentation and a clear presentation of results, including error bars and statistical significance.\n* **Generalization:** The abstract mentions improved \"generalization.\" This is a crucial point. Adversarial training often comes at the cost of standard accuracy. The paper needs to demonstrate that the proposed method *simultaneously* improves both standard and robust accuracy, and that this improvement isn't limited to a specific dataset or attack.\n* **Implementation Details:** Is the algorithm computationally expensive?

The abstract clearly articulates this problem and positions the work as a significant contribution beyond simply demonstrating convergence of q-replicator dynamics (QRD). The focus on average-case performance, coupling attraction basins with equilibrium quality, is a strong and novel idea. The claim of an \"exhaustive comparison\" between gradient descent and the standard replicator, and extension to the broader QRD class, is ambitious and potentially impactful. The interdisciplinary nature – drawing from ML, game theory, and dynamical systems – is also a positive indicator for a top-tier conference.\n\nHowever, a thorough evaluation requires considering potential weaknesses. The abstract uses strong language (\"exhaustive comparison,\" \"optimal learning dynamics\").  \"Optimal\" is a loaded term; the paper needs to *precisely* define what optimality means in the context of QRD – is it speed of convergence, quality of equilibria, or something else?  The phrase \"severe equilibrium selection problems\" also needs to be clarified. What constitutes \"severe\"?  The success of the paper hinges on the specific class of games chosen for analysis. If this class is too narrow or contrived, the results will lack generalizability.  The experimental validation is mentioned, which is good, but the abstract doesn't hint at the scale or rigor of these experiments.  A top-tier conference demands strong empirical support.\n\nWithout access to reviewer comments and author responses, it's difficult to assess how these potential weaknesses have been addressed.

These details are crucial.\n* **\"Significant Improvement\" - Unsupported Claim:** The abstract states \"significant improvement\" but provides no quantitative evidence. Top-tier conferences demand concrete results (e.g., AUC, precision, recall, F1-score) and comparisons to strong baselines. Saying it's better than \"sequence and network based methods\" is too broad; which specific methods?\n* **Baseline Comparison is Weak:** Comparing to \"sequence and network based methods\" as a whole is insufficient. The paper needs to compare against state-of-the-art PPI prediction methods, including those that *also* incorporate sequence or network features.\n* **Transfer Learning Detail Missing:** The claim about cross-species transfer is interesting, but lacks detail. Which species were used for pre-training? How much improvement was observed? What is the mechanism enabling this transfer?\n* **Missing Context on Structure Embedding:** The abstract doesn't explain *how* the structure embeddings are obtained.

The motivation is well-articulated – existing methods largely focus on client-level non-IID data, while the paper correctly points out that the *sampling process itself* introduces another layer of heterogeneity across communication rounds. Framing this as \"period drift\" is a useful conceptualization.\n\nThe proposed approach, FedPA, leveraging a meta-learning framework to learn an aggregation strategy, is a reasonable and potentially effective solution. The idea of treating the aggregator as a meta-learner capable of adapting to the changing distribution of client updates is novel and aligns with current trends in meta-learning. The framing within meta-learning provides a principled way to learn the aggregation weights, rather than relying on heuristics like uniform averaging.\n\nHowever, several aspects raise concerns regarding the paper's readiness for a top-tier conference. The abstract, while outlining the problem and solution, is somewhat vague. \"Competitive performances\" is a weak claim; the extent of the improvement and against which baselines needs to be more specific.\n\nWithout access to the reviewer comments and author responses, a complete assessment is difficult. However, based *solely* on the provided information, the paper feels somewhat light on technical detail. The abstract doesn't give a clear sense of *how* the meta-learner is implemented (e.g., what is the meta-learning objective? What is the architecture of the parameterized aggregator?).

The authors propose a novel bi-objective optimization framework, cleverly addressing the inherent tension between skill and diversity. The core idea of a \"meta bi-objective model\" to encourage Pareto non-domination among high-skill, diverse agents is interesting and potentially impactful. The experimental validation on Pong and Justice Online, while not necessarily state-of-the-art benchmarks, provides a reasonable starting point for demonstrating the approach.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Novelty:** The meta bi-objective approach is a genuinely novel way to address the skill-diversity trade-off. It’s not simply applying existing diversity-promoting techniques; it’s a rethinking of *how* diversity should be encouraged within a self-play context.\n* **Problem Importance:** The issue of limited diversity in self-play is well-recognized and a significant barrier to creating robust and generalizable agents. Addressing this is a valuable contribution.\n* **Technical Soundness:** The description of the evolutionary algorithm and the bi-objective optimization model appears logically sound. The authors clearly articulate the motivation behind their design choices.\n* **Empirical Validation:** The experiments, while limited in scope, demonstrate the algorithm's ability to learn diverse *and* high-performing policies. The inclusion of a commercial game (Justice Online) is a plus, suggesting potential real-world applicability.\n* **Clear Writing:** The abstract and the overall description of the approach are relatively clear and concise.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Limited Baselines:** The paper lacks a comprehensive comparison to existing methods for promoting diversity in self-play. While the authors mention the problem, they don't rigorously compare against techniques like population-based training (PBT), or other evolutionary strategies with diversity objectives.  A stronger comparison would significantly bolster the claim of novelty and effectiveness.\n* **Evaluation Metrics:** The metrics used to quantify \"playing style diversity\" are not fully clear from the abstract.  The paper needs to explicitly define how playing style is measured and demonstrate that the observed diversity is meaningful (e.g., not just random variations).  Simply stating \"various playing styles\" isn't sufficient.\n* **Justice Online Details:** The description of the Justice Online experiments is vague. More details about the game environment, the specific task, and the evaluation protocol are needed.  The complexity of a commercial game makes reproducibility a concern, and more transparency is crucial.\n* **Scalability:** The paper doesn't address the scalability of the proposed approach to more complex environments. Evolutionary algorithms can be computationally expensive, and the meta bi-objective model might exacerbate this issue.\n\n\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThis paper presents a promising approach to a challenging problem. The novelty of the meta bi-objective model is a significant strength. However, the lack of strong baselines and the limited details regarding evaluation metrics and the Justice Online experiments raise concerns.  The paper feels slightly underdeveloped; a more thorough empirical evaluation and a clearer articulation of the diversity metrics would significantly strengthen the contribution.  It's a good paper with potential, but not quite at the level of a top-tier conference *as is*. It would benefit from a major revision addressing the weaknesses outlined above.\n\n\n\nFinal Deci"

The reported AUROC scores (97.95% far-OOD, 98.79% near-OOD) are indeed very strong and competitive with state-of-the-art methods, which immediately grabs attention.

This hinders discoverability and categorization of the work.\n3. **Limited Context:** The evaluation is solely on the LSUN dataset. While good performance there is encouraging, LSUN is a relatively well-studied dataset. A top-tier conference expects evaluation on a broader range of datasets, including those representing more challenging OOD scenarios (e.g., ImageNet-O, CIFAR-10/100-O).  The paper needs to demonstrate generalization capability.\n4. **Comparison to SOTA:** The abstract states performance is \"comparable\" to SOTA.  \"Comparable\" is weak.

The claim of achieving state-of-the-art performance is strong, but not unreasonable given the described approach.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Important Problem:** Text degeneration is a well-recognized and frustrating issue with autoregressive LMs, impacting their usability.

      "response": "## Reviewer Analysis: Scrunch - Preventing sensitive property inference through privacy-preserving representation learning\n\nThis paper tackles a crucial and increasingly relevant problem: privacy in Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS). The motivation is well-articulated – the shift to cloud-based ML introduces significant privacy risks, and existing solutions often fall short due to complexity or overly optimistic attacker models. The abstract suggests a contribution that addresses these shortcomings with a \"lighter\" approach and a more realistic threat model.\n\nHowever, the abstract, while promising, is quite high-level. To make a proper assessment, I need to consider what a top-tier conference expects. Such conferences prioritize novelty, technical depth, rigorous evaluation, and clarity of presentation. Based *solely* on the abstract, several questions arise:\n\n* **Novelty:** The abstract mentions using \"representation learning\" and \"center loss.\" These are established techniques. The novelty hinges on *how* they are combined and applied to the MLaaS privacy problem, and whether this combination is genuinely innovative. The abstract doesn't clearly articulate this. Is it a novel architecture? A novel loss function? A novel training procedure?\n* **Technical Depth:** The claim of a \"lighter approach\" is vague. Compared to *what* specifically? What is the computational complexity of Scrunch? How does it scale with data size and model complexity? The abstract provides no details.\n* **Rigorous Evaluation:** The claim of \"outperforming the benchmark under different privacy metrics\" is good, but insufficient. Which benchmarks? Which privacy metrics (e.g., differential privacy, k-anonymity, membership inference attack success rate)? What datasets were used? The lack of specifics is concerning.  The statement about considering \"less friendly attacker models\" is also important, but needs to be defined. What constitutes a \"less friendly\" attacker?  What capabilities are assumed?\n* **Clarity:** The abstract is reasonably clear, but could benefit from a more concise and impactful description of the core idea.\n\nWithout access to the full paper, reviewer comments, and author responses, it's impossible to definitively assess these points. However, based on the abstract *alone*, the paper feels somewhat under-developed for a top-tier conference. It *identifies* an important problem and *claims* improvements, but lacks the concrete details needed to convince a skeptical audience. A strong paper would provide a more compelling narrative of its technical contributions and empirical validation. The abstract reads more like a project proposal than a finished research contribution.\n\nIf the reviewer comments highlighted these weaknesses (lack of detail, insufficient novelty, weak evaluation), and the author responses did not adequately address them with concrete technical details and experimental results, then a rejection is warranted. If, however, the full paper and responses demonstrate substantial novelty, rigorous evaluation, and a clear explanation of the technical contributions, then a reconsideration for acceptance would be appropriate.\n\n\n\nFinal Deci"

      "response": "## Review of \"Proximal Validation Protocol\"\n\nThis paper tackles a practically relevant problem: the trade-off between validation set size and training data size in machine learning, particularly in production settings where a held-out test set isn't always available. The motivation – a gap between academic research and ML production leading to “technical debt” – is also a valid and increasingly discussed concern. The core idea of using a “proximal set” constructed via data augmentation and distributional sampling is interesting and potentially valuable.\n\nHowever, several aspects of the paper raise significant concerns, making acceptance at a top-tier conference difficult.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Practical Relevance:** The problem addressed is genuinely important for real-world ML deployments.  Reliable validation is crucial, and the paper correctly identifies the challenges of balancing validation set size with training data.\n* **Novelty (Potential):** The concept of a \"proximal set\" and the proposed construction method (dense augmentation + distributional sampling) *could* represent a novel approach.\n* **Empirical Evaluation:** The authors claim to have evaluated PVP on three data modalities, which is a good start for demonstrating generalizability.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Lack of Specificity & Rigor:** The abstract is vague. Terms like \"much better\" are not quantifiable. What *specifically* constitutes \"distributional consistency\"? The abstract doesn't give a clear indication of *how* PVP works beyond mentioning augmentation and sampling.  A top-tier conference demands precise technical descriptions.\n* **Missing Keywords:** The absence of keywords is a significant oversight. It hinders discoverability and categorization.\n* **Weak Motivation Framing:** While the \"technical debt\" framing is interesting, it feels somewhat hand-wavy.  A stronger connection to existing literature on validation strategies, model selection bias, or transfer learning would be beneficial.  The paper needs to more clearly articulate *why* existing methods are insufficient.\n* **Insufficient Detail in the Abstract:** The abstract doesn't mention *which* existing validation protocols PVP is compared against.  Is it simply train/validation split with varying ratios? Or more sophisticated techniques like k-fold cross-validation? This is critical for assessing the significance of the results.\n* **Overly Strong Claims:** The claim that PVP \"works (much) better than all other existing validation protocols\" is a very strong statement that requires extremely robust evidence. The abstract provides no indication of the magnitude of the improvement or the statistical significance of the results.\n* **No Mention of Computational Cost:** Data augmentation, especially \"dense\" augmentation, can be computationally expensive. The paper needs to address the practical cost of using PVP.\n\n\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe paper presents an interesting idea, but the abstract lacks the detail and rigor expected of a top-tier conference publication. The claims are too strong without supporting evidence in the abstract. The missing keywords and vague descriptions raise concerns about the overall quality of the work. While the problem is important, the paper, based on the abstract alone, doesn't demonstrate a sufficiently significant contribution to warrant acceptance. More information is needed to assess the technical soundness and practical value of the proposed approach.\n\n\n\nFinal Deci"

The core idea – leveraging the strengths of multiple adversarial training techniques by having models train each other using their respective adversarial examples and logits – is conceptually sound and potentially impactful. The claim of achieving state-of-the-art robustness on CIFAR-10 under Auto-Attack is significant.\n\nHowever, a critical evaluation reveals several areas needing improvement before this work would be suitable for a top-tier conference.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Novelty:** The idea of collaborative adversarial training, where models actively learn from each other’s vulnerabilities, is a fresh perspective in the field. It moves beyond simply selecting a single \"best\" adversarial training method.\n* **Strong Empirical Results:** The claim of SOTA performance on CIFAR-10 with Auto-Attack is a strong positive. This suggests the method is not merely theoretically interesting but also practically effective.\n* **Clear Motivation:** The paper clearly articulates the motivation behind the approach – the complementary nature of different adversarial training methods.\n* **Concise Abstract:** The abstract effectively summarizes the problem, proposed solution, and key results.\n\n**Weaknesses & Concerns:**\n\n* **Lack of Keywords:** The absence of keywords is a significant oversight. This hinders discoverability and categorization of the paper.\n* **Limited Detail in the Abstract:** While concise, the abstract lacks specifics. What *specifically* does \"guide the training\" mean? How are the logits used? More detail would be beneficial.\n* **Missing Related Work Discussion:** The abstract mentions previous adversarial training methods (AT, TRADES) but doesn't contextualize CAT within the broader landscape of adversarial training research. A thorough related work section is crucial to demonstrate the contribution of this work.  How does CAT compare to ensemble methods or other multi-objective adversarial training approaches?\n* **Experimental Details:** The abstract mentions CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, but lacks details about network architectures, hyperparameter settings, and training procedures. Reproducibility is paramount, and these details are essential.  What models were used (e.g., ResNet, WideResNet)? What were the perturbation budgets (epsilon)?\n* **Generalizability:** The results are presented only on CIFAR datasets. A top-tier conference would expect some evaluation on more complex datasets like ImageNet to assess the generalizability of the proposed method.\n* **Ablation Studies:** The paper needs ablation studies to understand the contribution of each component of CAT. For example, what happens if you only use adversarial examples from one network? What is the impact of using different loss functions for guiding the training?\n* **Logit Guidance Mechanism:** The description of using the \"logit of the peer network to guide the training\" is vague. The paper needs to clearly explain the mathematical formulation and rationale behind this guidance mechanism.\n\n\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe paper presents a promising idea with strong initial results. However, the lack of detail, missing related work discussion, limited experimental scope, and absence of ablation studies prevent it from meeting the standards of a top-tier conference in its current form. The core contribution is potentially significant, but it needs to be more thoroughly investigated and presented. A major revision addressing the weaknesses outlined above is necessary.\n\n\n\nFinal Deci"

      "response": "## Review of \"Data Leakage in Tabular Federated Learning\"\n\nThis paper addresses a critical and timely problem: data leakage in Federated Learning (FL) applied to tabular data. While privacy concerns in FL have been extensively studied for image and NLP data, the unique challenges posed by tabular data have received comparatively less attention. This work directly tackles that gap, presenting a novel attack, TabLeak, specifically designed for reconstructing tabular data from FL updates.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Novelty & Importance:** The paper identifies a significant vulnerability in a practically relevant setting. The application of FL to sensitive tabular data (finance, healthcare, legal) is growing, and demonstrating the potential for leakage is crucial. The focus on tabular data, and the acknowledgement of its unique challenges compared to image/NLP, is a strong point.\n* **Technical Contribution:** TabLeak appears to be a well-designed attack. The three key ingredients – softmax structural prior, pooled ensembling, and entropy-based reconstruction quality assessment – address the specific difficulties of tabular data reconstruction effectively. Converting the mixed discrete-continuous problem into a continuous one via the softmax prior is a clever approach. The pooled ensembling is also a sensible way to combat variance.\n* **Empirical Evaluation:** The experimental results on four popular tabular datasets are encouraging. The 10% improvement over baseline on the Adult dataset with a batch size of 32 is a meaningful result, and the ability to achieve non-trivial reconstructions with larger batch sizes (128) is noteworthy. This demonstrates the attack's robustness to a practical parameter.\n* **Clear Writing:** The abstract is well-written and clearly articulates the problem, proposed solution, and key findings. The keywords are appropriate.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Limited Discussion of Mitigation Strategies:** While the paper effectively demonstrates the *existence* of the vulnerability, it lacks a discussion of potential mitigation strategies. A top-tier conference paper should ideally offer some initial thoughts on how to defend against the proposed attack, even if it's just outlining future research directions. Simply pointing out the problem isn't enough; suggesting avenues for solutions is highly valued.\n* **Depth of Comparison to Baselines:** While the paper states improvement over a baseline, the description of the baseline itself is somewhat lacking. More detail on the baseline attack and why TabLeak outperforms it would strengthen the paper. Is the baseline a direct adaptation of existing image/NLP attacks, or something else?\n* **Reconstruction Quality Assessment:** The use of entropy as a reconstruction quality measure is interesting, but the justification for its effectiveness could be more thorough. Why is entropy a good proxy for reconstruction accuracy in this context? A more detailed explanation or comparison to other reconstruction quality metrics would be beneficial.\n\n\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThis paper presents a solid contribution to the field of Federated Learning security. The identified vulnerability is important, the proposed attack is novel and well-motivated, and the empirical results are promising. The weaknesses, while present, are not fatal. The lack of mitigation discussion is the most significant concern, but the paper's strength in demonstrating the attack itself is substantial. Given the importance of the problem and the technical merit of the proposed solution, I believe the paper is suitable for a top-tier conference, *provided* the authors address the reviewer comments regarding mitigation strategies and baseline comparison in a revision.\n\nFinal Deci"

      "response": "## Reviewer Analysis: Regression with Label Differential Privacy\n\nThis paper tackles the important and increasingly relevant problem of training regression models with label differential privacy (DP). The core idea – leveraging a global prior on label values to optimize a randomized response mechanism – is a potentially valuable contribution. The claim of optimality under a given regression loss function is strong and, if true, significant. Let's break down the strengths and weaknesses based on the provided information (title, abstract, and keywords).\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Relevance:** Label DP is a crucial area. Protecting label privacy is often more practical than feature privacy, and this work directly addresses that.\n* **Novelty (Potential):** The \"randomized response on bins\" approach, coupled with the claim of optimality, suggests a novel contribution.  Simply applying DP to regression isn't enough for a top-tier conference; a new technique or significant improvement is needed. The use of a global prior is a clever idea.\n* **Theoretical Foundation:** The paper claims to *derive* an optimal mechanism and *prove* its form. This is a strong indicator of a rigorous approach, which is essential for a top-tier conference.\n* **Empirical Validation:** The abstract mentions a \"thorough experimental evaluation,\" which is vital for demonstrating the practical utility of the proposed method.\n\n**Weaknesses & Concerns (Based on limited information):**\n\n* **Prior Requirement:** The reliance on a \"global prior distribution of label values\" is a potential limitation. Obtaining this prior *privately* is explicitly mentioned, which is good, but the cost and feasibility of doing so in real-world scenarios need to be discussed.  If obtaining this prior is difficult or introduces significant utility loss, it weakens the practical impact.\n* **Optimality Definition:** The abstract states optimality \"under a given regression loss function.\" This is a crucial detail.  The paper *must* clearly define what \"optimal\" means in this context (e.g., minimizing expected loss, maximizing utility under a DP constraint).  Optimality is relative, and the paper needs to be precise.\n* **Loss Function Scope:**  How general is this optimality result? Does it hold for all common regression loss functions (e.g., squared error, absolute error, Huber loss)? Or is it specific to a limited set? This needs clarification.\n* **Efficiency of Bin Finding:** The abstract mentions an \"efficient algorithm\" for finding optimal bin values. The efficiency of this algorithm is critical. If it's computationally expensive, it could limit the scalability of the approach.\n* **Comparison to Existing Work:** The abstract doesn't mention any comparison to existing label DP techniques. A strong paper needs to clearly position itself within the existing literature and demonstrate its advantages.\n\n\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe paper has the *potential* to be a strong contribution. The core idea is interesting, and the claimed theoretical results are promising. However, the abstract raises several important questions that need to be addressed in the full paper. The success of this paper hinges on the rigor of the theoretical analysis, the practicality of obtaining the prior, the generality of the optimality result, the efficiency of the bin-finding algorithm, and a thorough comparison to existing methods. Without seeing the full paper and reviewer comments/author responses, it's difficult to make a definitive judgment. However, based solely on the abstract, I lean towards requiring major revisions before acceptance.\n\n\n\nFinal Decision: Reject (pending major revisions - a full review is needed"

The abstract is well-written, clearly outlining the problem, the proposed solution, and the claimed benefits. The keywords are appropriate and reflect the paper’s content. Based on the abstract alone, the work *appears* promising and potentially significant. Let's break down the strengths and potential weaknesses, assuming this is representative of the full paper (since we only have the abstract and no reviewer comments/author responses).\n\n**Strengths (based on abstract):**\n\n* **Important Problem:** Protein design is a fundamental challenge with broad implications.\n* **Novel Approach:** The equivariant translation framework is a potentially significant contribution. Utilizing roto-translation equivariance to maintain geometric consistency during design is a smart idea, particularly given the limitations of existing methods.\n* **Efficiency:** The claim of significantly faster inference compared to autoregressive and diffusion models is a major advantage. Sampling-based methods are notoriously slow, and a faster alternative would be highly valuable. Updating all amino acids in one shot is a clever optimization.\n* **Strong Claims:** The abstract states the model \"outperforms previous state-of-the-art baselines by a large margin\" and achieves \"high fidelity\" in both sequence and structure. This suggests substantial empirical validation.\n* **Technical Soundness (potential):** The mention of a \"trigonometry-aware encoder\" and \"roto-translation equivariant decoder\" suggests a solid grounding in geometric deep learning principles.\n\n**Potential Weaknesses (based on abstract - requiring verification in the full paper):**\n\n* **\"Large Margin\" needs quantification:** The abstract claims superior performance but doesn't provide any metrics. The magnitude of the improvement is critical.\n* **\"High Fidelity\" is vague:**  What metrics are used to assess sequence and structure fidelity?  RMSD, sequence identity, etc., need to be specified.\n* **Context Features:** The abstract mentions \"context features given a priori.\" The nature of these features and how they are obtained/defined is crucial. Are they easily obtainable, or does this require significant pre-processing?\n* **Generalizability:** The abstract mentions \"multiple tasks.\" The diversity and difficulty of these tasks need to be assessed. Is the model limited to specific protein families or design goals?\n* **Lack of Detail:** The abstract is necessarily concise, but more detail on the architecture and training procedure would be helpful.\n\n\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe abstract presents a compelling case for a significant contribution to the field of protein design. The proposed method addresses a key limitation of existing approaches (inference speed) and appears to offer improved performance. However, the strength of the paper hinges on the details of the implementation, the rigor of the experimental evaluation, and the clarity of the results. Without reviewer comments and author responses, it's difficult to assess these aspects. *Assuming* the full paper provides concrete evidence to support the claims made in the abstract (quantified performance improvements, clear definition of context features, robust experimental validation across diverse tasks), this paper would be a strong candidate for acceptance at a top-tier conference.

The core idea – modeling each data point as originating from its own function – is intriguing and potentially impactful. The authors argue FRM subsumes Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) and offers a more flexible approach to modeling noise, particularly relevant in modern machine learning scenarios with complex data and overparameterized models. The initial experimental results in regression and reinforcement learning are promising.\n\nHowever, despite the interesting premise, several concerns prevent me from strongly recommending acceptance to a top-tier conference. My assessment is based on the limited information provided (title, abstract, and implicitly, the existence of reviewer comments and author responses which I don't have access to). Therefore, this review is necessarily based on what *can* be inferred from the abstract alone.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Novelty:** The core idea of FRM is genuinely novel and represents a departure from standard assumptions. This is a significant positive.\n* **Generality:** The claim that FRM subsumes ERM is important. If true, it positions FRM not as a replacement for ERM, but as a generalization, increasing its potential impact.\n* **Connection to Generalization:** The link to understanding generalization in overparameterized regimes is a strong theoretical motivation. This is a hot topic in machine learning, and a framework offering new insights is valuable.\n* **Initial Empirical Results:** The mention of improved performance in regression and RL, even in small experiments, suggests potential practical benefits.\n\n**Weaknesses (based on abstract alone):**\n\n* **Lack of Specificity:** The abstract is quite high-level. What *specifically* does \"modeling each data point as coming from its own function\" entail? What is the functional form of these individual functions ($f_{\\theta_i}$)? How are they parameterized? The abstract doesn't provide enough detail to understand the practical implementation of FRM.\n* **Scalability Concerns:** The abstract mentions \"scalable training objectives,\" but doesn't elaborate. A key challenge for any new learning framework is scalability. Without details on how FRM addresses this, it's difficult to assess its practicality.\n* **Nature of Noise:** The claim of handling \"more realistic noise processes\" is vague. What types of noise are better handled by FRM compared to existing methods? Concrete examples would strengthen this claim.\n* **Limited Experimental Validation:** \"Small experiments\" are a red flag for a top-tier conference. While initial results are encouraging, more extensive and rigorous evaluation is needed to demonstrate the effectiveness of FRM. The abstract doesn't mention the datasets used, the baselines compared against, or the statistical significance of the results.\n* **Theoretical Depth:** While the connection to generalization is mentioned, the abstract doesn't provide any details about the theoretical analysis supporting FRM. A strong theoretical foundation is crucial for a novel framework like this.\n\n\n\n**Overall:**\n\nThe paper presents an interesting idea with potential. However, the abstract lacks the necessary detail and rigor expected of a top-tier conference publication. The claims are broad, and the experimental validation appears limited.

The core idea – that *how* we present labels to a model can significantly influence learning – is interesting and potentially impactful. The reported benefits – improved accuracy, robustness to limited data, and performance on challenging problems – are also appealing. However, a careful evaluation reveals several concerns that, in their current form, prevent this paper from reaching the standards of a top-tier conference.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Novelty:** The Binary Label representation is a relatively novel approach to label encoding. While embedding labels isn't new, representing them as large binary vectors is a distinct idea.\n* **Empirical Results:** The paper claims improvements across various datasets and architectures. This breadth of experimentation is a positive sign. The reported gains in low-data regimes are particularly noteworthy.\n* **Clear Motivation:** The paper clearly articulates the motivation behind exploring alternative label representations – the potential to provide richer information to the model.\n\n**Weaknesses & Concerns:**\n\n* **Lack of Theoretical Justification:** The paper lacks a strong theoretical underpinning for *why* Binary Labels should work. What is the intuition behind this representation? Why does a large binary vector provide a benefit over a one-hot encoding? Without a theoretical explanation, the approach feels somewhat ad-hoc. The paper needs to move beyond simply *showing* it works to *explaining* why it works.\n* **Binary Label Construction:** The paper doesn't detail *how* the Binary Labels are constructed. Is there a principled way to assign binary values, or is it arbitrary? The method of construction could significantly impact performance, and this needs to be clearly explained and justified. Is it simply a random assignment, or is there some structure to the binary vectors?\n* **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** The paper doesn't discuss the sensitivity of the results to hyperparameters, particularly those related to the multi-task learning setup (e.g., weighting of the two tasks). It's crucial to demonstrate that the observed improvements aren't simply due to carefully tuned hyperparameters.\n* **Comparison to Existing Methods:** While the paper compares against standard one-hot encoding, it doesn't adequately compare to other label embedding techniques or related work in representation learning. A more thorough comparison to relevant baselines is needed. For example, have they considered learned embeddings for labels?\n* **Limited Ablation Studies:** The paper would benefit from more detailed ablation studies. For example, what happens if the Binary Label task is removed entirely? What is the impact of the size of the binary vector? These studies would help isolate the contribution of each component.\n* **Presentation:** The abstract is somewhat vague. Phrases like \"many advantages\" and \"much more effective\" lack specificity. The paper needs to be more precise in its claims.\n\n\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe paper presents an interesting idea with promising empirical results. However, the lack of theoretical justification, insufficient detail regarding the Binary Label construction, and limited analysis of hyperparameter sensitivity and comparison to related work are significant weaknesses. While the results are encouraging, they are not yet convincing enough to warrant acceptance at a top-tier conference. The paper needs substantial revision to address these concerns. Specifically, the authors need to provide a stronger theoretical foundation, a detailed explanation of the Binary Label construction process, and a more comprehensive experimental evaluation.\n\n\n\nFinal Deci"

The abstract clearly articulates the problem, the proposed solution (DeepSeaProbLog), and the contributions.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Important Problem:** The restriction to discrete domains *is* a major limitation of current NPLP approaches like DeepProbLog. Addressing this is a valuable contribution.\n* **Clear Contributions:** The paper identifies three clear contributions: a new language (DeepSeaProbLog), its semantics, an implementation, and an experimental evaluation. This structure is good.\n* **Potential Impact:** Successfully extending NPLP to continuous domains could significantly broaden the applicability of this promising neuro-symbolic approach.\n* **Well-defined Scope:** The paper focuses on a specific, well-defined extension to existing NPLP frameworks, rather than attempting a complete overhaul.\n\n**Weaknesses (based on abstract alone - lacking reviewer comments and author responses):**\n\n* **Implementation Details Missing:** The abstract mentions an implementation, but provides no details about *how* continuous variables are handled. This is crucial. Is it through approximations? Specific neural network architectures? This is the core technical challenge and needs to be highlighted.\n* **Experimental Evaluation Vague:** The abstract states an \"experimental evaluation\" but doesn't mention *what* was evaluated, *on what datasets*, or *compared to what baselines*.  A top-tier conference requires concrete results, not just a statement that experiments were conducted.  The lack of specifics is concerning.\n* **Semantic Complexity:** Integrating continuous variables into probabilistic logic programming is not trivial. The semantics of DeepSeaProbLog are likely complex, and the abstract doesn't give any indication of how this complexity is managed or addressed.\n* **Scalability:** Continuous domains can be significantly larger and more complex than discrete ones.

Phase transitions are fundamental to understanding the limits of performance.\n* **Potential Novelty:** The claim of precisely identifying phase transition thresholds, rather than just characterizing convergence, *if true*, is a significant advance.\n* **Message Passing Approach:** Utilizing message passing is a reasonable approach given its success in related problems.\n* **Empirical Validation:** The inclusion of numerical experiments to validate the theoretical findings is a positive sign.\n\n**Weaknesses & Concerns:**\n\n* **Lack of Keywords:** The absence of keywords is a minor but noticeable omission. It hinders discoverability.\n* **Notation & Clarity:** The abstract uses a lot of notation without sufficient explanation. While standard to some in the field, a top-tier conference paper needs to be accessible to a broader audience *within* the relevant field.  The use of \"${\\mathbf{\\Pi}}^{\\natural}$\" is particularly unclear without context.  What does the \"natural\" superscript signify?\n* **Vague Claims:** The abstract states \"precise identification\" but doesn't hint at *how* this precision is achieved. What new techniques or insights are used in the message passing algorithm to achieve this?  The phrase \"depending on whether the signal ${\\mathbf{B}}^{\\natural}$ is known or not\" is also a bit weak. This is a natural distinction, but the abstract doesn't convey why this impacts the threshold identification in a novel way.\n* **Missing Related Work Discussion:** The abstract mentions existing work only to contrast it. A strong paper would briefly highlight *specific* limitations of existing work that this paper overcomes. What are the shortcomings of previous convergence rate analyses that motivate this precise threshold identification?\n* **No Mention of Assumptions:** Phase transitions are highly sensitive to assumptions about the data distribution (e.g., sparsity of B, distribution of noise). The abstract is silent on these crucial aspects.\n* **Limited Abstract Information:** The abstract is quite dense with notation and lacks a clear, high-level takeaway. It's difficult to quickly grasp the core innovation and its significance.\n\n\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe paper addresses an important problem and *potentially* offers a significant contribution. However, the abstract is insufficient to convincingly demonstrate the novelty and rigor required for a top-tier conference. The lack of clarity, missing details about the methodology, and absence of a strong connection to existing work raise serious concerns.  Without seeing the full paper and reviewer comments, it's difficult to make a definitive judgment. However, based solely on the abstract, the paper appears to be incomplete and lacking the polish expected of a top-tier publication. It needs to clearly articulate its contributions, provide sufficient context, and demonstrate a thorough understanding of the related literature.\n\n\n\nFinal Deci"

      "response": "## Reviewer Analysis\n\nThis paper tackles an important and increasingly relevant problem: adaptation to distributional shift, specifically the combined challenge of label-shift *and* conditional-shift in an online learning setting. The motivation is sound – real-world deployments almost certainly encounter both types of shift simultaneously, and existing work (specifically cited, Wu et al. 2021) hasn’t addressed this combination. The abstract clearly states the problem, the proposed approach (learning hyperparameters for conditional shift alongside adaptation to label shift), and the empirical evaluation strategy.\n\nHowever, the provided information is *extremely* limited. The abstract is the sole source of information. A strong evaluation requires access to the full paper to assess several critical aspects. Based *solely* on the abstract, several concerns arise.\n\n**Strengths (based on the abstract):**\n\n* **Relevance:** The problem is highly relevant to the machine learning community, particularly those working on deployment and continual learning.\n* **Novelty (Potential):** Addressing the combined label and conditional shift in an online setting *could* be novel, assuming the approach is genuinely different from simply applying existing conditional-shift adaptation techniques after initial label-shift correction.\n* **Empirical Evaluation:** The use of both synthetic and real datasets is a positive sign, suggesting a desire for robustness. The inclusion of both classification and regression tasks is also good.\n\n**Weaknesses (based on the abstract - and significant concerns):**\n\n* **Lack of Technical Detail:** The abstract is *very* vague. What does \"learning additional hyper-parameters\" actually *mean*? What specific method is used? Is it a Bayesian approach as suggested by the keywords, and if so, how? The lack of detail makes it impossible to assess the technical contribution.\n* **\"Appropriate validation sets\" is insufficient:** Simply stating that using \"appropriate validation sets\" helps isn't a contribution. The paper *must* detail how these validation sets are constructed and maintained in an online setting, especially given the combined shifts. How are they representative of the current distribution? How is the validation set updated?\n* **Empirical Rigor Unknown:** While datasets are mentioned, the abstract doesn't indicate the *extent* of the empirical evaluation. How many baselines are compared against? Are the results statistically significant? What metrics are used?  The phrase \"improve performance\" is weak without quantification.\n* **Connection to Wu et al. (2021) unclear:** The abstract mentions Wu et al. (2021) but doesn't clearly articulate *how* this work extends or differs from it. Is it a direct adaptation of their method? A completely new approach? This needs to be explicitly stated.\n* **Black-box adaptation:** The term \"black-box\" is used, which suggests the method doesn't require access to the model internals. While this can be a strength, it also raises questions about the potential for more effective, model-specific adaptation techniques. The justification for a black-box approach needs to be stronger.\n\n\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nBased on the abstract alone, this paper feels like a preliminary investigation rather than a fully-fledged conference contribution. It identifies a relevant problem and suggests a potential direction, but lacks the technical depth and empirical rigor expected of a top-tier conference. The abstract reads more like a project proposal than a completed research paper. Without the full paper, it's impossible to determine if the \"learning additional hyper-parameters\" is a genuinely novel and effective technique, or simply a trivial extension of existing methods. The lack of detail regarding the validation set strategy is a major red flag.\n\n\n\nFinal Deci"

      "response": "## Reviewer Analysis: RuDar: Weather Radar Dataset for Precipitation Nowcasting with Geographical and Seasonal Variability\n\nThis paper presents RuDar, a new weather radar dataset for precipitation nowcasting, focusing on 3D radar echo observations across a geographically and climatically diverse region of Russia. The core contribution is the inclusion of vertical reflectivity profiles, addressing a limitation of existing datasets which primarily offer single-level or aggregated data. The dataset is substantial (50,000 timestamps, 100GB) and includes valuable ancillary information like orography. The authors also provide baseline evaluations and uncertainty quantification analysis, alongside public release of both data and code.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Novelty & Importance:** The inclusion of 3D radar data is a significant contribution. Existing precipitation nowcasting datasets often lack this crucial vertical dimension, hindering the development of more physically informed and accurate models. The geographical coverage (European Russia) and the inclusion of diverse climate zones are also valuable.\n* **Dataset Size & Quality:** 50,000 timestamps over two years is a respectable size for a radar dataset, and the 2km spatial resolution is reasonable. The inclusion of reflectivity, radial velocity, and precipitation intensity at multiple altitudes is a strong point.\n* **Baseline Evaluation:** The authors demonstrate the usability of the dataset by evaluating several baseline models. While the results aren't the primary focus (as it's a dataset paper), showing *some* performance on the data is important. The uncertainty quantification aspect is a nice addition.\n* **Public Availability:**  The public release of both the dataset and code is crucial for reproducibility and encourages further research. This is a key requirement for a top-tier conference.\n* **Clear Presentation:** The abstract is well-written and clearly articulates the problem, the proposed solution (the dataset), and the key contributions.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Baseline Depth:** The baseline evaluations are somewhat limited. While optical flow and neural networks are reasonable starting points, a more thorough comparison against state-of-the-art precipitation nowcasting models (e.g., those leveraging convolutional LSTMs, transformers, or physics-informed approaches) would strengthen the paper.  The abstract mentions evaluation, but the extent isn't clear.\n* **Analysis of Geographical/Seasonal Variability:** The abstract highlights geographical and seasonal variability as a key feature of the dataset. However, the paper description doesn't detail *how* this variability is analyzed or exploited in the baseline evaluations.  Is there a discussion of performance differences across different regions or seasons? This is a missed opportunity.\n* **Data Documentation:** While the data is publicly available, the paper doesn't provide details on the data format, potential data quality issues (e.g., missing data, calibration errors), or recommended data pre-processing steps.  A more detailed data documentation section would be beneficial.\n* **Limited Discussion of Potential Biases:** Radar data can be susceptible to various biases (e.g., beam blockage, ground clutter). The paper doesn't address these potential issues or discuss how they might affect model performance.\n\n\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThis paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of precipitation nowcasting. The RuDar dataset addresses a significant gap in available resources and has the potential to facilitate advancements in model development. While the baseline evaluations could be more comprehensive and the analysis of geographical/seasonal variability could be more in-depth, the strengths of the paper – particularly the novelty of the dataset, its size, and its public availability – outweigh the weaknesses.  For a top-tier conference, the baseline section needs to be strengthened, and a more detailed discussion of the dataset's characteristics (including potential biases) is needed. However, the core contribution is strong enough to warrant acceptance with minor revisions.\n\n\n\nFinal Deci"
