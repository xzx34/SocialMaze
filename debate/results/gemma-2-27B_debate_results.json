      "response": "## Analysis\n\nThis paper presents NORML, a novel meta-learning framework that utilizes an LSTM-based meta-learner to optimize the learning process of a base learner for few-shot learning tasks. While the idea of using a meta-learner to guide parameter updates is not entirely new, the authors propose a specific architecture and approach that aims to address the scalability issues faced by some existing methods.\n\nHowever, several concerns arise from the reviewer comments and the paper itself:\n\n**1. Limited Novelty and Insufficient Comparison:**\n\n* The reviewers point out that NORML shares similarities with the Meta-Learner LSTM (Ravi & Larochelle) and lacks a direct, fair comparison. \n* The authors claim NORML's advantage lies in its scalability, but the paper doesn't convincingly demonstrate this through experiments.\n* The comparison with MAML is limited, and crucial baselines like MAML++ and a version of MAML with per-unit learning rates are missing.\n\n**2. Limited Applicability:**\n\n* NORML's focus on fully connected networks restricts its applicability to a narrower range of tasks compared to methods that can handle convolutional networks.\n\n**3. Inaccuracies in Related Work:**\n\n* The paper contains inaccuracies regarding the scaling properties of previous methods like Meta-Learner LSTM and Andrychowicz et al., which weakens the argument for NORML's novelty.\n\n**4. Writing and Clarity Issues:**\n\n* Reviewers highlight numerous grammatical errors and inconsistencies in citations, indicating a need for significant revision.\n* The writing style is overly complex and could benefit from simplification for better clarity.\n\n**5. Missing Information:**\n\n* The paper lacks details about whether gradients are propagated into the base learner gradients, leaving a gap in understanding the method's implementation.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nWhile the paper presents an interesting idea, the lack of a thorough comparison with existing methods, limited applicability, inaccuracies in the related work section, and writing issues raise serious concerns about its suitability for publication at a top-tier conference.\n\n**Final Decision: Reject**"

While the proposed idea of using a meta-MCTS to control episode generation in reinforcement learning has potential merit, the current submission is far from publishable in a top-tier conference. \n\nHere's a breakdown of the reasons:\n\n* **Poor Writing Quality:** All three reviewers unanimously criticized the paper's writing quality. The abstract is unclear, sentences are grammatically incorrect, and the overall presentation is disorganized and difficult to follow. This makes it challenging to understand the authors' contributions and evaluate the paper's scientific merit.\n\n* **Lack of References:** The absence of any references is a serious issue. It suggests a lack of engagement with existing literature and raises concerns about the originality and novelty of the proposed approach.\n\n* **Insufficient Detail:** The paper lacks sufficient detail about the proposed method. The description is vague, and the algorithm boxes are difficult to understand. This makes it impossible to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach.\n\n* **Unclear Contribution:** The paper fails to clearly articulate its contribution to the field. While the abstract mentions \"robust performance\" compared to AlphaZero, no concrete evidence or experimental results are presented to support this claim.\n\n* **Author Response:** The author's response acknowledges the shortcomings of the paper but does not offer concrete plans for improvement. The focus on financial constraints and lack of familiarity with .bib files does not address the fundamental issues with the paper's content and presentation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nFinal Decision: **Reject** \n\n\nThe paper requires substantial revisions in terms of writing quality, clarity, referencing, and methodological detail before it can be considered for publication in a top-tier conference. The authors should focus on addressing the reviewers' concerns and providing a more comprehensive and convincing presentation of their work."

Exploring other tasks and datasets would strengthen the paper.\n* **Assumptions:** While the authors argue against the assumption of knowing the specific OOD distribution, the reliance on a pre-defined set of corruptions for calibration might be seen as a limitation.\n\n**Addressing Reviewer Concerns:**\n\nThe authors have addressed many of the reviewers' concerns in their rebuttal, particularly regarding the distinction between unsupervised domain adaptation and calibration under distribution shift. The additional experiments on completely OOD datasets are also a valuable addition.\n\n**Final Decision:**\n\n**Final Decision: Accept**\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nWhile there are some limitations, the paper presents a novel and effective approach to calibration under distribution shift. The simplicity and effectiveness of the proposed methods make them potentially valuable contributions to the field. Further exploration of the method's limitations and broader applicability would strengthen the work."

While the concept is interesting and the experimental results on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 are promising, several concerns raised by the reviewers need to be addressed.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Novelty:** The idea of collaboratively training robust models using different adversarial training methods is novel and potentially valuable.\n* **Empirical Results:** CAT achieves state-of-the-art robustness on CIFAR-10 under the Auto-Attack benchmark without using additional data.\n* **Clarity:** The paper is well-written and easy to understand.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Lack of Theoretical Analysis:** The paper lacks a theoretical justification for why CAT improves robustness. The reviewers rightly point out the need for a deeper understanding of why combining different adversarial training methods leads to better performance.\n* **Computational Cost:** Training two robust models simultaneously doubles the computational cost and memory overhead compared to traditional adversarial training methods. This is a significant drawback, especially for larger datasets and models.\n* **Limited Scope:** The experiments are limited to CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets and a small set of network architectures. Evaluating CAT on larger datasets and diverse architectures is crucial to demonstrate its generalizability.\n* **Missing Baselines:** The paper lacks comparison with several important baselines, including recent and stronger adversarial training methods. This makes it difficult to assess the true effectiveness of CAT.\n* **Insufficient Ablation Studies:** The paper lacks comprehensive ablation studies to investigate the impact of different design choices in CAT. For example, exploring the effect of using more than two adversarial training methods or varying the number of training epochs for each model would provide valuable insights.\n\n**Reviewer Comments:**\n\nThe reviewers raise valid concerns about the novelty, theoretical grounding, computational cost, and empirical evaluation of CAT. They also suggest several important experiments and analyses that could strengthen the paper.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nBased on the strengths and weaknesses of the paper and the reviewers' comments, I recommend **Rejecting** this paper for publication at a top-tier conference.\n\nWhile the idea of CAT is interesting and the initial results are promising, the paper requires significant revisions to address the concerns raised by the reviewers. Specifically, the authors need to:\n\n* Provide a theoretical analysis of why CAT improves robustness.\n* Conduct more extensive experiments on larger datasets and diverse architectures.\n* Include comparisons with a wider range of baselines, including recent and stronger adversarial training methods.\n* Perform comprehensive ablation studies to investigate the impact of different design choices in CAT.\n* Address the computational cost concerns by exploring more efficient implementations of CAT.\n\nOnce these issues are addressed, the paper could be resubmitted to a conference or journal."

The core idea of using a bi-objective optimization model to balance skill level and play style diversity is novel and potentially valuable. The empirical results on Pong and Justice Online are promising, showing that the proposed BiO algorithm can outperform other baselines in terms of both win rate and diversity of play styles.\n\nHowever, there are several weaknesses that prevent me from recommending a clear acceptance:\n\n* **Missing Key Baselines:** The paper fails to compare BiO against quality-diversity algorithms, which are specifically designed to address the challenge of generating diverse agents. This omission makes it difficult to assess the true novelty and effectiveness of the proposed approach.\n* **Limited Scope of Evaluation:** While the results on Pong and Justice Online are encouraging, evaluating the algorithm on only two games is insufficient to demonstrate its generalizability. Including additional benchmark domains, especially those with more complex action spaces and diverse play styles, would strengthen the paper's claims.\n* **Lack of Clarity on Play Style Representation:** Reducing play style to a single scalar is a significant simplification. While the paper acknowledges this limitation, it doesn't offer a compelling justification for this choice or discuss potential alternatives. A more nuanced representation of play style would enhance the algorithm's ability to capture diverse behaviors.\n* **Insufficient Experimental Details:** Some aspects of the experimental setup, such as the opponent selection process in RQ3 and the specific metrics used to evaluate play style diversity, lack clarity. Providing more detailed information would improve the reproducibility and interpretability of the results.\n\n**Reviewer Concerns:**\n\nThe reviewers raise valid concerns regarding the lack of comparison to quality-diversity algorithms, the limited scope of evaluation, and the need for more detailed experimental information. These concerns align with my own assessment of the paper's weaknesses.\n\n## Final Decision: Reject\n\nWhile the paper presents a promising approach to encourage diverse playing styles in self-play RL, the lack of key baselines, limited scope of evaluation, and insufficient experimental details prevent me from recommending its acceptance. Addressing these weaknesses would significantly strengthen the paper and make it more suitable for publication."

      "response": "## Analysis\n\nThis paper presents a novel and potentially impactful framework for machine learning called Functional Risk Minimization (FRM). It challenges the traditional Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) paradigm by proposing a new way to model noise and learn from data.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Novelty:** FRM introduces a fresh perspective on noise modeling and learning objectives. It moves away from the traditional additive noise assumption and proposes a framework where each data point is associated with its own function. This is a significant departure from existing methods and has the potential to improve performance in various settings.\n* **Potential Impact:** The paper argues that FRM could be more suitable for real-world data where variations are often structured. The new experiments on MNIST variants support this claim, showing that FRM can learn better representations when data exhibits structured variations.\n* **Theoretical Foundation:** While the paper focuses on the practical aspects of FRM, it also provides some theoretical grounding for the proposed framework. The connection to ERM for specific loss functions and the discussion on the relationship with over-parameterized models are valuable contributions.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Scalability:** While the authors address scalability concerns in the revised version, the current implementation of FRM is still computationally expensive, especially for large models. The paper acknowledges this limitation and suggests future work on improving the efficiency of FRM.\n* **Clarity:** Some parts of the paper could benefit from clearer explanations. For example, the relationship between FRM and Bayesian learning could be further clarified.\n\n**Reviewer Concerns:**\n\nThe reviewers raised valid concerns about the paper's clarity, scalability, and the lack of a strong theoretical justification for when FRM outperforms ERM.

The authors have demonstrated the feasibility of FRM and its potential benefits in specific settings. Further research is needed to address the scalability issue and provide a more comprehensive theoretical analysis. However, the paper's contributions are significant enough to warrant publication."
