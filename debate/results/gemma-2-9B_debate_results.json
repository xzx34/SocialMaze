      "response": "## Analysis\n\nThis paper proposes NORML, a novel meta-learning framework that utilizes an LSTM to perform neuron-wise optimization on a learner network for efficient few-shot learning. While the idea of using an LSTM to guide parameter updates is interesting, several critical issues prevent this paper from being suitable for publication in a top-tier conference.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Novelty:** NORML introduces a unique approach to meta-learning by employing an LSTM to control parameter updates at the neuron level. This differs from traditional meta-learning methods that often focus on learning a global learning rate or updating entire layers.\n* **Scalability:** The authors claim that NORML scales better than previous methods due to its linear increase in meta-learner parameters with respect to the learner network size. This addresses a key challenge in scaling meta-learning to large models.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Limited Novelty and Comparison:** The core idea of using an LSTM for meta-learning is not entirely novel. The paper acknowledges related work by Ravi & Larochelle (2017) but fails to provide a thorough and fair comparison. The authors claim NORML is superior due to its increased parameter count, but this claim lacks strong empirical support. A direct comparison with Ravi & Larochelle's method using the same experimental setup is crucial.\n* **Missing Baselines:** The paper lacks a comprehensive set of baselines. While it compares NORML to MAML, the chosen MAML variants are not representative of the state-of-the-art. Comparisons with MAML++ (Antoniou et al.) and a version of MAML with per-unit and per-step learning rates are essential for a meaningful evaluation.\n* **Limited Applicability:** NORML's reliance on fully connected networks severely limits its applicability. Most modern few-shot learning methods utilize convolutional networks, making this a significant drawback.\n* **Inaccurate Descriptions of Prior Work:** The paper contains inaccuracies regarding previous work, particularly regarding the parameter scaling and architecture of Meta-Learner LSTM and Andrychowicz et al.'s method. These inaccuracies undermine the paper's credibility.\n* **Weak Experimental Evaluation:** The experimental results are not convincing. The authors do not provide results for Meta-Learner LSTM on miniImageNet using a comparable base learner, and the Omniglot results lack a convolutional network baseline. Additionally, the absence of confidence intervals in Table 2 weakens the statistical significance of the findings.\n* **Writing Quality:** The writing quality is subpar, with numerous grammatical errors and inconsistencies in citation style. This detracts from the paper's overall clarity and professionalism.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nDespite the intriguing idea behind NORML, the paper suffers from significant shortcomings. The lack of a thorough comparison with related work, missing baselines, limited applicability, inaccuracies regarding prior work, weak experimental evaluation, and poor writing quality prevent it from meeting the standards of a top-tier conference.\n\n\nFinal Decision: Reject \n"

While the core idea is interesting and potentially impactful, the paper suffers from several weaknesses that prevent it from being accepted at a top-tier conference:\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Novelty:** MuPPET introduces a new dynamic precision switching mechanism that goes beyond existing static approaches.\n* **Potential Impact:** The ability to train at lower precisions with minimal accuracy loss could significantly improve training speed and efficiency.\n* **Empirical Evaluation:** The paper provides experimental results on several architectures and datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of MuPPET in reducing training time.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Lack of Clarity and Rigor:** The description of the precision switching mechanism and the quantization scheme is not clear and lacks sufficient detail for reproducibility. The authors need to provide a more thorough explanation of how the quantization levels are chosen and how the scaling factors are determined.\n* **Insufficient Justification:** The rationale behind the chosen gradient diversity metric and the specific parameters (p, threshold) is not well-articulated. The authors need to provide a stronger theoretical justification for these choices and explore their impact on performance.\n* **Limited Scope:** The paper focuses primarily on speedup and does not delve deeply into the potential benefits of MuPPET for other aspects like memory efficiency or energy consumption.\n* **Weak Comparison:** The comparison with existing methods is limited and lacks a comprehensive analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches.\n* **Minor Issues:** The paper contains several minor issues like typos, unclear notation, and readability problems in figures.\n\n**Addressing Reviewer Comments:**\n\nThe authors have addressed some of the reviewer comments in their response, but several key issues remain unresolved. For example, the justification for the gradient diversity metric and the choice of parameters still lacks clarity. The authors need to provide a more convincing argument for the effectiveness of their approach.\n\n## Final Decision: Reject\n\n\nWhile MuPPET presents an interesting idea, the current paper lacks the clarity, rigor, and depth required for acceptance at a top-tier conference. The authors need to significantly improve the presentation, justification, and analysis of their work before it is ready for publication."

However, the paper suffers from severe shortcomings that prevent it from meeting the standards of a top-tier conference. \n\nHere's a breakdown:\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Novel Idea:** The concept of using a meta-MCTS to guide episode generation in reinforcement learning is interesting and potentially valuable.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Lack of Clarity and Writing Quality:** All three reviewers highlight the paper's extremely poor writing quality. Sentences are grammatically incorrect, the abstract is incomprehensible, and the overall flow of ideas is unclear. This makes it difficult to understand the proposed method and its implications.\n* **Insufficient Background and Related Work:** The paper lacks any references to previous research, making it impossible to assess the novelty and contribution of the work.  Reviewer 1 explicitly states this as a major issue.\n* **Limited Experimental Evaluation:** The paper mentions experiments on a \"small problem\" but provides no details about the problem, the experimental setup, or the results. Without concrete evidence of the method's effectiveness, it's impossible to evaluate its merit.\n* **Unprofessional Presentation:** The paper's formatting is inconsistent, with excessive blank space and poorly designed algorithm boxes. This unprofessional presentation further detracts from its credibility.\n\n**Author Response:**\n\nThe author's response acknowledges the writing issues and lack of references but offers no concrete plans for improvement. The claim of finding similar work in their country without international publications doesn't address the lack of cited literature in the paper itself.\n\n## Final Decision: Reject \n\n\nThe paper's severe shortcomings in writing quality, lack of background and related work, limited experimental evaluation, and unprofessional presentation make it unsuitable for publication in a top-tier conference.  The authors need to significantly revise the paper, addressing all of these issues, before it could be considered for publication. \n"

      "response": "##  Analysis of Paper: PROGRESSIVE LEARNING AND DISENTANGLEMENT OF HIERARCHICAL REPRESENTATIONS\n\nThis paper proposes a novel approach called pro-VLAE, an extension to the variational ladder autoencoder (VLAE) that progressively learns hierarchical representations. The authors argue that this progressive learning strategy helps disentanglement.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Novelty:** The paper introduces a novel approach to disentanglement by progressively learning hierarchical representations. This is a fresh perspective on disentanglement, building upon existing VLAE architectures.\n* **Experimental Design:** The authors conduct experiments on two benchmark datasets and provide quantitative and qualitative results. They also compare their method with existing methods and provide ablation studies.\n* **Clarity:** The paper is well-written and easy to understand. The authors clearly explain their approach and the rationale behind it.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Clarity of the relationship between hierarchical representation and disentanglement: The paper's core argument is that progressive learning of hierarchical representations leads to better disentanglement. However, the connection between these two concepts is not clearly articulated. The authors need to provide a more concrete explanation of how hierarchical representation leads to better disentanglement.\n* **Ablation studies: While the authors conduct ablation studies, they are limited in scope. More comprehensive ablation studies are needed to better understand the impact of individual components of the proposed method.\n* **Comparison with state-of-the-art: The paper lacks a thorough comparison with state-of-the-art methods. The authors should provide a more comprehensive comparison with recent works on disentanglement.\n* **Metric: The proposed metric for disentanglement is dependent on ground truth factors, limiting its practical applicability. The authors should discuss the limitations of their metric and explore alternative metrics.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe paper presents a novel approach to disentanglement by leveraging hierarchical representations. However, the connection between hierarchical representation and disentanglement needs further clarification. The paper also lacks a comprehensive comparison with state-of-the-art methods and a thorough ablation study. The metric's reliance on ground truth factors limits its practical applicability.\n\n**Final Decision: Reject\n\n\n\n"

      "response": "## Reasoning:\n\nThis paper proposes MALCOM, a novel out-of-distribution (OOD) detection method that leverages normalized compression distance (NCD) to capture spatial patterns in feature maps. While the idea is interesting and the authors demonstrate its effectiveness in various settings, several concerns remain:\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Novelty:** MALCOM introduces a unique approach to OOD detection by incorporating NCD, which offers a different perspective compared to traditional methods relying on Mahalanobis distance or energy-based approaches.\n* **Practicality:** The method addresses the practical constraint of not requiring retraining or OOD data for validation, making it more applicable to real-world scenarios.\n* **Experimental Evaluation:** The authors conduct extensive experiments on multiple datasets and architectures, providing a comprehensive evaluation of MALCOM's performance.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Justification for Constraints:** The paper's main contribution stems from its strict constraints (no OOD data for validation, no model retraining). However, the justification for these constraints feels weak. While the authors mention the impracticality of retraining in deployed systems, they don't convincingly argue why OOD data for validation is always unavailable. This lack of clarity weakens the significance of the proposed method's practical advantage.\n* **Comparison with Unconstrained Methods:** The paper primarily compares MALCOM to methods that also adhere to the strict constraints. A comparison with unconstrained methods would provide a more complete picture of MALCOM's performance and relative standing within the OOD detection landscape.\n* **Ablation Study:** While the authors address the reviewer's suggestion for an ablation study on weighted averaging, the study lacks depth. A more thorough analysis of the individual components of MALCOM and their contributions to performance would strengthen the paper's argument for the method's effectiveness.\n* **Theoretical Guarantees:** The paper lacks theoretical guarantees regarding the exhaustiveness of the proposed method in detecting all possible OOD examples. Providing some theoretical insights into the limitations and potential biases of the NCD-based approach would enhance the paper's rigor.\n\n**Reviewer Feedback:**\n\nThe reviewers raise valid points about the paper's justification for the strict constraints, the need for comparison with unconstrained methods, and the lack of theoretical guarantees. The authors' responses acknowledge these concerns but offer only partial solutions.\n\n\n## Final Decision: Reject\n\n\nWhile MALCOM presents an interesting idea and demonstrates promising results, the paper's weaknesses outweigh its strengths. The lack of a strong justification for the strict constraints, the limited comparison with unconstrained methods, and the absence of theoretical guarantees prevent the paper from being accepted at this time. The authors should address these concerns in a revised submission. \n"

      "response": "## Reasoning:\n\nThis paper tackles an important and timely question in deep learning theory: how do different activation functions affect the training of overparameterized neural networks? The authors make a significant contribution by providing a theoretical analysis of the impact of activation function smoothness on the minimum eigenvalue of the NTK matrix, which is crucial for understanding the convergence rate of training. \n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Novel and relevant contribution:** The paper addresses a gap in the literature by providing a comprehensive analysis of the impact of activation function smoothness on training dynamics.\n* **Rigorous theoretical analysis:** The authors employ a solid theoretical framework and provide detailed proofs for their claims. While the appendix is lengthy, it appears to contain complete and well-structured proofs.\n* **Clear and concise writing:** The paper is well-written and easy to follow, even for readers unfamiliar with the intricacies of deep learning theory.\n* **Empirical validation:** The authors support their theoretical findings with experiments on synthetic data and a real-world dataset (CIFAR-10), demonstrating the practical relevance of their results.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Length and organization:** As noted by the reviewers, the paper is quite long, and the appendix could be better organized. While the authors have taken steps to address this in their response, further improvements could be made to enhance readability and accessibility.\n* **Limited scope:** The analysis focuses primarily on two-layer networks with only the input layer trained. While this simplification allows for a clearer presentation of the main ideas, extending the results to deeper networks and other training scenarios would strengthen the paper's impact.\n* **Gap between theory and experiment:** The authors acknowledge a discrepancy between their theoretical predictions and empirical observations on CIFAR-10. Further investigation into this gap and potential explanations would be beneficial.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nDespite its weaknesses, this paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of deep learning theory. The authors have conducted a thorough and insightful analysis of the impact of activation functions on training dynamics, providing both theoretical insights and empirical validation. With some revisions to address the length and organization issues, and further exploration of the gap between theory and experiment, this paper has the potential to be a significant contribution to the literature.\n\n\n**Final Decision: Accept** \n"

While the core idea of leveraging multiple instance learning (MIL) for this task is promising, several significant weaknesses prevent it from being accepted at a top-tier conference.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Novelty:** The application of MIL to trajectory segmentation with weak supervision is novel and addresses a relevant problem in robotics.\n* **Conceptual Clarity:** The paper clearly defines the problem and the proposed solution.\n* **Experimental Setup:** The authors conduct experiments across diverse environments and tasks, demonstrating the potential applicability of their method.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Limited Novelty:** As pointed out by Reviewer 2, the specific pooling technique used (log-sum-exp) is not novel and has been successfully applied in other domains.\n* **Weak Empirical Results:** The reported accuracy scores are underwhelming, particularly considering the weak supervision setting. The authors acknowledge the ambiguity in some trajectories, but this doesn't fully explain the low performance.\n* **Lack of Strong Baselines:** The comparison with other weakly-supervised methods is insufficient. As suggested by Reviewer 3, comparisons with unsupervised clustering methods and a fully-supervised oracle would provide a more comprehensive evaluation.\n* **Insufficient Analysis:** The paper lacks in-depth analysis of the segmentation results. Confusion matrices, precision-recall curves, and qualitative visualizations would significantly improve the understanding of the method's strengths and weaknesses.\n* **Limited Discussion of Practical Implications:** The authors claim that the learned skills can be reused for new tasks, but they provide limited evidence to support this claim. More concrete examples and experiments demonstrating zero-shot transfer would strengthen this argument.\n* **Unclear Implementation Details:** The paper lacks sufficient details about the model architecture, hyperparameter tuning, and data preprocessing, making it difficult to reproduce the results.\n\n**Author Response:**\n\nThe author response partially addresses some of the concerns raised by the reviewers. However, it doesn't convincingly address the key issues regarding the novelty, empirical performance, and lack of strong baselines.\n\n\n## Final Decision: Reject \n\n\nThe paper presents an interesting idea but suffers from several critical weaknesses that prevent it from being accepted at a top-tier conference. The authors need to significantly improve the novelty, empirical results, and analysis before resubmitting the paper."

      "response": "## Reasoning:\n\nThis paper presents an interesting application of machine learning to predict DNA folding patterns using ChIP-seq data. While the core idea is novel and potentially impactful, several aspects raise concerns about its suitability for publication in a top-tier conference:\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Novelty:** The focus on predicting DNA folding patterns from ChIP-seq data, rather than directly reconstructing 3D structures, is a unique approach.\n* **Biological Relevance:** The chosen metric (Transitional Gamma) is biologically meaningful and directly relates to the formation of Topologically Associating Domains (TADs).\n* **Model Selection:** The authors explore different machine learning models, including a bidirectional LSTM RNN, and demonstrate its superiority over other approaches.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Limited Novelty:** While the specific application is novel, the use of recurrent neural networks for sequence data is not groundbreaking. The authors need to clearly articulate the unique contributions of their work beyond simply applying a known technique to a new domain.\n* **Lack of Generalizability:** The authors acknowledge the limited generalizability of their findings to other datasets and organisms. This significantly weakens the impact of the research.\n* **Insufficient Evaluation:** The evaluation is primarily based on a single metric (wMSE) and lacks a comprehensive comparison with other relevant baselines. The authors need to provide a more robust evaluation using multiple metrics and a wider range of models.\n* **Data and Methodological Clarity:** The description of the data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training is not sufficiently detailed. This makes it difficult to fully understand and reproduce the results.\n* **Weak Discussion:** The discussion section lacks depth and fails to adequately address the limitations of the study and potential future directions.\n\n**Author Response:**\n\nThe author response partially addresses some of the concerns raised by the reviewers. However, it does not convincingly demonstrate a significant improvement in the paper's quality. The authors acknowledge the limitations but fail to provide concrete solutions or alternative approaches.\n\n\n## Final Decision: Reject \n\n\nWhile the paper presents an interesting idea, its current form is not suitable for publication in a top-tier conference. The lack of novelty, limited generalizability, insufficient evaluation, and unclear methodology significantly detract from its overall quality. The authors should address the reviewers' concerns more thoroughly and provide a more robust and convincing argument for the significance of their work before resubmitting it for consideration."

While the paper makes some interesting contributions, several significant concerns raised by the reviewers warrant a rejection.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Novelty:** The paper explores the convergence of SGD-ascent for WGANs with a one-layer generator, a topic not extensively studied before.\n* **Theoretical Analysis:** The authors provide a theoretical analysis of the convergence of SGD-ascent to global optima for this specific setting.\n* **Sample Complexity:** The paper analyzes the sample complexity of the proposed method and shows it matches the upper bound for learning one-layer networks.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Limited Scope:** The paper focuses on a very specific and simplified setting (one-layer generator, quadratic discriminator) which significantly limits the applicability of the results to the broader WGAN landscape.\n* **Overstated Claims:** The title and abstract suggest a broader analysis of WGANs, while the actual analysis is limited to a very specific case. This creates a misleading impression of the paper's scope.\n* **Justification of the Quadratic Discriminator:** The authors' justification for using a quadratic discriminator is not convincing. While they claim sufficient discriminating power, reviewers rightfully question this claim and the connection to the original WGAN concept.\n* **Lack of Generalizability:** The results are not easily generalizable to more complex discriminator architectures, which are more common in practice.\n* **Overly Simplistic Setting:** The simplified setting (teacher network generating data) is not representative of real-world WGAN applications.\n\n**Reviewer Feedback:**\n\nThe reviewers are largely critical of the paper's limited scope and the justification for the specific discriminator choice. They find the analysis interesting but argue that the simplified setting makes the results less impactful.\n\n**Author Response:**\n\nThe authors' response does not adequately address the core concerns raised by the reviewers. They reiterate their claims without providing convincing arguments or addressing the limitations of their approach.\n\n## Final Decision: **Reject**\n\n\n"

The authors clearly demonstrate the theoretical underpinnings of their results.\n* **Addressing Open Questions:** The work builds upon previous research by Telgarsky and provides a deeper understanding of why deep networks are beneficial for representing certain functions.\n* **Improved Structure:** The authors have addressed Reviewer 3's feedback by restructuring the paper to emphasize the main contribution to ML earlier on.\n* **Additional Materials:** The inclusion of a synthetic dataset, code, and figures in response to Reviewer 2's comments significantly strengthens the paper.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Limited Practical Applicability:** While the theoretical results are strong, the authors acknowledge that the practical application of their findings is limited.

The novel application of Sharkovsky's Theorem and the clear presentation of the results make this a valuable addition to the literature. The authors have also addressed the reviewers' concerns effectively.\n\n\nFinal Decision: Accept \n"

This is a potentially valuable contribution, especially for \"discrete\" data types.\n* **Motivation:** The paper clearly identifies a gap in existing methods and proposes a solution.\n* **Experimental Evaluation:** The paper includes experiments on multiple datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Clarity and Organization:** The paper suffers from significant grammatical errors and a lack of clarity in the presentation. This makes it difficult to fully understand the proposed method.\n* **Related Work:** The paper does not adequately address existing work in the field, particularly Taskonomy, which seems highly relevant.\n* **Experimental Design:** The authors need to provide more details about the experimental setup and the datasets used.\n* **Attention Mechanism:** The paper's contribution of the attention mechanism needs further clarification.\n\n**Reviewer Comments:**\n\n* **Reviewer 1:** Highlights the need for clarity and a more detailed explanation of the \"general task dependency\" and \"data dependency\" distinction.\n* **Reviewer 2:**  Raises concerns about the motivation, the need for a baseline comparison with existing work and the need for more details about the method.\n* **Reviewer 3:**  Points out the lack of novelty and the need for a stronger discussion of related work.\n* **Reviewer 4:**  Critiques the lack of clarity, the lack of a clear distinction from existing work and the need for more details about the method.\n\n**Author Response:**\n\nThe authors have addressed some of the concerns, but the paper still lacks clarity and a thorough discussion of related work.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nWhile the paper presents a potentially interesting idea, the lack of clarity, the lack of a thorough discussion of related work, and the lack of clarity in the method make it difficult to fully evaluate the paper's contribution.\n\n**Final Decision: Reject\n\n\n**\n\n\n\n"

      "response": "## Analysis\n\nThis paper presents a novel idea for refining Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) agents using MCTS itself to guide episode generation. While the core concept holds potential, the paper suffers from severe shortcomings that prevent its acceptance at a top-tier conference. \n\nHere's a breakdown:\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Novel Idea:** The concept of using a meta-MCTS to control episode generation in reinforcement learning is intriguing and could lead to interesting advancements.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Lack of Clarity and Writing Quality:** All three reviewers highlight the paper's extremely poor writing quality. Sentences are grammatically incorrect, the abstract is incomprehensible, and the overall flow of the paper is disjointed. This makes it incredibly difficult to understand the proposed method and its implications.\n* **Absence of Literature Review:** The paper lacks any references to previous work, making it impossible to assess its originality and contribution to the field. This is a fundamental flaw in any academic paper.\n* **Insufficient Experimental Validation:** The paper mentions experiments with a \"small problem\" but provides no details about the problem, the experimental setup, or the results. Without concrete evidence of the method's effectiveness, its claims of robustness and performance improvement remain unsubstantiated.\n* **Unprofessional Presentation:** The paper's formatting is inconsistent, with excessive blank space and poorly designed algorithm boxes. This unprofessional presentation further detracts from its credibility.\n\n**Author Response:**\n\nThe author's response acknowledges the writing issues and lack of references but offers no concrete plans for improvement. The claim of finding similar work in their country without international publications does not address the paper's shortcomings.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nDespite the potential of the underlying idea, the paper's severe flaws in writing, lack of literature review, insufficient experimental validation, and unprofessional presentation make it unsuitable for publication in a top-tier conference.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject \n\n\n"

      "response": "## Reasoning:\n\nThis paper proposes a novel approach to unsupervised domain adaptation called Domain-Adaptive Multibranch Networks (formerly Multi-Flow Networks). The core idea is to allow different domains to utilize different computational paths within a shared network architecture, enabling them to adapt to their specific characteristics. \n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Novelty:** The concept of adaptive computation paths for domain adaptation is intriguing and potentially powerful. \n* **Technical Soundness:** The authors demonstrate a clear understanding of deep learning and domain adaptation concepts. The proposed architecture is well-defined and technically sound.\n* **Experimental Evidence:** While the initial experimental setup was limited, the authors have addressed many of the reviewer's concerns in their response. They have included additional experiments exploring different computational capacities and flow configurations, and they have incorporated the state-of-the-art MCD method for comparison.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Limited Experimental Scope:** While the authors have addressed some of the initial shortcomings, the experimental evaluation still lacks a comprehensive comparison with a wider range of state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods. \n* **Ablation Studies:** More extensive ablation studies are needed to thoroughly understand the impact of different architectural choices (e.g., number of flows, flow configurations) on performance.\n* **Theoretical Justification:** The intuition behind the adaptive computation paths is not fully explored. A deeper theoretical analysis could strengthen the paper's contribution.\n\n**Overall:**\n\nThe paper presents a promising new approach to domain adaptation with potential for significant impact. However, the current experimental evaluation is not yet sufficient to warrant acceptance at a top-tier conference. \n\n**Final Decision: Reject** \n\n\n\nThe authors should address the remaining weaknesses through further experimentation and theoretical analysis. They should also consider expanding the scope of their comparison to include a wider range of state-of-the-art methods.  With these improvements, the paper could be a strong candidate for future submission."

While the core idea is promising, several aspects raise concerns about its suitability for publication in a top-tier conference:\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Novelty:** The paper explores a specific application of machine learning for predicting DNA folding patterns using ChIP-seq data, which is not extensively explored in the literature.\n* **Methodology:** The authors utilize a bidirectional LSTM RNN, a suitable architecture for capturing sequential information in DNA sequences.\n* **Evaluation:** The authors provide quantitative evaluation metrics and compare their model to other machine learning approaches.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Limited novelty:** The authors acknowledge the existence of related work but fail to adequately differentiate their approach. The paper lacks a clear explanation of what makes their method unique and how it improves upon existing techniques.\n* **Insufficient methodological details:** The paper lacks clarity regarding the data preprocessing, feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning procedures. This makes it difficult to fully understand and reproduce the results.\n* **Weak comparison with baselines:** The comparison with other models is limited and lacks a comprehensive set of baselines. The authors should include more established models and evaluate them using a broader range of metrics.\n* **Limited generalizability:** The authors acknowledge that their model is trained on a specific dataset and may not generalize to other organisms or datasets. This limitation should be discussed more thoroughly and potential solutions explored.\n* **Insufficient discussion:** The paper lacks a comprehensive discussion of the results, their biological implications, and potential limitations.\n\n**Reviewer Responses:**\n\nThe authors' responses to the reviewers' comments partially address some of the concerns. However, they fail to adequately address the issues of novelty, methodological clarity, and generalizability. The added information about the data and models is helpful but insufficient to overcome the existing weaknesses.\n\n## Final Decision: Reject\n\n\n"

      "response": "## Reasoning:\n\nThis paper attempts to generalize the concept of Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) to a broader framework called Generalized Probability Kernel (GPK). While the idea of unifying various discrepancy measures under a single framework is interesting, the current version of the paper suffers from several significant flaws that prevent it from being suitable for publication in a top-tier conference.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Novelty:** The concept of GPK, as a generalization of MMD and other discrepancy measures, has potential novelty.\n* **Theoretical Exploration:** The authors attempt to explore theoretical properties of GPK, including unbiased estimators and convergence bounds.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Lack of Clarity and Rigor:** The paper is poorly written and lacks mathematical rigor. Definitions are ambiguous, notations are inconsistent, and proofs are incomplete or missing. \n* **Insufficient Justification:** The motivation for the proposed framework is not clearly articulated. The authors mention word2vec as an example where discrete distributions with similarity measures exist, but this connection to GPK is not well-explained.\n* **Limited Empirical Validation:** The paper lacks any empirical evaluation to demonstrate the usefulness of GPK. Without experimental results, it is difficult to assess the practical significance of the proposed framework.\n* **Incomplete Proofs:** Several key proofs are missing or incomplete, making it impossible to fully evaluate the theoretical claims.\n* **Overly Broad Scope:** The authors attempt to cover too much ground in a single paper, leading to superficial treatment of various concepts.\n\n**Specific Issues:**\n\n* **Definition 2:** The definition of GPK is unclear and inconsistent with the use of \"K\" to represent both kernel functions and gram matrices.\n* **Theorem 5:** The proof is missing.\n* **Application to Two-Sample Test:** The application to two-sample testing is not well-defined, as the paper does not address how to estimate GPK when p and q are unknown.\n* **KSD Discussion:** The discussion on KSD is removed due to an incorrect proof, leaving a gap in the paper.\n\n**Author Response:**\n\nThe author response partially addresses some of the concerns raised by the reviewers. However, it does not fully resolve the issues regarding clarity, rigor, and empirical validation. The revised version still suffers from unclear definitions and incomplete proofs. The lack of empirical evidence remains a major weakness.\n\n\n## Final Decision: Reject\n\n\nBased on the significant flaws outlined above, the paper should be rejected for publication in a top-tier conference. The authors need to address the fundamental issues of clarity, rigor, and empirical validation before resubmission. \n"

      "response": "## Reasoning:\n\nThis paper presents an interesting idea for multi-task learning (MTL) by dynamically adjusting task weights during training using a novel method called $\\alpha$VIL. While the paper is well-written and easy to follow, several concerns raised by the reviewers need to be addressed before acceptance.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Novelty:** $\\alpha$VIL introduces a new approach to MTL by directly optimizing task weights based on task-specific model updates. This is a unique perspective compared to existing methods that rely on heuristics or extensive search.\n* **Clarity:** The paper is well-structured and clearly explains the proposed method, its motivation, and the experimental setup.\n* **Empirical Evaluation:** The authors provide empirical evidence on both computer vision (MultiMNIST) and natural language understanding (GLUE and SuperGLUE) tasks, demonstrating the potential of $\\alpha$VIL.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Limited Theoretical Justification:** The paper lacks a strong theoretical foundation for $\\alpha$VIL. While the intuition behind the method is presented, a more rigorous analysis of its properties and potential benefits would strengthen the paper significantly.\n* **Weak Empirical Results:** The experimental results, while showing some improvement over baselines, are not overwhelmingly convincing. The improvements are often marginal, and in some cases, $\\alpha$VIL performs worse than existing methods. The authors acknowledge this limitation and suggest further experiments and ablation studies, which are crucial for strengthening the paper's claims.\n* **Limited Baseline Comparison:** The choice of baselines could be expanded to include more diverse and recent MTL approaches. This would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of $\\alpha$VIL's performance.\n* **Lack of Robustness Analysis:** The authors should investigate the robustness of $\\alpha$VIL to different hyperparameter settings and dataset variations. This would demonstrate the generalizability and reliability of the proposed method.\n\n**Addressing Reviewer Concerns:**\n\nThe authors have addressed some of the reviewers' concerns in their response, particularly regarding the choice of MultiMNIST and the rationale behind the $\\alpha$ parameter. However, they acknowledge the need for further theoretical analysis, additional experiments, and ablation studies.\n\n\n## Final Decision: Reject\n\n\nWhile the paper presents an interesting idea and is well-written, the current state of the research is not sufficient for acceptance at a top-tier conference. The lack of strong theoretical justification, the limited and somewhat inconclusive empirical results, and the need for further exploration of the method's robustness and generalizability prevent it from meeting the high standards of such a venue. \n\nThe authors are encouraged to address the reviewers' concerns and resubmit their work to a more appropriate venue after conducting further research and strengthening the paper's theoretical and empirical foundations."

The authors argue that this is more cognitively plausible and potentially more effective. They provide experimental evidence on several referring expression segmentation datasets, showing improvements over existing models.\n\nHowever, several concerns remain:\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Novelty:** The idea of modulating both top-down and bottom-up visual processing with language is novel and potentially impactful.\n* **Empirical Results:** The paper demonstrates improvements over existing models on several benchmark datasets.\n* **Ablation Studies:** The ablation studies provide some evidence for the importance of both top-down and bottom-up language modulation.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Conceptual Motivation:** The paper lacks a strong conceptual motivation for why language should be integrated throughout the visual pathway. The connection to cognitive science is weakly established.\n* **Significance of Results:** While the paper shows improvements, they are not overwhelmingly significant. The variability across datasets and the lack of statistical significance tests raise questions about the robustness of the findings.\n* **Model Analysis:** The paper does not provide a deep analysis of how the language representations actually influence the low-level visual features. This makes it difficult to understand the true contribution of the proposed approach.\n* **Comparison to Related Work:** The connection to Step-ConvRNN is not clearly explained, and the paper does not adequately address the related work on language-guided visual attention.\n* **Clarity and Organization:** The paper could benefit from improved clarity and organization, particularly in the introduction and discussion sections.\n\n**Author Response:**\n\nThe authors' response partially addresses some of the concerns, but it does not fully convince me. The explanation for splitting the textual representation is still vague, and the proposed analyses for understanding the interaction between language and visual input are not yet complete. The authors also do not adequately address the concerns about the significance of the results and the lack of a strong conceptual motivation.\n\n## Final Decision: Reject\n\n\n"

The authors propose a model, CC-DNI, which incorporates cerebellar architecture and function into a deep learning framework. \n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Novelty:** The paper proposes a fresh perspective on the cerebellum's role in learning, connecting it to the concept of decoupled neural interfaces.\n* **Clear writing:** The paper is well-written and easy to follow, making the complex concepts accessible.\n* **Experimental validation:** The authors provide experimental evidence supporting their claims using various tasks, demonstrating the potential benefits of the proposed model.\n* **Addressing reviewer comments:** The authors have thoughtfully addressed the reviewers' concerns, incorporating new figures and predictions, clarifying the model's connection to existing literature, and improving the clarity of the manuscript.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Limited novelty:** While the connection between cerebellum and DNI is novel, the core idea of DNI itself is not groundbreaking. The paper primarily builds upon existing work, and the novelty lies in the application to the cerebellum.\n* **Lack of strong empirical validation:** While the authors provide some experimental evidence, the paper lacks strong empirical validation. The experiments are primarily focused on demonstrating the model's ability to learn tasks, but lack direct comparisons to other models and limited exploration of the model's predictions.\n* **Overly optimistic claims:** The authors' claims about the model's significance and potential impact might be overstated. While the model is interesting, its implications for understanding the cerebellum are still preliminary and require further investigation.\n\n**Overall:**\n\nThe paper presents a novel and interesting idea, but its novelty is limited by its reliance on existing DNI concepts. While the authors have addressed the reviewers' concerns, the paper still lacks strong empirical validation and its claims regarding its impact on cerebellar neuroscience are premature.\n\n## Final Decision: **Reject** \n\n\n"

While the idea of using a geometric approach to graph generation is interesting and the paper is well-written, several significant concerns raised by the reviewers warrant a rejection.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Novel Idea:** The geometric interpretation of graph generation is a fresh perspective and has the potential to be impactful.\n* **Theoretical Foundation:** The paper provides some theoretical support for its claims, including theorems about isomorphism consistency and node sampling.\n* **Clear Writing:** The paper is well-organized and easy to follow.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Limited Empirical Evidence:** The experiments are unconvincing due to the use of small datasets (maximum 20 nodes) and a lack of comparison with strong baselines like NetGAN. The authors' claim of significant speed improvements over autoregressive models also lacks strong evidence.\n* **Overstated Contributions:** The paper claims novelty in several areas (isomorphism consistency, expressiveness, scalability), but these claims are not well-supported by a thorough literature review. The connection between the proposed method and existing work is not clearly established.\n* **Unclear Implementation Details:** Several aspects of the implementation are unclear, such as the role of the $\\phi$ function, the learning process for these parameters, and the handling of node collisions.\n* **Weak Theoretical Analysis:** While the paper includes theorems, their connection to the practical performance of GG-GAN is not well-established.\n* **Missing Ethical Considerations:** The brief mention of ethical considerations feels superficial and lacks depth.\n\n**Reviewer Feedback:**\n\nThe reviewers raise valid and critical points about the paper's novelty, experimental design, theoretical analysis, and implementation details. The authors' lack of response to these concerns further weakens the paper's position.\n\n\n## Final Decision: Reject \n\n\nThe paper, while presenting an interesting idea, suffers from significant weaknesses in its empirical support, theoretical analysis, and clarity of implementation.

While the paper is well-written and the proposed method is conceptually interesting, several concerns raised by the reviewers warrant careful consideration.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Novelty:** $\\alpha$VIL introduces a unique approach to task weight estimation by directly utilizing task-specific model updates during meta-optimization. This distinguishes it from existing methods that rely on heuristics or extensive search.\n* **Clarity:** The paper is well-structured and clearly explains the proposed method, making it easy to follow.\n* **Empirical Evaluation:** The authors provide empirical results on both computer vision (MultiMNIST) and natural language understanding (GLUE and SuperGLUE) tasks, demonstrating the potential of $\\alpha$VIL.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Limited Theoretical Justification:** The paper lacks a strong theoretical foundation for the proposed method. The reviewers rightly point out the need for a more rigorous analysis to understand the rationale behind $\\alpha$VIL's effectiveness.\n* **Weak Empirical Performance:** While $\\alpha$VIL shows some promise, the empirical results are not overwhelmingly convincing. The improvements over baselines are often marginal, and in some cases, $\\alpha$VIL even performs worse. This raises questions about the practical significance of the proposed method.\n* **Limited Experimental Scope:** The experiments primarily focus on a single auxiliary task in MultiMNIST and a subset of GLUE tasks. Exploring more complex multi-task settings with multiple auxiliary tasks would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of $\\alpha$VIL's capabilities.\n* **Lack of Ablation Studies:** The authors could benefit from conducting ablation studies to understand the contribution of different components of $\\alpha$VIL. This would help identify the key factors driving its performance and provide insights for future improvements.\n\n**Addressing Reviewer Concerns:**\n\nThe authors' response to the reviewers' comments acknowledges many of the weaknesses and proposes improvements for the camera-ready version. Specifically, they plan to:\n\n* Provide a more thorough theoretical analysis of $\\alpha$VIL.\n* Add more experiments and ablation studies to strengthen the empirical evidence.\n* Include standard deviations for NLU tasks in the camera-ready version.\n* Clarify the rationale behind the choice of MultiMNIST and provide additional sanity checks.\n\n**Final Decision: Reject**\n\nWhile the paper presents an interesting idea and demonstrates potential, the current version falls short of the standards required for acceptance at a top-tier conference. The lack of theoretical justification, weak empirical performance, limited experimental scope, and absence of ablation studies significantly hinder the paper's overall impact. \n\nThe authors' willingness to address these concerns is commendable, and with substantial revisions, the paper could potentially be resubmitted to a more appropriate venue. However, in its current form, it is not ready for publication at a top-tier conference.\n\n\n\n"

This hardware-aware approach is a significant strength, differentiating it from many quantization papers that focus solely on software simulations.\n* **Hardware Evaluation:** The authors provide a thorough hardware evaluation using RTL synthesis, showcasing the potential area and power savings of BM compared to FP8. The methodology is more rigorous than many similar papers, adding to the paper's credibility.\n* **Extensive Exploration:** The paper explores a wide range<bos><h1>\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Lack of Novelty in Core Concept:** The shared exponent bias concept isn't entirely new. While the application to minifloats is novel, the core idea has been explored before in the context of FP8.\n* **Clarity Issues:** The paper suffers from some clarity issues, particularly in explaining the rationale behind the choice of 4-bit exponents and the Kulisch accumulator. The revised draft addresses some of these issues, but further improvements are needed.\n* **Limited Scope:** The paper focuses primarily on smaller networks (ResNet-18) and could benefit from experiments on larger models like ResNet50 to demonstrate scalability.\n* **Overhead of Multiple Formats:** The paper's claim of minimal overhead for denormal support and the use of multiple formats in training needs further clarification and more detailed analysis.\n\n## Final Decision: Accept with Revisions\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nDespite some weaknesses, the paper presents a novel hardware implementation of a minifloat representation with promising results. The hardware evaluation and extensive exploration of the design space are strong points. However, the paper needs revisions to improve clarity and address the concerns regarding the overhead of multiple formats and the rationale behind the 4-bit exponent limit. \n\n\nFinal Decision: Accept with Revisions \n"

      "response": "## Reasoning:\n\nThis paper presents an interesting approach to improving robustness and uncertainty estimation in neural networks by training multiple independent subnetworks within a single model architecture. The core idea of using a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) configuration to achieve this is novel and shows promising results. \n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Novelty:** The MIMO approach offers a unique way to leverage multiple predictions within a single forward pass, potentially leading to significant computational savings compared to traditional ensemble methods.\n* **Empirical Results:** The paper presents strong empirical evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of MIMO on various benchmark datasets, achieving significant improvements in accuracy, calibration error, and robustness compared to single-model baselines and some existing ensemble methods.\n* **Clarity and Structure:** The paper is well-written and clearly explains the proposed method, experimental setup, and results. The figures and tables are well-designed and effectively communicate the key findings.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Originality Concerns:** While the MIMO approach is novel, the authors acknowledge the existence of related multi-branch architectures. A more thorough discussion and comparison with these related works, particularly those mentioned by Reviewer 4, would strengthen the paper's originality claim.\n* **Theoretical Justification:** The paper lacks a strong theoretical foundation for explaining the emergence of independence between subnetworks. While empirical evidence is provided, a deeper theoretical understanding of this phenomenon would significantly enhance the paper's impact.\n* **Computational Cost Analysis:** While the authors address the computational cost concerns raised by the reviewers, the analysis remains somewhat incomplete. A more detailed comparison of FLOPs and other relevant metrics across different methods would provide a clearer picture of MIMO's computational efficiency.\n* **Limited Dataset Scope:** The paper focuses primarily on standard image classification benchmarks. Exploring MIMO's performance on a wider range of datasets and tasks would strengthen the generalizability of the findings.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nDespite the weaknesses, the paper presents a promising and innovative approach to improving robustness and uncertainty estimation in neural networks. The empirical results are compelling, and the potential for computational efficiency is significant. However, addressing the concerns regarding originality, theoretical justification, and computational cost analysis would significantly strengthen the paper's overall quality and impact.\n\n\n**Final Decision: Accept with Revisions** \n"

The proposed method, CanvasEmb, shows promising results on two downstream tasks: element role labeling and image captioning. \n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Novel Dataset:** The creation of a large-scale dataset of parsed PowerPoint slides is a significant contribution. This dataset addresses the scarcity of labeled layout data, a major challenge in this field.\n* **Pre-training Approach:** Leveraging pre-training with a Transformer architecture offers a potentially powerful approach to learning general layout representations.\n* **Clear Writing:** The paper is well-written and easy to understand.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Limited Evaluation:** The evaluation is limited to two relatively simple tasks and lacks comparison with strong baselines, especially those specifically designed for layout understanding. The authors acknowledge this weakness and plan to address it in future revisions.\n* **Lack of Justification for Transformer:** The paper does not clearly articulate why a Transformer architecture is superior to other potential approaches, such as Graph Neural Networks, for representing layout information.\n* **Missing Details:** The paper lacks details about the Transformer model architecture and training procedure. \n* **Dataset Details:**  Information about the dataset, such as the number of elements per slide, annotation process, and potential biases, is insufficient.\n\n**Reviewer Feedback:**\n\nThe reviewers raise valid concerns about the paper's evaluation, lack of comparison with existing work, and missing details.

      "response": "##  Analysis of the Paper \"Global Node Attentions via Adaptive Spectral Filters\"\n\nThis paper proposes a novel GNN architecture called GNAN that aims to address the limitations of existing GNNs in handling disassortative graphs.  \n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Addresses a relevant problem:** The paper tackles the important issue of GNNs' struggle with disassortative graphs, a real-world challenge with significant implications for various applications.\n* **Novel approach:** The use of learnable spectral filters via multi-head attention is a novel contribution, potentially offering a more flexible and adaptive approach compared to traditional GNNs relying on fixed filters.\n* **Empirical evaluation:** The paper provides a thorough empirical evaluation on multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method on both assortative and disassortative graphs.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Novelty concerns:** While the paper introduces a novel architecture, some reviewers argue that the core idea of using attention for capturing distant node relationships is not entirely novel. The authors need to more clearly articulate the unique contributions of their approach compared to existing methods like Non-Local GNNs.\n* **Complexity concerns:**  There are concerns regarding the computational complexity of the proposed method, particularly regarding the global attention mechanism. While the authors claim $O(m\\times |E|)$ complexity, reviewers are skeptical due to the nature of the attention mechanism.  The authors need to provide more convincing arguments and potentially revise their complexity analysis.\n* **Limited experimental scope:** The paper focuses primarily on node classification. Expanding the evaluation to other tasks like graph reconstruction and link prediction would strengthen the paper's impact and demonstrate the broader applicability of the proposed method.\n* **Dataset limitations:** The paper uses a limited set of disassortative datasets, with some being relatively small in size.  Expanding the dataset scope to include larger disassortative graphs, including synthetically generated ones with controllable $\\beta$ values, would significantly strengthen the paper's claims.\n\n**Author Response:**\n\nThe authors have addressed some of the concerns raised by the reviewers. They have provided additional details on the complexity analysis, added experimental results for the Chameleon dataset, and acknowledged the need for further experiments on other tasks and larger datasets. However, the concerns regarding the novelty and complexity remain partially unresolved.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nFinal Decision: **Reject**\n\nWhile the paper presents an interesting idea and shows promising results, the concerns regarding novelty and complexity need to be addressed more convincingly. The authors need to provide a more thorough analysis of the computational complexity and clearly articulate the unique contributions of their work compared to existing methods. Expanding the experimental scope to include other tasks and larger datasets would also significantly strengthen the paper's impact. \n\n\n"

However, the paper suffers from several critical flaws that prevent its acceptance in its current form. \n\n**Major Issues:\n\n* **Overly dense and unclear writing: The paper is extremely dense and difficult to follow. The authors acknowledge this issue but the proposed solutions are insufficient. A clear and concise explanation of the algorithm and its workings is crucial for understanding the paper's contributions.\n* **Lack of clarity and examples: The paper lacks concrete examples and applications. While the authors mention the potential for future work, the lack of any examples hinders the evaluation of the algorithm's practical applicability.\n* **Insufficient empirical validation: The absence of empirical results weakens the paper's impact. While theoretical contributions are acknowledged, the lack of empirical validation makes it difficult to assess the algorithm's effectiveness.\n* **Weak argumentation: The paper's argumentation is weak.

While the idea of using regularized inversion for target computation is interesting, the paper suffers from several weaknesses that prevent it from being a strong candidate for publication in a top-tier conference:\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Conceptual Clarity:** The paper clearly explains the proposed method and its connection to existing target propagation techniques.\n* **Practical Implementation:** The authors demonstrate that their method can be easily implemented within a standard differentiable programming framework.\n* **Potential for Improvement:** The experimental results, while limited, suggest that the proposed method can achieve competitive performance on certain tasks.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Limited Theoretical Justification:** The theoretical analysis is superficial and does not provide strong guarantees for the superiority of the proposed method over backpropagation. The connection to Gauss-Newton methods is intriguing but underdeveloped.\n* **Weak Empirical Evidence:** The experimental results are limited in scope and lack robustness. The authors need to conduct more extensive experiments on a wider range of tasks and datasets to demonstrate the generalizability and effectiveness of their method.\n* **Lack of Comparison:** The paper does not adequately compare its method to other existing optimization techniques for RNNs, such as those mentioned by Reviewer 4. This makes it difficult to assess the novelty and significance of the contributions.\n* **Unclear Scope:** The paper claims that the method can be applied to all neural networks, but the experiments focus solely on RNNs. This raises questions about the general applicability of the proposed approach.\n\n**Reviewer Feedback:**\n\nThe reviewers raise valid concerns about the theoretical and empirical limitations of the paper. Reviewer 1 and 4 highlight the lack of strong theoretical guarantees and the need for more comprehensive empirical evaluation. Reviewer 3 emphasizes the need for stronger experimental results on realistic datasets and comparisons with other relevant methods.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWhile the paper presents an interesting idea, its current form is not strong enough for publication in a top-tier conference. The lack of robust theoretical analysis, limited empirical evidence, and insufficient comparison with existing methods prevent the paper from making a significant contribution to the field.\n\n\nFinal Decision: Reject \n"

      "response": "## Reasoning:\n\nThis paper presents a significant theoretical contribution to our understanding of the optimization landscape of two-layer ReLU neural networks. \n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Novelty:** The paper builds upon previous work on convex formulations of neural network training but offers a novel approach that doesn't rely on duality. This leads to a deeper characterization of the global optima and provides new insights into the relationship between the non-convex training problem and its convex counterpart.\n* **Rigorous Analysis:** The authors provide a rigorous mathematical analysis, clearly defining key concepts like \"nearly minimal\" and \"minimal\" neural networks and demonstrating their connection to the convex optimization problem. \n* **Practical Implications:** The paper offers practical tools, such as a polynomial-time algorithm for checking the global optimality of a neural network and a path connecting any point on the loss landscape to the global minimum. These tools can be valuable for understanding and potentially improving training algorithms.\n* **Strong Reviews:** The reviews are overwhelmingly positive, with reviewers praising the technical novelty, significance, and clarity of the work. While some reviewers point out limitations (e.g., the focus on two-layer networks and ReLU activation), they acknowledge the paper's substantial contributions and potential for future extensions.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Limited Scope:** The paper's focus on two-layer ReLU networks and weight decay limits its immediate applicability to broader deep learning scenarios. \n* **Lack of Empirical Validation:** The paper lacks empirical validation to demonstrate the practical usefulness of the proposed tools and insights. While theoretical analysis is crucial, empirical evidence would strengthen the paper's impact.\n\n**Overall:**\n\nDespite its limitations, the paper presents a significant theoretical advance in our understanding of the optimization landscape of neural networks. The rigorous analysis, novel insights, and practical tools make it a valuable contribution to the field. The authors have addressed the reviewers' concerns constructively, further strengthening the paper.\n\n\n## Final Decision: Accept \n"

While the concept is interesting and potentially impactful, the paper suffers from several critical weaknesses that prevent it from being accepted in its current form. \n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Novel Benchmark:** The proposed meta-referential games offer a unique framework for evaluating compositional learning in AI agents. \n* **Symbolic-Continuous Representation:** The SCS representation attempts to bridge the gap between symbolic and continuous representations, which is a relevant and important area of research.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Clarity and Communication:** The paper is difficult to follow. The abstract and introduction are dense and lack clarity. The authors need to clearly define key terms like \"positional disentanglement metric\" and \"systematic generalization\" and provide more concrete examples to make the paper more accessible.\n* **Insufficient Experimental Evidence:** The experimental results are not strong enough to support the claims. The performance is barely above chance in some cases, and the authors do not provide sufficient details about the experimental setup, model architectures, and training regimes. \n* **Lack of Comparison:** The paper does not adequately compare its proposed SCS representation with other existing representations, particularly continuous representations, which are widely used in compositional learning. \n* **Limited Scope:** The paper focuses solely on a specific type of game, limiting the generalizability of the findings. \n* **Insufficient Discussion:** The paper lacks a thorough discussion of the implications of the results and potential future directions.\n\n**Reviewer Feedback:**\n\nThe reviewers' comments highlight the same key weaknesses.

The authors introduce a novel approach to neural network compression by leveraging the Hausdorff distance of tropical zonotopes. While the theoretical contributions are novel and potentially significant, the empirical results are limited in scope and the experimental evaluation is not as strong as it could be.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Novel Theoretical Contribution:** The paper introduces a new theoretical framework for neural network approximation using tropical geometry, which is a novel approach. The connection between Hausdorff distance and neural network approximation is intriguing and potentially impactful for future research.\n* **Clear Writing:** The paper is well-written and accessible to a broad audience. The authors clearly explain the background on tropical geometry and its application to neural networks.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Limited Empirical Evidence:** The empirical evaluation is limited to small-scale datasets (MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100). The authors acknowledge this limitation but it significantly weakens the impact of the paper.\n* **Lack of Comparison with State-of-the-art methods:** The authors compare their method with ThiNet and some baseline methods but do not provide a comprehensive comparison with the current state-of-the-art methods.

      "response": "## Reasoning:\n\nThis paper presents PEARL, a novel framework for differentially private data synthesis using deep generative models. While the core idea is interesting and the paper demonstrates promising results, several aspects require further improvement before acceptance at a top-tier conference.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Novelty:** PEARL introduces a unique approach to private data synthesis by leveraging characteristic functions and adversarial re-weighting. This differentiates it from existing methods like DP-GAN and DP-MERF.\n* **Theoretical Guarantees:** The paper provides theoretical guarantees of performance, which is crucial for establishing the robustness and reliability of the proposed method.\n* **Empirical Evaluation:** The paper conducts experiments on multiple datasets and demonstrates that PEARL outperforms existing baselines in several scenarios.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Limited Benchmarking:** The empirical evaluation is limited in scope. While the authors have added DPCGAN and the Credit dataset during rebuttal, a more comprehensive benchmarking against a wider range of baselines (including PATE-GAN, PrivBayes, CTGAN) and datasets (including CIFAR-10) is necessary to solidify the claims of superiority.\n* **Lack of Complexity Analysis:** The paper lacks a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm. While the authors provide a high-level description, a formal analysis would strengthen the paper's contribution.\n* **Clarity and Completeness:** Some aspects of the implementation details, particularly the privacy-preserving optimization procedure, require further clarification. The authors address some of these concerns in the rebuttal, but more detailed explanations are needed.\n* **Limited Discussion of Related Work:** The paper could benefit from a more thorough discussion of related work, particularly regarding graphical model-based approaches for private data synthesis.\n\n**Author Response:**\n\nThe authors have addressed some of the concerns raised by the reviewers, particularly by adding new baselines and datasets. However, the lack of a comprehensive complexity analysis and the need for further clarification on certain implementation details remain significant concerns.\n\n\n## Final Decision: Reject\n\n\nWhile PEARL presents a promising approach to private data synthesis, the current version requires substantial revisions to meet the standards of a top-tier conference.

      "response": "## Reasoning:\n\nThis paper proposes MCTransformer, a framework combining Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with Transformers for offline reinforcement learning. While the core idea of integrating these two powerful techniques is intriguing, the paper suffers from several critical weaknesses that prevent its acceptance at a top-tier conference:\n\n**1. Limited Novelty and Originality:**\n\n*  Reviewers consistently point out the lack of novelty. The paper essentially combines existing components (MCTS and Transformers) without demonstrating a significant advancement beyond prior work like AlphaGo/AlphaZero. \n*  The authors fail to convincingly argue why this specific combination is novel or superior to existing approaches.\n\n**2. Weak Empirical Evaluation:**\n\n*  The evaluation is limited to a single, non-standard domain (SameGame) and lacks comparisons to relevant baselines. \n*  The authors do not compare against other MCTS-based methods with neural networks (AlphaGo, AlphaZero, MuZero), which are directly relevant to their work.\n*  The comparison with random play and Transformer-only solutions is insufficient to demonstrate the effectiveness of MCTransformer.\n\n**3. Unclear Methodology and Presentation:**\n\n*  The paper lacks clarity in explaining the proposed method, particularly the role of the Transformer in the MCTS framework. \n*  Figure 1 is poorly designed and requires significant improvement for clarity.\n*  The authors do not adequately address reviewer comments regarding the MCTS baseline and the rollout policy.\n\n**4. Missing Author Response:**\n\n*  The absence of an author response further hinders the evaluation process. Addressing reviewer concerns and clarifying ambiguities would have strengthened the paper.\n\n**5. Limited Scope and Impact:**\n\n*  The focus on a single game domain limits the generalizability and impact of the findings. \n*  The paper does not explore the potential of MCTransformer in other reinforcement learning settings or address broader implications for offline RL.\n\n\n\n## Final Decision: Reject \n"

While the idea of distinguishing between positive, negative, and irrelevant tokens is intuitive and addresses a real problem, the novelty and significance of the proposed method are questionable. \n\nHere's a breakdown:\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Clear and well-written:** The paper is easy to understand and follow.\n* **Addresses a relevant problem:** Text degeneration is a known issue in language models, and the paper proposes a method to mitigate it.\n* **Empirical evaluation:** The paper includes both automatic and human evaluations to support its claims.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Limited novelty:**  Reviewers rightly point out that the core idea of penalizing repetitive tokens is similar to existing unlikelihood training methods. The authors' claim that unlikelihood training only considers negative tokens is factually incorrect, as evidenced by the cited paper.\n* **Insufficient experimental evidence:** The experiments are limited to a small GPT-2 model and a single task (wikitext-103).  The authors do not explore larger models or other tasks where repetition is a significant concern (e.g., summarization, machine translation).\n* **Questionable metric choices:** The reliance on perplexity as the primary metric for quality is criticized by reviewers, as it can be misleading in the context of text generation.\n* **Lack of comparison to strong baselines:** The paper does not compare its method to more recent sampling techniques like typical sampling, which have shown promising results in reducing repetition.\n* **Missing author response:** The absence of an author response to the reviewers' concerns further weakens the paper's case.\n\n**Overall:**\n\nWhile the paper presents an interesting idea, its novelty and significance are limited. The lack of strong experimental evidence, questionable metric choices, and missing author response raise serious concerns about its suitability for publication in a top-tier conference like ICLR.\n\n\n## Final Decision: Reject \n"

      "response": "## Reasoning:\n\nThis paper proposes an interesting idea for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection using graph representations of images. While the concept is novel and potentially promising, the paper suffers from several critical weaknesses that prevent it from meeting the standards of a top-tier conference:\n\n**1. Lack of Rigorous Evaluation:**\n\n* **Missing Comparisons:** The paper fails to compare its proposed method to established state-of-the-art OOD detection techniques.  Simply stating that the performance is comparable is insufficient without concrete comparisons.\n* **Limited Dataset:** The reliance on a single dataset (LSUN) limits the generalizability of the results. \n* **Insufficient Ablation Studies:** The paper lacks ablation studies to understand the impact of different components (e.g., graph embedding algorithms, hyperparameters) on performance.\n\n**2. Weaknesses in Methodology and Presentation:**\n\n* **Unclear Novelty:** The paper struggles to clearly articulate the novelty of its approach. While combining graph structures with OOD detection is interesting, the paper doesn't convincingly demonstrate how it significantly advances the field beyond existing methods.\n* **Over-reliance on Pre-trained Detectors:** The success of the method heavily depends on the quality of the pre-trained object detection network. The paper acknowledges this dependency but doesn't adequately address the potential limitations when the pre-trained detector lacks knowledge about the OOD data's semantic concepts.\n* **Poor Writing and Clarity:** The paper suffers from grammatical errors, unclear explanations, and missing details, making it difficult to follow the proposed method and understand the results.\n\n**3. Insufficient Discussion of Related Work:**\n\n* The paper's discussion of related work is incomplete, neglecting to mention important OOD detection methods based on distance scores and logit scores.\n\n\n## Final Decision: Reject \n\n\nThe paper presents an intriguing idea but requires significant revisions to address the aforementioned weaknesses before it can be considered for publication in a top-tier conference.  The lack of rigorous evaluation, unclear novelty, and methodological limitations prevent it from meeting the required standards. \n"

While the idea is interesting and the experimental results show promising improvements in robustness, several concerns raised by the reviewers warrant careful consideration before acceptance.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Novelty:** The concept of collaboratively training two models with different adversarial training strategies is novel and potentially impactful.\n* **Empirical Results:** The paper demonstrates significant improvements in robustness on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets compared to existing baselines.\n* **Clear Writing:** The paper is well-written and easy to understand.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Lack of Theoretical Justification:** The reviewers rightly point out the lack of a theoretical analysis explaining why CAT works. The authors need to provide a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms behind the observed improvements.\n* **Limited Comparison with Existing Work:** The paper does not adequately compare CAT with existing ensemble methods for adversarial training, such as those cited by Reviewer 1. A more comprehensive comparison is crucial to establish the novelty and significance of the proposed approach.\n* **Computational Cost:** Doubling the training process significantly increases computational cost and resource requirements. The authors need to address this concern and explore potential optimizations.\n* **Limited Dataset and Architecture Scope:** The experiments are conducted on relatively small datasets (CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100) and a limited set of network architectures. Evaluating CAT on larger datasets and a wider range of architectures is essential to demonstrate its broader applicability.\n* **Missing Ablation Studies:** The authors need to conduct more ablation studies to understand the impact of different components of CAT and to compare it with alternative approaches, as suggested by Reviewer 4.\n\n**Author Response:**\n\nThe absence of an author response further hinders the evaluation process. Addressing the reviewers' concerns and providing clarifications would significantly strengthen the paper.\n\n\n## Final Decision: Reject\n\n\nWhile the paper presents an interesting idea with promising results, the lack of theoretical justification, limited comparison with existing work, and unanswered questions regarding computational cost and broader applicability prevent its acceptance at this time.  The authors are encouraged to revise the paper by addressing the reviewers' concerns and conducting further experiments to strengthen their claims. \n"

The Proximal Validation Protocol (PVP) aims to construct a validation set from augmented training data, potentially allowing for more efficient use of the training data while maintaining reliable model evaluation. \n\nHowever, despite the intriguing concept, the paper suffers from several critical weaknesses that prevent its acceptance at a top-tier conference:\n\n**1. Lack of Theoretical Justification:**  Reviewers consistently highlight the absence of a theoretical foundation for PVP. While the authors mention limitations regarding theoretical analysis, the lack of any theoretical support for why the proposed method works undermines the significance of the empirical findings. \n\n**2. Weak Empirical Evaluation:**\n\n* **Dataset Size:**  Reviewers point out the use of small datasets, which raises concerns about the generalizability of the results. \n* **Limited Scope:** The focus on classification tasks and the lack of exploration in other settings (regression, unsupervised learning) limits the scope and impact of the findings.\n* **Insufficient Ablation Studies:**  The paper lacks thorough ablation studies to understand the impact of key hyperparameters (e.g., size of the proximal validation set, data augmentation choices). This makes it difficult to assess the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed method.\n* **Missing Statistical Significance:** The absence of statistical significance tests in key tables weakens the confidence in the reported results.\n\n**3. Unclear Connection to Real-World Applications:** While the authors emphasize the motivation stemming from \"technical debt\" in ML production, the paper lacks concrete evidence demonstrating PVP's effectiveness in real-world scenarios. The absence of experiments on industrial datasets or noisy label scenarios further weakens this claim.\n\n**4. Questionable Metric Choice:** The reliance on the \"T-V gap\" metric, which can be manipulated by artificially introducing bias, raises concerns about the validity of the evaluation.\n\n\n**Final Decision: Reject** \n\n\nThe paper presents an interesting idea but falls short of the standards required for acceptance at a top-tier conference due to the significant weaknesses outlined above. Addressing these issues through theoretical analysis, a more robust empirical evaluation, and a clearer connection to real-world applications would be necessary for future consideration."

      "response": "## Detailed Reasoning:\n\nThis paper proposes using pretrained protein structure embeddings from OmegaFold for protein-protein interaction (PPI) prediction. While the idea of leveraging structural information is promising, the paper falls short in several key areas:\n\n**Limited Novelty and Contribution:**\n\n* **Reliance on Existing Methods:** The core contribution seems to be using pretrained OmegaFold embeddings as input to standard graph neural networks (GNNs) for PPI prediction. This approach lacks significant novelty, as it primarily combines existing techniques without proposing novel architectures or training paradigms.\n* **Weak Empirical Evidence:** The reported improvements over existing baselines are marginal and lack confidence intervals. The authors only compare against GraphSAGE and GAT, neglecting to mention other state-of-the-art methods like dMaSIF. \n* **Unclear Advantage of Structural Embeddings:** The paper doesn't convincingly demonstrate the superiority of using structural embeddings over other protein representations, such as sequence-based embeddings from OmegaPLM.\n\n**Methodological Concerns:**\n\n* **Baseline Issues:** The chosen baselines are weak and not representative of the current state-of-the-art in PPI prediction. Comparing against a simple ResNet trained on protein sequences is not a fair evaluation.\n* **Lack of Ablation Studies:** The paper lacks thorough ablation studies to understand the individual contributions of structural embeddings and the GNN architecture. This makes it difficult to assess the true impact of the proposed method.\n* **Negative Sampling:** The paper mentions negative sampling during training but doesn't provide details about its implementation. This lack of transparency hinders reproducibility and understanding of the training process.\n\n**Clarity and Presentation:**\n\n* **Confusing Structure:** The paper's structure is somewhat unclear, with excessive focus on OmegaFold and insufficient explanation of the proposed model's design and rationale.\n* **Lack of Visualizations:** The paper could benefit from more visualizations to illustrate the data, model architecture, and results.\n\n\n**Overall:**\n\nThe paper presents a potentially interesting idea but fails to execute it effectively. The lack of novelty, weak empirical evidence, methodological concerns, and clarity issues make it unsuitable for publication in a top-tier conference like ICLR.\n\n\n**Final Decision: Reject**"

      "response": "## Analysis\n\nThis paper proposes \"Scrunch,\" a privacy-preserving representation learning method for MLaaS. While the goal of protecting sensitive information during data exchange is crucial, the paper suffers from several critical weaknesses that prevent its acceptance at a top-tier conference like ICLR.\n\n**Here's a breakdown of the issues:**\n\n* **Fundamental Flaw in the Privacy Guarantee:** Reviewer 2 correctly identifies a major flaw in the proposed approach. The server, even with the center loss, can reconstruct the client's encoder and effectively gain access to the entire model. This undermines the core claim of privacy preservation during both training and inference. The authors' response to this criticism is missing, further highlighting the lack of awareness regarding this fundamental issue.\n* **Weak Threat Model:** The paper's threat model is overly simplistic. Assuming a \"curious\" server while simultaneously allowing it to manipulate the center loss parameter is unrealistic and weakens the proposed solution's credibility. \n* **Limited Empirical Evaluation:** The experiments are limited to two shallow models and two datasets. The lack of comparison with established privacy-preserving techniques like fully homomorphic encryption and the absence of a more challenging privacy-preserving task evaluation further weaken the paper's empirical contribution.\n* **Ambiguous Claims and Lack of Clarity:** Several statements in the paper are ambiguous and require clarification. For example, the description of the center loss and its role in privacy preservation is unclear. Additionally, the lack of details about the private task for MNIST raises concerns about the completeness of the experimental setup.\n* **Insufficient Discussion of Limitations:** The paper fails to adequately address the limitations of its approach, particularly regarding the potential for information leakage through intermediate features. The authors dismiss the concern about time-series data leakage without providing a convincing counter-argument.\n\n**Overall, the paper presents an interesting idea but suffers from fundamental flaws in its design, a weak threat model, limited empirical evaluation, and a lack of clarity. The missing author response further indicates a lack of engagement with the reviewers' concerns.**\n\n\nFinal Decision: Reject \n"

While the authors acknowledge this limitation and suggest future directions, the current scope restricts the impact of the work.\n* **Incremental Progress:** While the paper makes a valuable contribution, some reviewers argue that the results are incremental compared to existing work like PP16. The authors need to more clearly articulate the novel aspects of their approach and how it builds upon previous research.\n* **Lack of Formal Proofs:** Some key claims, particularly regarding the monotonicity of regions of attraction, are based on empirical evidence rather than rigorous mathematical proofs. This weakens the overall strength of the argument.\n\n**Reviewer Feedback:**\n\nThe reviewer feedback highlights the need for a clearer articulation of the paper's contributions and a stronger emphasis on the novelty of the results. The authors have addressed some of the concerns in their response, but further clarification is needed regarding the specific differences between their work and PP16.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nBased on the above analysis, I recommend **Accepting** the paper with the following conditions:\n\n* The authors should provide a more detailed and explicit comparison with PP16, highlighting the specific contributions and novelties of their work.\n* The authors should strengthen the theoretical analysis by providing formal proofs for key claims, particularly those related to the monotonicity of regions of attraction.\n* The authors should acknowledge the limitations of their work and discuss potential avenues for future research, particularly extending the results to more general game settings.\n\n\n\nFinal Decision: Accept"

While the concept of period drift is interesting and potentially significant, the paper's contributions fall short of warranting acceptance at a top-tier conference. \n\nHere's a breakdown of the reasons:\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Lack of Theoretical Justification:** The paper struggles to clearly define and differentiate \"period drift\" from existing client drift issues.  Reviewers rightly point out the need for stronger theoretical grounding to support the claim that period drift is a distinct and significant problem requiring a specialized solution.\n* **Limited Novelty:** The core idea of learning a parameterized aggregator is not entirely novel.  Reviewers draw comparisons to existing knowledge distillation techniques like FedET and DS-FL, highlighting the need for a more thorough comparison and justification for FedPA's unique contributions.\n* **Reliance on Proxy Data:** The use of a proxy dataset for training the aggregator introduces a significant limitation. This approach assumes access to a representative dataset on the server, which may not always be feasible or ethical in real-world FL scenarios.  Reviewers rightly question the practicality and generalizability of this approach.\n* **Weak Empirical Evaluation:** The experimental results are limited in scope and lack strong baselines. The datasets used are relatively simple, and the performance gains over existing methods are not convincingly demonstrated.  Reviewers suggest expanding the evaluation to include more challenging datasets and a wider range of baselines.\n* **Insufficient Ablation Studies:** The paper lacks comprehensive ablation studies to understand the impact of key design choices, such as the size and architecture of the aggregator network, the data distribution in the proxy dataset, and the specific regularization techniques used.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Interesting Problem:** The paper tackles the important issue of period drift in FL, which has received relatively little attention in the literature.\n* **Clear Writing:** Despite some minor grammatical errors, the paper is generally well-written and easy to follow.\n\n**Overall:**\n\nWhile the paper presents an interesting idea, its lack of theoretical grounding, limited novelty, reliance on a potentially problematic proxy dataset, and weak empirical evaluation prevent it from being accepted at a top-tier conference.
