Additionally, the paper does not provide enough information on experimental settings, hyperparameters, and data splits, which hampers reproducibility.\n3. **Insufficient Analysis**: Several claims made in the paper are not backed by thorough analysis. For example, assertions about the performance of the deep multi-level model compared to other models lack quantitative support. The reviewers expressed a need for deeper insights into the results and the underlying mechanisms driving the observed behaviors.\n4. **Typos and Writing Quality**: The presence of numerous typos and grammatical errors detracts from the professionalism of the paper. This issue was highlighted by multiple reviewers and indicates a lack of careful proofreading.\n\n### Reviewer Consensus:\nThe reviewers are divided in their opinions. While some see potential in the research and its relevance, the majority express concerns about the clarity, completeness, and rigor of the experiments. Reviewer 4 explicitly states that the paper does not present new technical contributions and lacks adequate citations of related work. Reviewer 2 emphasizes the need for more comprehensive analysis and clearer experimental design.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the significant weaknesses in clarity, experimental rigor, and analysis, the paper does not meet the standards expected for publication at a top-tier conference. While the topic is important and the approach is innovative, the current state of the paper suggests that it requires substantial revisions and improvements before it can be considered for acceptance.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

The authors propose three different schemes for this task and develop a pipeline that includes source separation, transcription models, adversarial networks, and customized evaluation metrics.\n\n### Detailed Reasoning\n\n1. **Novelty and Contribution**: The paper claims to be the first to tackle unconditional singing voice generation, which is a significant contribution to the field. The exploration of three different generation schemes (free singer, accompanied singer, and solo singer) adds depth to the research. However, the novelty is somewhat undermined by the lack of a clear motivation for why these specific schemes were chosen and what insights can be gained from comparing their performances.\n\n2. **Evaluation Metrics**: A major concern raised by multiple reviewers is the evaluation of the generated singing voices. The proposed metrics (vocalness and average pitch) are criticized for not adequately capturing the essence of singing. Reviewers argue that these metrics do not reflect the quality of singing voice generation and that a more robust evaluation framework is needed. The absence of baseline comparisons further weakens the evaluation, making it difficult to assess the effectiveness of the proposed methods.\n\n3. **Dataset and Training Data**: The authors created their own dataset for training, which is commendable. However, the lack of clarity regarding the dataset's composition and the training process raises concerns. Reviewers pointed out that existing datasets could have been utilized for comparison, which would have strengthened the paper's claims. The ambiguity surrounding the training data and its impact on the results makes it challenging to evaluate the quality of the generated samples.\n\n4. **Literature Review and Context**: While the literature review is noted to be well-structured, several reviewers indicated that it could be improved, particularly regarding neural network-based singing voice synthesis.

The proposed methods aim to bridge this gap, which is a relevant and timely contribution.\n   \n2. **Empirical Results**: The paper reports strong empirical results, demonstrating that DDSS can achieve better FID scores with fewer sampling steps compared to existing methods. This is a compelling outcome that supports the practical applicability of the proposed approach.\n\n3. **Technical Contributions**: The introduction of GGDM as a flexible family of samplers and the optimization procedure for finding sampler variances are noteworthy contributions. The use of gradient rematerialization to manage computational costs is also a practical consideration.\n\n#### Weaknesses:\n1. **Theoretical Justification**: Several reviewers pointed out the lack of theoretical insights into the proposed methods. Specifically, the optimization of perceptual loss instead of maximizing ELBO raises questions about the underlying statistical properties of the generated samples. The paper would benefit from a more rigorous theoretical foundation to support its claims.\n\n2. **Clarity and Presentation**: Multiple reviewers noted issues with clarity, particularly in the introduction and the explanation of the proposed methods. The notation and terminology used could be confusing for readers, which detracts from the overall impact of the work.

The use of footnotes for important concepts and the lack of clear definitions hinder the reader's understanding. This is a critical issue for any academic paper, especially in a top-tier conference where clarity is paramount.\n\n2. **Insufficient Experimental Validation**: The experiments conducted are limited to simple toy datasets and MNIST. Reviewers emphasized the need for more complex datasets (e.g., CIFAR) to validate the proposed method's effectiveness. Additionally, there is a lack of comparison with existing state-of-the-art pruning techniques, which is essential to demonstrate the novelty and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.\n\n3. **Theoretical Foundation**: The paper heavily relies on an unpublished work by the authors, which raises concerns about the validity and verifiability of the proposed method. Reviewers noted that without access to this unpublished work, it is impossible to assess the correctness of the theoretical claims made in the paper. This lack of transparency is a significant drawback.\n\n4. **Novelty and Contribution**: While the authors claim to introduce a novel pruning technique, reviewers pointed out that the ideas presented (removing dead neurons and combining always-active neurons) are not particularly novel and have been explored in existing literature. The lack of a clear and compelling contribution diminishes the paper's impact.\n\n5. **Technical Issues**: Reviewers highlighted several technical issues, including unclear definitions, missing proofs, and vague explanations of the proposed algorithm. These issues further complicate the reader's ability to assess the validity of the claims made in the paper.\n\n6. **Typos and Grammatical Errors**: The presence of numerous typos and grammatical errors indicates a lack of thorough proofreading, which detracts from the professionalism of the submission.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the significant concerns regarding clarity, experimental validation, theoretical foundation, novelty, and technical rigor, the paper does not meet the standards expected for publication at a top-tier conference.

However, the reviewers express significant concerns regarding the simplicity of the discriminators used in the analysis. The linear and quadratic discriminators are seen as inadequate representations of the more complex neural network architectures typically employed in WGANs. This raises questions about the generalizability of the results to practical scenarios where WGANs are applied.\n\n2. **Theoretical Rigor**: While the theoretical analysis appears valid within the confines of the chosen models, the reviewers highlight that the simplifications made (i.e., using linear and quadratic discriminators) limit the applicability of the findings. The reviewers argue that the analysis does not capture the true nature of WGAN training, which relies on more complex discriminators to approximate the Wasserstein distance effectively.\n\n3. **Reviewer Concerns**: \n   - **Reviewer 1** emphasizes the lack of clarity on how the quadratic discriminator can be treated as a WGAN and criticizes the absence of a more complex two-layer network discriminator in the analysis.\n   - **Reviewer 2** acknowledges the importance of the contributions but maintains that the choice of simple discriminators detracts from the paper's impact. They suggest that results involving standard neural networks would be more valuable.\n   - **Reviewer 3** reiterates the limitations of the simple discriminators and points out that the results do not extend to more complex settings, which is a significant drawback.\n\n4. **Clarity and Presentation**: The paper is described as well-written, but the reviewers indicate that the claims made in the title and abstract could be misleading. The term \"one-layer network\" is particularly contentious, as it may not accurately represent the complexity of the models being discussed.\n\n5. **Experimental Validation**: While the authors claim to provide experimental results to support their theoretical findings, the reviewers do not mention the robustness or relevance of these experiments. Without strong empirical evidence, the theoretical claims remain unconvincing.\n\n### Conclusion\nGiven the significant concerns raised by multiple reviewers regarding the simplicity of the discriminators, the potential misleading nature of the claims, and the limited applicability of the results to real-world WGAN scenarios, the paper does not meet the standards expected for publication at a top-tier conference. The theoretical contributions, while interesting, are not sufficiently grounded in practical relevance, and the lack of a more comprehensive analysis of standard neural network discriminators limits the paper's impact.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

This is a relevant area of research, especially given the ongoing interest in alternatives to BP.\n2. **Clarity**: The paper is well-structured and generally clear, making it accessible to readers. The authors provide a reasonable theoretical foundation for their approach.\n3. **Potential Applications**: The proposed method could have implications for training RNNs on long sequences, which is a significant challenge in the field.\n\n### Weaknesses:\n1. **Theoretical Guarantees**: Multiple reviewers pointed out that the theoretical guarantees provided are not strong enough to justify the claims made about the superiority of TP over BP. The lack of rigorous analysis regarding the convergence and performance of the proposed method is a significant concern.\n2. **Empirical Evidence**: The experimental results are not convincing. Reviewer 3 highlighted that the performance on standard datasets like CIFAR-10 is weak, and the results do not demonstrate a clear advantage over BP. The experiments lack depth and do not sufficiently compare the proposed method against a broader range of existing algorithms.\n3. **Limited Scope**: The proposed algorithm appears to lose many of the attractive features of TP, such as optimization without weight transport, which limits its applicability. Reviewers noted that the algorithm's complexity is higher than BP, which raises questions about its practicality in real-world applications.\n4. **Insufficient Comparison with Existing Work**: The paper does not adequately contextualize its contributions within the existing literature on RNN optimization and TP. Reviewers suggested that a more comprehensive comparison with other methods would strengthen the paper.\n\n### Reviewer Consensus:\nThe reviewers generally agree that while the paper presents an interesting idea, it falls short in both theoretical and empirical validation. The concerns about the lack of strong theoretical backing and the insufficient experimental results are significant enough to warrant skepticism about the paper's contributions.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the weaknesses identified, particularly in the theoretical guarantees and empirical validation, the paper does not meet the standards expected for acceptance at a top-tier conference.

The authors claim that their method can provide a richer characterization of neuron-level computation, which is a significant contribution to the field of interpretability in deep learning.\n\n#### Strengths:\n1. **Technical Contribution**: The introduction of MILAN is a noteworthy advancement in the interpretability of deep learning models. The ability to generate natural language descriptions that capture various levels of abstraction (low-level features like edges to high-level features like objects) is a valuable tool for researchers and practitioners.\n   \n2. **Empirical Validation**: The authors provide empirical evidence demonstrating that MILAN achieves higher agreement with human annotations compared to baseline methods across different architectures and tasks. This suggests that the method is robust and generalizable.\n\n3. **Applications**: The paper outlines three practical applications of the MILAN method: analysis, auditing, and editing of models. This versatility enhances the significance of the work.\n\n4. **Clarity and Presentation**: The paper is well-written and structured, making it accessible to readers. The authors have committed to open-sourcing their data, code, and models, which is a positive aspect for reproducibility.\n\n#### Weaknesses:\n1. **Inter-Annotator Agreement**: Reviewer 2 raises a valid concern regarding the inter-annotator agreement in the MILANNOTATIONS dataset. The authors should clarify how they handled inconsistencies in human annotations, as this could impact the quality of the training data.\n\n2. **Scope of Experiments**: Several reviewers noted that the experiments are primarily focused on image data.

The authors argue that their method improves upon existing techniques, particularly unlikelihood training (UL), by explicitly distinguishing between positive and negative tokens during training.\n\n### Detailed Reasoning\n\n1. **Novelty and Contribution**:\n   - The reviewers unanimously express concerns regarding the novelty of the proposed method. Reviewer 1 highlights that the contributions are incremental and that the core idea of penalizing previously generated tokens is not new, as it has been explored in UL. Reviewers 3 and 4 also echo this sentiment, stating that the contributions lack significant novelty.\n   - While the authors present a new perspective on the training objective, the lack of substantial differentiation from existing methods like UL raises questions about the paper's overall contribution to the field.\n\n2. **Experimental Validation**:\n   - The experimental setup has been criticized for being insufficient. Reviewers 1 and 2 point out that the experiments are primarily conducted on a small model (GPT-2 small) and do not include larger models or more diverse tasks, which limits the generalizability of the findings. The metrics used for evaluation, particularly perplexity, are also questioned, as they may not accurately reflect the quality of generated text.\n   - The lack of statistical significance in human evaluations further undermines the claims made by the authors regarding the superiority of their method over existing approaches.\n\n3. **Clarity and Quality**:\n   - The paper is noted for its clarity and ease of understanding, which is a positive aspect. However, clarity alone does not compensate for the lack of novelty and insufficient experimental validation.\n\n4. **Reproducibility**:\n   - The authors have provided code and resources for reproducibility, which is commendable. However, the reproducibility of results does not mitigate the concerns regarding the novelty and empirical validation of the proposed method.\n\n5. **Reviewer Consensus**:\n   - The consensus among the reviewers leans towards rejection, primarily due to the thin novelty and insufficient experimental evidence.

The authors claim that their approach can lead to the development of high-level agents with varied playing styles, which is a relevant and challenging problem in the field of RL, particularly in complex games.\n\n#### Strengths:\n1. **Relevance and Challenge**: The topic of maintaining diverse playing styles in self-play is significant in the context of RL, especially for complex games. The authors address a known limitation of traditional self-play methods, which often lead to overfitting to a narrow set of strategies.\n2. **Empirical Results**: The experiments conducted in two different game environments (Pong and Justice Online) show that the proposed method can yield competitive results against other population-based agents and RL baselines. This suggests that the approach has practical applicability.\n3. **Clarity and Structure**: The paper is generally well-written and structured, making it accessible to readers. The methodology is described in sufficient detail to allow for reproducibility.\n\n#### Weaknesses:\n1. **Literature Review and Baselines**: A significant oversight is the lack of discussion regarding relevant literature, particularly the work by Lanctot et al. (2017) on multi-agent RL and self-play algorithms. This omission weakens the paper's foundation and could have provided valuable context and comparison for the proposed method. Additionally, the absence of comparisons to established quality-diversity algorithms (e.g., MAP-Elites) limits the robustness of the empirical findings.\n2. **Experimental Design Issues**: The experimental design raises concerns about fairness and representativeness. The sampling method for opponents in the experiments may introduce bias, favoring certain agents due to their larger representation in the pool. This could skew the results and make it difficult to ascertain the true effectiveness of the proposed method.\n3. **Simplification of Playing Style**: The reduction of playing style to a single scalar value is a significant simplification that may overlook the complexity of agent behaviors. This aspect should have been more thoroughly discussed, as it could limit the applicability of the findings to more complex scenarios.\n4. **Limited Domains**: The experiments are conducted in only two game environments, which may not sufficiently demonstrate the generalizability of the proposed approach. Including additional benchmark domains would strengthen the claims made in the paper.\n\n#### Reviewer Consensus:\nThe reviewers provided a mix of positive and negative feedback. While they acknowledged the potential of the proposed method and its clarity, they also highlighted critical weaknesses, particularly regarding the literature review, experimental design, and the need for broader empirical validation.\n\n### Conclusion\nGiven the strengths of the paper in addressing a relevant problem and providing promising empirical results, it shows potential for contribution to the field.

(2020). The paper does not sufficiently clarify the technical challenges overcome in extending these results, which raises questions about the originality of the contributions.\n2. **Overclaims and Lack of Insight**: Reviewer 6 pointed out that the title and abstract may overstate the applicability of the results, as they primarily focus on overparameterized models. The authors need to clarify the limitations of their results and provide more discussion on the implications of overparameterization.\n3. **Minor Issues and Suggestions for Improvement**: Several reviewers noted minor issues in the paper, such as the need for clearer definitions, corrections in equations, and suggestions for improving figures. While these do not fundamentally undermine the paper, they indicate that the authors should refine their work before publication.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile the paper presents some interesting results and is well-written, the concerns regarding the novelty of the contributions and the potential overclaims in the title and abstract are significant. The reviewers' feedback suggests that the paper may not meet the high standards expected at a top-tier conference, particularly in terms of originality and depth of discussion. \n\nGiven these considerations, I recommend that the authors address the reviewers' concerns and resubmit the paper after making the necessary improvements.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

The authors claim that their model, the Variational Neural Cellular Automata (VNCA), can generate diverse outputs while maintaining robustness against perturbations. However, the reviewers' comments reveal a mixed reception regarding the paper's contributions, novelty, and empirical results.\n\n**Strengths:**\n1. **Writing Quality:** Multiple reviewers noted that the paper is well-written and clear, making it accessible to readers. This is an important aspect for publication in a top-tier conference.\n2. **Novelty in Approach:** The integration of NCAs into a variational framework is a fresh perspective that could contribute to the understanding of generative models and self-organization.\n3. **Robustness Experiments:** The experiments demonstrating the model's robustness to perturbations were highlighted as interesting and valuable.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n1. **Underwhelming Experimental Results:** Several reviewers pointed out that the experimental results, particularly on datasets like CelebA and Noto Emoji, are significantly behind the state-of-the-art (SOTA). This raises concerns about the practical applicability of the VNCA.\n2. **Limited Novelty:** Reviewers expressed skepticism about the novelty of the contributions. Some argued that the findings could be seen as straightforward consequences of existing deep convolutional networks rather than groundbreaking insights.\n3. **Lack of Clarity on Motivation:** The motivation behind the architectural choices and the specific problems the VNCA addresses compared to prior work was not sufficiently articulated, leading to questions about its significance.\n4. **Need for More Comprehensive Comparisons:** Reviewers suggested that the authors should provide more comparisons with existing methods, particularly in terms of performance metrics like log-likelihood and sample quality.\n\n**Reviewer Consensus:**\n- Reviewer 1 and Reviewer 4 leaned towards rejection due to the underwhelming experimental results and lack of clear motivation.\n- Reviewer 2 acknowledged the value of bridging literature but maintained concerns about the novelty of claims.\n- Reviewer 3 and Reviewer 5 were more favorable, especially after the authors addressed their comments, but still noted limitations in experimental results.\n- Reviewer 6 and Reviewer 7 raised significant concerns about the novelty and the implications of the findings, suggesting that the contributions may not be substantial enough for acceptance.\n\n### Conclusion\nWhile the paper presents an interesting approach and is well-written, the significant concerns regarding the experimental results, clarity of motivation, and the novelty of contributions weigh heavily against acceptance.

      "response": "The paper titled \"MCTransformer: Combining Transformers And Monte-Carlo Tree Search For Offline Reinforcement Learning\" presents a novel framework that integrates Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with Transformers in the context of offline reinforcement learning, specifically applied to the game SameGame. While the concept of combining these two methodologies is intriguing and has potential implications for the field, the reviewers have raised several significant concerns that must be addressed.\n\n### Detailed Reasoning:\n\n1. **Novelty and Originality**:\n   - Reviewer 1 acknowledges the originality of the idea but points out that the execution lacks empirical support and clarity. Reviewers 2 and 3 express skepticism about the novelty, suggesting that the approach is merely a variation of existing methods like AlphaGo/AlphaZero, with the only change being the replacement of the neural network architecture.\n   - The reviewers collectively highlight that the paper does not sufficiently differentiate itself from existing literature, particularly in how it applies the Transformer architecture in conjunction with MCTS.\n\n2. **Empirical Evaluation**:\n   - A major weakness noted by all reviewers is the limited empirical evaluation. The experiments are conducted solely on the SameGame domain, which is considered relatively toy-like and non-standard. There is a strong consensus that the paper should include comparisons with more established benchmarks and algorithms, such as AlphaZero or other MCTS-based methods.\n   - The reviewers also point out that the comparisons made are unfair, as the MCTS component does not utilize a learned prior policy or value function, which is a standard practice in the field. This raises questions about the validity of the performance claims made by the authors.\n\n3. **Clarity and Presentation**:\n   - The clarity of the writing and presentation is another significant concern. Reviewers have noted that the paper is difficult to follow, with unclear exposition and numerous typographical errors. This lack of clarity detracts from the overall quality of the work and makes it challenging for readers to fully grasp the proposed methodology and its implications.\n\n4. **Reproducibility**:\n   - While the reviewers agree that the paper provides sufficient information for reproducibility, the lack of source code availability is a drawback. This is particularly important in the context of machine learning research, where reproducibility is a key factor in validating results.\n\n5. **Potential for Improvement**:\n   - Despite the criticisms, there is a recognition that the underlying idea has merit and could lead to valuable contributions if the issues raised are addressed. The reviewers suggest that with more rigorous empirical validation, clearer exposition, and a broader range of comparisons, the paper could be significantly improved.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the substantial concerns regarding novelty, empirical evaluation, clarity, and presentation, it is clear that the paper is not ready for acceptance at this time. The reviewers have provided constructive feedback that, if addressed, could enhance the quality and impact of the research. Therefore, the appropriate decision is to reject the paper in its current form.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

The authors claim that placing BN after bounded activation functions (the \"Swap model\") leads to improved performance compared to the conventional order (BN before activation). They attribute this performance improvement to the phenomenon of asymmetric saturation and increased sparsity.\n\n### Strengths:\n1. **Novel Observation**: The paper identifies a counterintuitive result that the order of BN and activation functions can significantly impact performance, particularly with bounded activations. This is a relevant and timely topic in deep learning research.\n2. **Empirical Analysis**: The authors conduct extensive experiments across various architectures and activation functions, providing a solid empirical foundation for their claims.\n3. **Quantitative Metrics**: The introduction of metrics to evaluate saturation and sparsity adds a quantitative dimension to the analysis, which is beneficial for understanding the underlying mechanisms.\n\n### Weaknesses:\n1. **Lack of Clarity and Rigor**: Multiple reviewers pointed out that several claims made in the paper are not well-supported or clearly articulated. For instance, the relationship between asymmetric saturation and generalization performance is not convincingly established. The paper often lacks rigorous definitions and explanations, which could lead to confusion.\n2. **Limited Generalizability**: The analysis is primarily focused on bounded activation functions and does not adequately address how these findings might extend to other widely used activation functions like ReLU. This limits the practical applicability of the results.\n3. **Contradictory Observations**: Some reviewers noted inconsistencies in the results, particularly regarding saturation and sparsity across different layers. The authors need to clarify these observations and their implications for the overall conclusions.\n4. **Insufficient Discussion of Limitations**: The paper does not sufficiently discuss the limitations of the findings, such as the potential for overfitting or the specific contexts in which the Swap model might be beneficial.\n\n### Reviewer Concerns:\n- Several reviewers expressed doubts about the robustness of the claims regarding generalization performance and the role of saturation and sparsity. They highlighted the need for more comprehensive analysis and discussion of alternative explanations for the observed performance improvements.\n- The paper's empirical contributions, while interesting, do not significantly advance the field, especially given that the Swap model does not outperform conventional models using ReLU.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile the paper presents an intriguing observation and conducts a thorough empirical analysis, the lack of clarity, rigor, and generalizability, combined with the concerns raised by multiple reviewers, suggests that the paper does not meet the high standards expected for publication at a top-tier conference. The arguments supporting the conclusions are weak, and the paper would benefit from further refinement and clarification.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

This approach, termed Functional Risk Minimization (FRM), aims to provide a more realistic representation of noise in data and claims to outperform traditional Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) under certain conditions.\n\n### Strengths:\n1. **Novelty**: The concept of modeling each data point with its own function is innovative and could significantly impact how noise is treated in machine learning models. This could lead to better performance in real-world datasets where noise is not uniformly distributed.\n2. **Empirical Results**: The paper provides empirical evidence suggesting that FRM outperforms ERM in specific scenarios, particularly in regression tasks with non-uniform noise. This is a promising indication of the framework's potential applicability.\n\n### Weaknesses:\n1. **Theoretical Foundations**: Multiple reviewers pointed out that the theoretical underpinnings of the proposed algorithm are not sufficiently developed. There is a lack of formal derivation connecting the algorithm to the theoretical framework, which raises concerns about its validity and applicability.\n2. **Scalability Issues**: The algorithm's scalability is questioned, particularly due to the reliance on approximations and Hessian information, which may not be feasible for larger models. This is a critical concern for practical applications.\n3. **Clarity and Presentation**: The paper has been criticized for its clarity. The terminology used (e.g., ERM and FRM) is confusing and not aligned with standard definitions in the literature. This could hinder readers' understanding and acceptance of the proposed ideas.\n4. **Experimental Evaluation**: There is a lack of comprehensive experimental evaluation, particularly for the functional generative model, which limits the paper's ability to demonstrate the full potential of the proposed framework.\n\n### Reviewer Consensus:\n- Reviewer 1 expressed significant concerns regarding the connection between the theoretical and algorithmic aspects, as well as the clarity of presentation. They ultimately recommended rejection.\n- Reviewer 2 acknowledged the interesting ideas but highlighted confusion regarding the relationship between FRM and Bayesian models, suggesting that more discussion is needed. They also noted the lack of experimental evaluation for the generative model.\n- Reviewer 3 found the paper to be well-written and of high quality but raised concerns about the computational cost and the necessity of FRM over modified ERM.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile the paper presents a novel and potentially impactful framework, the significant issues regarding theoretical justification, clarity, and scalability raise concerns about its readiness for publication. The lack of comprehensive experimental validation further compounds these issues. Given the mixed reviews, with two reviewers leaning towards rejection due to substantial concerns and one being more favorable but still noting weaknesses, it is clear that the paper requires substantial revisions to address these critical points.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

The authors aim to address the trade-off between model performance and reliable validation set evaluation, which is a relevant and significant issue in the field of machine learning.\n\n### Strengths:\n1. **Relevance of the Problem**: The issue of validation set construction is indeed a critical one in machine learning, especially in real-world applications where data is often limited. The proposed method attempts to tackle this problem, which is commendable.\n2. **Novelty of Approach**: The introduction of the Proximal Validation Protocol (PVP) is a novel contribution that leverages data augmentation to create a validation set without sacrificing training data. This is an interesting approach that could have implications for model evaluation practices.\n\n### Weaknesses:\n1. **Lack of Theoretical Justification**: Several reviewers pointed out that the paper lacks a solid theoretical foundation. The authors do not provide sufficient justification for why the constructed proximal validation set is representative of the underlying data distribution. This is a significant concern, as the validity of the proposed method hinges on this assumption.\n2. **Empirical Evaluation**: The empirical results presented in the paper are criticized for being based on small datasets, which may not adequately support the claims made. Reviewers suggested that the authors should evaluate their method on larger, more diverse datasets to strengthen their findings. Additionally, the lack of statistical significance in the results raises questions about the robustness of the claims.\n3. **Clarity and Presentation**: Multiple reviewers noted that the paper's presentation could be improved. The experiments, in particular, were described as unclear, making it difficult to assess the contributions of the proposed method. The use of terminology and metrics was also criticized for being ambiguous or poorly defined.\n4. **Limited Scope of Evaluation**: The reviewers expressed concerns about the applicability of PVP beyond classification tasks. The authors should clarify whether their method can be generalized to other types of machine learning problems, such as regression or unsupervised learning.\n\n### Reviewer Consensus:\nThe consensus among the reviewers leans towards rejection, primarily due to the lack of theoretical support and insufficient empirical validation. While the problem addressed is important and the proposed solution is novel, the execution and presentation of the research do not meet the standards expected at a top-tier conference.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the significant weaknesses identified in the theoretical justification, empirical evaluation, and clarity of presentation, I believe that the paper does not currently meet the criteria for acceptance. The authors would need to address these critical issues in order to strengthen their contribution to the field.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

The authors introduce a method called ProtSeed, which utilizes a trigonometry-aware encoder and a roto-translation equivariant decoder to facilitate the co-design of protein sequences and structures. The experimental results indicate that ProtSeed outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in terms of inference speed and design fidelity.\n\n#### Strengths:\n1. **Novelty and Relevance**: The paper tackles a significant problem in bioengineering, specifically the co-design of protein sequences and structures, which is a hot topic in the field. The proposed method shows promise in improving the efficiency of protein design.\n2. **Empirical Results**: The authors provide strong empirical evidence demonstrating that ProtSeed outperforms existing methods across multiple tasks. This is a crucial aspect for acceptance in a top-tier conference.\n3. **Clear Methodology**: The methodology is presented clearly, and the iterative refinement process is a notable improvement over traditional autoregressive methods.\n\n#### Weaknesses:\n1. **Claims of Novelty**: Several reviewers raised concerns about the novelty of the approach, suggesting that it closely resembles existing methods, particularly AlphaFold2. The authors' claim of being the \"first\" in protein sequence-structure co-design is contested, as similar methods exist.\n2. **Lack of Detail**: Reviewers pointed out the absence of specific hyperparameter settings, training details, and the release of code/models, which are essential for reproducibility. This is a significant drawback for a top-tier conference submission.\n3. **Discrepancies with Prior Work**: There are concerns regarding the reported performance metrics compared to existing models, particularly the RMSD scores. Addressing these discrepancies is crucial for validating the claims made in the paper.\n4. **Functional Evaluation**: While the paper provides metrics like PPL, RMSD, and AAR, there is a lack of functional-oriented evaluation, which is critical for assessing the practical applicability of the designed proteins.\n\n#### Reviewer Consensus:\nThe reviewers are divided in their opinions. Some express strong support for acceptance based on the empirical results and the relevance of the work, while others highlight significant concerns regarding the novelty, clarity of claims, and reproducibility. The mixed feedback indicates that while the paper has merit, it also has substantial areas that need improvement.\n\n### Conclusion\nGiven the strengths of the paper, particularly in empirical performance and relevance to the field, it has the potential to make a valuable contribution.

      "response": "The paper titled \"Online black-box adaptation to label-shift in the presence of conditional-shift\" addresses a relevant and timely problem in machine learning: adapting predictive models to distribution shifts that occur in real-world applications. The authors propose heuristics to improve existing methods for label shift adaptation, particularly in the context of online learning and regression tasks. However, the paper has several significant weaknesses that raise concerns about its readiness for publication in a top-tier conference.\n\n### Detailed Reasoning:\n\n1. **Novelty and Contribution**: \n   - The paper attempts to extend existing methods for label shift adaptation by introducing heuristics for scenarios where conditional shifts are present. However, reviewers consistently noted that the contributions are marginally significant or novel. The proposed heuristics do not demonstrate substantial improvements over the original methods, and some are considered common practices in the field. This lack of clear advancement diminishes the paper's impact.\n\n2. **Empirical Validation**:\n   - The empirical studies presented in the paper do not convincingly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. Reviewers pointed out that the results often do not show significant improvements over baseline methods, and in some cases, the proposed methods perform worse. The experiments are described as modest and lacking in variety, which limits the generalizability of the findings. A more comprehensive empirical study with a wider range of distribution shifts and comparisons to established baselines is necessary to substantiate the claims made.\n\n3. **Clarity and Presentation**:\n   - The paper suffers from clarity issues, with several reviewers highlighting that key concepts and methods are not well-defined or explained. Important terms like \"conditional shift\" are not adequately defined, and the notation used throughout the paper can be confusing. This lack of clarity makes it difficult for readers to fully grasp the methodology and results, which is a critical aspect of academic writing.\n\n4. **Theoretical Justification**:\n   - Reviewers noted that the heuristics proposed lack theoretical support, which is essential for establishing their validity. The absence of a solid theoretical foundation raises questions about the reliability of the methods and their applicability in practice. Without this justification, the heuristics may appear ad-hoc and unconvincing.\n\n5. **Response to Reviewer Comments**:\n   - The authors' responses to reviewer comments do not sufficiently address the concerns raised. While they acknowledge some limitations, they do not provide a clear plan for how to improve the paper or expand on the empirical studies. This lack of engagement with the feedback suggests that the authors may not be fully committed to addressing the fundamental issues identified by the reviewers.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the paper's marginal contributions, insufficient empirical validation, clarity issues, lack of theoretical justification, and inadequate responses to reviewer feedback, it does not meet the standards expected for publication in a top-tier conference. The authors would benefit from conducting a more thorough investigation into their proposed methods, providing clearer explanations, and establishing a stronger theoretical basis for their work.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

The authors aim to quantify the performance of these dynamics through average performance metrics, which is a relevant and timely topic in the intersection of machine learning and game theory.\n\n### Strengths:\n1. **Relevance of the Topic**: The study addresses a significant gap in the literature regarding the quality of equilibria reached by learning dynamics, which is crucial for both theoretical and practical applications in game theory.\n2. **Clarity and Structure**: The paper is generally well-written, with a clear motivation and explanation of the methods used. The empirical results are presented in a visually appealing manner, which aids in understanding the findings.\n3. **Solid Results**: The results, particularly regarding the comparison between different dynamics, are mathematically sound and well-supported.\n\n### Weaknesses:\n1. **Incremental Contribution**: Several reviewers pointed out that the contributions of the paper appear to be incremental, particularly in light of prior work (PP16). The lack of a thorough comparison with this prior work raises concerns about the novelty of the findings.\n2. **Limited Scope**: The focus on symmetric 2x2 coordination games is seen as a significant limitation. While the authors provide some results for this case, the generalization to broader classes of games is not adequately addressed, leaving the reader questioning the applicability of the results.\n3. **Insufficient Formal Treatment**: Reviewers noted that many results are presented in a preliminary manner, lacking the depth and rigor expected at a top-tier conference. The absence of formal proofs for some claims diminishes the overall impact of the work.\n4. **Citation and Formatting Issues**: There are concerns regarding the citation practices and formatting, which detract from the professionalism of the submission.\n\n### Reviewer Consensus:\nThe reviewers are divided in their opinions. While some see potential in the paper and recommend acceptance, others express significant reservations about its novelty and the completeness of the results.

While the motivation for using structural embeddings is well-founded, the reviewers have raised several significant concerns regarding the novelty, clarity, and empirical contributions of the work.\n\n### Detailed Reasoning:\n\n1. **Novelty and Contribution**:\n   - Multiple reviewers (1, 2, 3, and 4) have pointed out that the contributions of the paper are limited. The primary innovation appears to be the application of existing pretrained embeddings from OmegaFold without substantial modifications or novel methodologies. This raises questions about the originality of the work, as it does not introduce a new approach to embedding generation or a novel GNN architecture.\n   - The reviewers noted that the method does not significantly advance the state of the art in PPI prediction, as it primarily combines existing techniques rather than proposing a new framework or model.\n\n2. **Empirical Evaluation**:\n   - The empirical results presented in the paper show only marginal improvements over existing methods, which is a critical aspect for acceptance in a top-tier conference. Reviewers highlighted that the improvements (around 5%) are not compelling enough to justify the novelty of the approach.\n   - There is a lack of comprehensive comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, such as AlphaFold-Multimer and other relevant baselines. This omission makes it difficult to assess the effectiveness of the proposed method in the context of existing literature.\n\n3. **Clarity and Presentation**:\n   - Reviewers expressed concerns about the clarity of the paper. Specific questions regarding the setup of the binary classification problem, the interpretation of AUC in this context, and the presentation of results (e.g., lack of confidence intervals) indicate that the paper could benefit from significant improvements in clarity and organization.\n   - The reviewers also pointed out that the tables and figures could be better formatted to enhance readability and comprehension.\n\n4. **Technical Issues**:\n   - Several technical issues were raised, including the choice of baselines, the unclear design of the model, and the methodology for negative sampling. These issues suggest that the paper lacks rigor in its experimental design and analysis, which is crucial for a top-tier conference submission.\n\n5. **Reviewer Consensus**:\n   - The consensus among the reviewers is that while the motivation for the research is valid, the execution falls short in terms of novelty, empirical significance, and clarity. The paper does not sufficiently advance the field of PPI prediction or provide a compelling new methodology.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the limited novelty, marginal empirical contributions, and clarity issues highlighted by the reviewers, the paper does not meet the standards expected for acceptance at a top-tier conference. The authors would need to address these significant concerns and provide a more substantial contribution to the field before resubmission.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

The reviewers provided a range of comments, highlighting both strengths and weaknesses of the work.\n\n### Detailed Reasoning:\n\n1. **Novelty and Contribution**:\n   - The reviewers generally agree that the novelty of the proposed approach is limited. Reviewer 1 notes that splitting a neural network into two parts is not a new concept, while Reviewer 2 points out that the core idea is similar to existing methods like split learning, which was not adequately referenced. This lack of novelty is a significant concern for a top-tier conference, where groundbreaking contributions are expected.\n\n2. **Technical Flaws**:\n   - Reviewer 2 raises critical issues regarding the technical implementation of the proposed method. The concerns about the server's ability to reconstruct the encoder and the potential for model inversion attacks indicate that the proposed privacy guarantees may not hold under scrutiny. This undermines the paper's claims and suggests that the proposed method may not be robust against real-world threats.\n\n3. **Experimental Evaluation**:\n   - The experimental setup is criticized for being simplistic and lacking diversity in datasets and models. Reviewer 1 mentions that only two datasets were used, and the comparisons with other baselines are insufficient. Reviewer 2 also suggests that the models evaluated are relatively shallow and do not represent the complexity of modern architectures. This limited empirical evaluation raises questions about the generalizability and effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\n4. **Clarity and Quality**:\n   - While the paper is described as clear and easy to read, several reviewers pointed out grammatical errors and ambiguous statements that detract from the overall quality. The lack of a well-defined security model and the potential for information leakage from encoded features further complicate the clarity of the proposed approach.\n\n5. **Reproducibility**:\n   - Although some aspects of reproducibility are addressed, such as hyperparameter settings, critical details like the choice of optimizers and training epochs are missing. This lack of comprehensive methodological detail could hinder other researchers from replicating the results.\n\n6. **Overall Impression**:\n   - The consensus among the reviewers is that the paper presents an incremental contribution with significant technical flaws and limited empirical validation. The concerns regarding the robustness of the privacy guarantees and the overall novelty of the approach suggest that the paper does not meet the high standards expected at a top-tier conference.\n\nGiven these considerations, the paper does not sufficiently advance the field or provide a compelling solution to the stated problem. The combination of limited novelty, technical flaws, and inadequate experimental validation leads to the conclusion that the paper should not be accepted for publication.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

The authors argue that their method, which incorporates language throughout the visual processing pipeline, offers improvements over traditional top-down approaches.\n\n### Detailed Reasoning\n\n1. **Novelty and Contribution**: \n   - The paper proposes a new method that integrates language at both low and high levels of visual processing. However, several reviewers noted that the novelty of the approach is not sufficiently clear. Reviewer 1 mentioned that the contribution feels thin, as many modeling techniques for language were not explored. Reviewer 4 echoed this sentiment, stating that the paper lacks a clear conceptual motivation and does not convincingly demonstrate a significant conceptual contribution. The originality of the model compared to existing works, particularly Step-ConvRNN, is also questioned.\n\n2. **Empirical Results**:\n   - While the paper reports state-of-the-art or competitive results on some datasets, Reviewer 2 pointed out that the model struggles on certain metrics, raising concerns about overfitting. The inconsistency in results across different tables (as noted by Reviewer 2) and the lack of statistical significance tests further undermine the reliability of the empirical claims. Reviewer 4 also highlighted the variability in results and the absence of a satisfactory analysis of the model's performance, which is crucial for validating the claims made.\n\n3. **Clarity and Presentation**:\n   - The paper is generally well-written, and the reviewers found it easy to follow. However, several suggestions for improving clarity were made, such as adding figures to explain concepts and providing more detailed descriptions of the ablation studies. These suggestions indicate that while the paper is understandable, it could benefit from additional clarity in presenting its methodology and results.\n\n4. **Reviewer Concerns**:\n   - Multiple reviewers raised significant concerns about the conceptual grounding of the model and the lack of thorough analysis regarding how linguistic representations interact with visual features. Reviewer 4 specifically called for a more detailed error analysis and a clearer understanding of the model's contributions. The absence of such analyses makes it difficult to assess the true impact of the proposed method.\n\n5. **Rebuttal and Author Responses**:\n   - The authors' responses to reviewer comments did not satisfactorily address the concerns raised, particularly regarding the empirical results and the lack of clarity in the model's contributions. This failure to adequately respond to critical feedback further diminishes the paper's standing.\n\n### Conclusion\nGiven the concerns regarding the novelty and significance of the contributions, the empirical results' reliability, and the lack of thorough analysis and clarity, I believe that the paper does not meet the standards expected for publication at a top-tier conference.

The evaluation is conducted on several benchmarks, including a new imbalanced variant of Permuted MNIST.\n\n### Strengths:\n1. **Novelty and Relevance**: The paper tackles a significant problem in machine learning—catastrophic forgetting—using a fresh perspective inspired by Hebbian learning and cognitive principles. The integration of fast and slow weights is a compelling approach that adds to the existing literature.\n   \n2. **Implementation and Accessibility**: The authors provide pseudocode in PyTorch, which enhances the accessibility of their method for practitioners and researchers. This is a positive aspect as it encourages reproducibility.\n\n3. **Initial Results**: The results indicate that the proposed method outperforms some baselines, which is a promising outcome for a new approach.\n\n### Weaknesses:\n1. **Empirical Evaluation**: Multiple reviewers pointed out that the empirical evaluation is not sufficiently robust. Reviewer 1 specifically noted that the DHP Softmax does not perform as well as established methods like SI on more complex datasets. The lack of comprehensive comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods, particularly in the context of class-incremental learning, raises concerns about the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\n2. **Clarity and Presentation**: Several reviewers expressed confusion regarding the technical details of the DHP Softmax, including the definitions of terms and the mathematical formulations. This suggests that the paper may not be sufficiently clear for readers who are not deeply familiar with the underlying concepts.\n\n3. **Limited Scope of Experiments**: The reviewers highlighted the need for a broader range of experiments, particularly on more challenging datasets like CIFAR-100 or ILSVRC. The current experiments are seen as insufficient to demonstrate the scalability and robustness of the proposed method in diverse continual learning scenarios.\n\n4. **Performance Relative to Other Methods**: Reviewer 4 noted that while the method shows promise, it does not significantly outperform existing synaptic consolidation methods. This raises questions about the added value of the proposed approach.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile the paper presents a novel approach to a relevant problem and shows some initial promise, the concerns regarding empirical evaluation, clarity, and the need for more comprehensive experiments are significant.

The authors claim that their dataset will serve as a reliable benchmark for precipitation nowcasting models and can be utilized in other machine learning tasks.\n\n### Detailed Reasoning\n\n1. **Dataset Contribution**: The primary contribution of the paper is the introduction of the RuDar dataset, which includes detailed 3D radar measurements. Reviewers generally agree that the dataset is rich and valuable, particularly because it covers multiple altitudes and a significant temporal range. However, the novelty of the dataset is questioned, as it appears to be similar to existing datasets in terms of its overall utility for precipitation nowcasting.\n\n2. **Evaluation of Baseline Models**: The authors evaluate several baseline models, including optical flow and neural networks, but the reviewers express concerns about the choice of models. Reviewer 2 specifically notes that the baseline methods seem naïve and lack more sophisticated models, such as transformer architectures, which could provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the dataset's potential. Additionally, the evaluation metrics used (MSE) are criticized for not adequately reflecting the accuracy of precipitation nowcasting.\n\n3. **Clarity and Reproducibility**: The paper is noted for its clarity and ease of understanding. The methodology is described well enough for reproducibility, which is a positive aspect. However, the lack of methodological novelty in the approaches used for evaluation is a significant drawback.\n\n4. **Technical and Empirical Novelty**: Reviewers consistently rate the technical and empirical novelty of the contributions as marginal.

      "response": "The paper titled \"NORML: Nodal Optimization for Recurrent Meta-Learning\" presents a novel framework for meta-learning that aims to address scalability issues in existing methods. The proposed approach utilizes an LSTM-based meta-learner to optimize neuron-wise updates for a learner network, which is claimed to allow for efficient task learning with fewer parameters in the meta-learner relative to the learner network.\n\n### Detailed Reasoning\n\n1. **Novelty and Contribution**: \n   - The reviewers unanimously express concerns regarding the novelty of the proposed method. Reviewer 3 highlights that NORML is an incremental variation of the Meta-Learner LSTM by Ravi & Larochelle, and calls for a direct comparison to validate its advantages. Reviewer 1 also points out that the paper does not adequately differentiate its contributions from existing work, particularly in terms of parameter scaling.\n   - The lack of a comprehensive comparison with the Meta-Learner LSTM, especially under similar experimental conditions, raises questions about the claimed benefits of NORML. The reviewers suggest that the authors should provide a clearer justification for their approach and demonstrate its superiority through rigorous experiments.\n\n2. **Experimental Validation**:\n   - The experimental results presented in the paper are criticized for being insufficient and not convincing. Reviewer 1 notes that the results from Sun et al. are not included, despite their relevance, and that the experiments on Omniglot do not utilize a convolutional network, which limits the applicability of the findings.\n   - Reviewer 2 mentions that the writing quality detracts from the scientific rigor of the paper, with numerous grammatical errors and unclear descriptions that hinder comprehension. This is a significant issue for a top-tier conference where clarity and precision are paramount.\n\n3. **Technical Issues**:\n   - Several reviewers point out inaccuracies in the descriptions of prior work, particularly regarding the parameterization of the Meta-Learner LSTM and the claims about Andrychowicz et al. These inaccuracies undermine the credibility of the paper and suggest a lack of thorough literature review.\n   - The reviewers also highlight the need for additional baselines and comparisons, particularly with MAML and its variants, to provide a more robust evaluation of NORML's performance.\n\n4. **Applicability**:\n   - Reviewer 3 raises concerns about the limited applicability of NORML, as it is designed specifically for fully connected networks. This restriction may hinder its adoption in broader contexts where convolutional architectures are prevalent.\n\n5. **Writing Quality**:\n   - The overall writing quality is deemed inadequate by multiple reviewers, with calls for a significant overhaul to meet the standards expected at a top-tier conference. This includes addressing grammatical errors, improving the flow of ideas, and ensuring accurate citations.\n\n### Conclusion\nGiven the concerns raised by the reviewers regarding the novelty, experimental validation, technical accuracy, and writing quality, it is clear that the paper does not meet the high standards required for acceptance at a top-tier conference. The authors need to address the significant issues highlighted, particularly in terms of providing a clearer contribution to the field, conducting more rigorous experiments, and improving the overall presentation of the work.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

      "response": "The paper titled \"Learning to Transfer via Modelling Multi-level Task Dependency\" proposes a novel multi-task learning framework that aims to improve performance by modeling the relationships among tasks at multiple levels. While the concept of leveraging task dependencies is valid and potentially impactful, the reviewers have raised several critical issues that significantly affect the paper's suitability for publication in a top-tier conference.\n\n### Detailed Reasoning:\n\n1. **Novelty and Contribution**:\n   - The paper claims to address a gap in existing multi-task learning frameworks by modeling task dependencies. However, multiple reviewers pointed out that the idea of modeling task relationships is not new and has been explored in prior works, particularly referencing the \"Taskonomy\" paper. The lack of adequate discussion and comparison with this prior work undermines the novelty of the proposed approach.\n   - The reviewers also noted that the distinction between \"general task dependency\" and \"data dependency\" is not clearly articulated, which raises questions about the significance of the proposed contributions.\n\n2. **Methodological Clarity**:\n   - Several reviewers highlighted that the methodology lacks clarity and detail. For instance, the presentation of the \"Transfer Block\" and the \"Point-wise Mutual Attention Mechanism\" is insufficiently detailed, making it difficult to assess the technical correctness of the proposed methods.\n   - There are also issues with notation and terminology that lead to confusion, such as the inconsistent use of indices and the unclear definitions of terms like \"multi-view task dependency\" versus \"multi-level task dependency.\"\n\n3. **Experimental Validation**:\n   - The experimental section is criticized for not being thorough enough. Reviewers suggested that the authors should include additional baselines and comparisons to existing methods to validate the effectiveness of their approach. The absence of such comparisons raises concerns about the robustness of the claims made regarding performance improvements.\n   - There are also questions about the evaluation methodology, particularly regarding the potential overlap of training and test data in multi-label settings, which could compromise the validity of the results.\n\n4. **Presentation and Grammar**:\n   - The paper suffers from numerous grammatical errors and poor presentation, making it difficult to follow the arguments and technical details. This is a significant concern for a submission to a prestigious conference, where clarity and professionalism in writing are expected.\n\n5. **Rebuttal and Author Responses**:\n   - While the authors provided a rebuttal that addressed some of the reviewers' comments, it did not sufficiently resolve the major issues raised. The need for a clearer discussion of how the proposed method differs from and improves upon existing works remains unaddressed.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the significant concerns regarding novelty, methodological clarity, experimental validation, and overall presentation, the paper does not meet the standards expected for publication in a top-tier conference. The reviewers' feedback indicates that substantial revisions are necessary to address these issues, and the current version is not ready for acceptance.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

      "response": "The paper titled \"GG-GAN: A Geometric Graph Generative Adversarial Network\" presents a novel approach to graph generation using a Wasserstein GAN framework. The authors claim that their method addresses key challenges in graph generation, such as modeling complex relations, ensuring isomorphic graphs are treated consistently, and fully exploiting latent distributions. The reviewers provided a range of comments, highlighting both strengths and weaknesses of the paper.\n\n### Strengths:\n1. **Novelty and Theoretical Support**: The paper introduces a new generative model for graphs that is theoretically supported by several theorems. Reviewers noted that the approach is innovative and has potential applications in generating geometric graphs.\n2. **Clarity and Organization**: The paper is generally well-written and organized, making it accessible to readers. This is an important aspect for publication in a top-tier conference.\n3. **Desirable Properties**: The proposed GG-GAN is permutation equivariant and scalable, which are significant advantages for generating large graphs.\n\n### Weaknesses:\n1. **Limited Experimental Validation**: Several reviewers pointed out that the experimental results are not convincing. The datasets used are small (graphs with up to 20 vertices), which limits the generalizability of the findings. The presence of many isomorphic graphs in the datasets could skew the results, and the authors did not provide sufficient evidence of performance on larger graphs.\n2. **Comparison with Baselines**: The paper lacks comprehensive comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, particularly with models like NetGAN and TagGen, which are known for their performance in graph generation. Reviewers noted that the results presented do not convincingly demonstrate that GG-GAN outperforms existing methods.\n3. **Theoretical Claims and Assumptions**: Some theoretical claims made in the paper were questioned by reviewers. For instance, the independence assumption in Proposition 1 and the sampling mechanism for edges were seen as potentially weak. Additionally, the necessity of certain mechanisms, such as avoiding collisions, was not well justified.\n4. **Mode Collapse and Generation Diversity**: Reviewer 2 raised concerns about the potential for mode collapse in the proposed model, which is a common issue in GANs. The authors did not adequately address this concern in their paper.\n5. **Literature Review**: The literature review was deemed insufficient, lacking a thorough discussion of how GG-GAN relates to existing work in graph generation. This is critical for situating the contribution within the broader research landscape.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile the paper presents an interesting approach to graph generation and has some theoretical backing, the weaknesses in experimental validation, lack of comprehensive comparisons with existing methods, and insufficient addressing of theoretical claims and concerns about mode collapse are significant drawbacks. The reviewers' consensus leans towards a weak rejection, primarily due to the limited experimental evidence and the need for a more robust theoretical foundation.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

The reviewers provided a range of comments, highlighting both strengths and weaknesses of the paper.\n\n### Strengths:\n1. **Theoretical Contribution**: The paper provides a rigorous theoretical framework for understanding the convergence of the FA algorithm in deep linear networks. This is a significant contribution, as it extends the existing literature on optimization in neural networks.\n2. **Interesting Observations**: The identification of implicit anti-regularization and the conditions under which it occurs is a novel finding that could have implications for understanding learning dynamics in neural networks.\n3. **Clarity and Structure**: Reviewers noted that the paper is well-written and clearly structured, making it accessible to readers.\n\n### Weaknesses:\n1. **Oversimplification**: Several reviewers expressed concerns that the analysis relies on a one-dimensional simplification that may not capture the complexities of high-dimensional dynamics in deep networks. This raises questions about the generalizability of the results.\n2. **Initialization Assumptions**: The reliance on specific initialization schemes (spectral initialization) limits the applicability of the findings. Reviewers pointed out that such initializations are not commonly used in practice, and the lack of empirical validation under more typical initialization methods weakens the paper's impact.\n3. **Limited Empirical Evidence**: While the theoretical results are interesting, the empirical validation is minimal. Reviewers suggested that additional experiments under various initialization schemes would strengthen the paper's claims and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the phenomena observed.\n\n### Reviewer Consensus:\n- Reviewers 1 and 2 were skeptical about the significance of the contributions, suggesting that the results may not be sufficiently novel or impactful. They highlighted the need for broader applicability beyond the specific settings analyzed.\n- Reviewer 3 found the paper to be a valuable contribution, emphasizing its relevance to the community and the interesting findings regarding implicit bias.\n- Reviewer 4 raised significant concerns about the practical relevance of the results, emphasizing the need for connections to commonly used initialization schemes and suggesting that the findings may not hold in more general settings.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe paper presents a solid theoretical analysis with interesting findings, but it is hampered by its reliance on specific assumptions that limit its applicability. The concerns raised by multiple reviewers regarding the oversimplification of the problem and the lack of empirical validation under typical conditions are significant. While the theoretical contributions are noteworthy, the practical implications remain unclear without further empirical support.\n\nGiven these considerations, the paper does not meet the standards expected for acceptance at a top-tier conference, where both theoretical rigor and practical relevance are crucial.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

The authors derive a randomization mechanism that is optimal under a given regression loss function and provide empirical evaluations demonstrating the efficacy of their method compared to existing DP techniques.\n\n### Strengths:\n1. **Novelty and Contribution**: The paper introduces a new mechanism for label DP that is claimed to be optimal for regression tasks. This is a significant contribution, especially as it extends the concept of label DP from classification to regression, which has not been extensively explored in prior work.\n2. **Empirical Evaluation**: The authors conduct thorough experiments on real-world datasets, showing that their proposed method outperforms traditional DP methods like Laplace and Exponential mechanisms. This empirical validation strengthens the paper's claims.\n3. **Clarity**: Reviewers noted that the paper is well-written and easy to follow, which is crucial for dissemination in a top-tier conference.\n\n### Weaknesses:\n1. **Comparison with Prior Work**: Several reviewers pointed out that the paper does not adequately compare its method with other existing label-DP methods, particularly the work by Ghazi et al. (2021). This lack of comparison may undermine the perceived novelty and significance of the contributions.\n2. **Technical Novelty**: While the paper presents a new mechanism, some reviewers argue that the contributions are only marginally significant or novel compared to existing work. This is a critical point, as top-tier conferences typically seek groundbreaking contributions.\n3. **Minor Issues**: Some reviewers noted minor correctness issues and suggested that certain claims require better support or clarification. While these are not deal-breakers, they indicate that the paper could benefit from further refinement.\n\n### Reviewer Consensus:\nThe reviews are mixed, with some reviewers expressing strong support for the paper's contributions and others questioning its novelty and significance. The concerns about the lack of comparison with prior work and the marginal novelty are particularly important, as they could affect the paper's standing in a competitive conference environment.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the strengths of the paper, particularly its novel approach and empirical validation, it has potential value for the community. However, the concerns regarding the lack of comprehensive comparisons with existing methods and the questions about the novelty of the contributions weigh heavily against it. For a top-tier conference, the paper would need to address these issues more robustly.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

The authors introduce the Differentiable Diffusion Sampler Search (DDSS) and the Generalized Gaussian Diffusion Models (GGDM), which aim to reduce the number of inference steps required while maintaining or improving sample quality.\n\n#### Strengths:\n1. **Novelty and Relevance**: The problem addressed is significant in the field of generative models, particularly in the context of diffusion models, which are known for their high sample quality but computational inefficiency. The proposed methods could potentially lead to advancements in this area.\n2. **Empirical Results**: The paper reports strong empirical results, demonstrating improved FID scores with fewer sampling steps compared to existing methods. This is a compelling contribution that could have practical implications for the deployment of diffusion models.\n3. **Technical Contributions**: The introduction of a new family of samplers (GGDM) and the optimization procedure (DDSS) are noteworthy contributions that could inspire further research.\n\n#### Weaknesses:\n1. **Theoretical Justification**: Several reviewers pointed out the lack of theoretical insights into the proposed methods. The optimization objective based on perceptual loss raises questions about the underlying statistical properties of the generated samples. The paper does not provide sufficient theoretical guarantees or proofs, which is a significant concern for a top-tier conference.\n2. **Clarity and Presentation**: Multiple reviewers noted issues with clarity in the presentation of the methods and results. The notation and explanations could be confusing, which detracts from the overall understanding of the contributions. Clearer definitions and a more structured presentation would enhance the paper's readability.\n3. **Limited Experimental Validation**: While the empirical results are promising, the experiments are primarily conducted on smaller datasets (CIFAR-10 and ImageNet 64x64). Reviewers suggested that testing on larger datasets (e.g., LSUN, CelebA) would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the method's effectiveness and robustness.\n4. **Concerns About Overfitting**: Some reviewers expressed concerns that optimizing the perceptual loss might lead to overfitting to the evaluation metrics (FID/IS scores), which could undermine the generalizability of the results.\n\n#### Reviewer Feedback:\n- Reviewer 1 raised important questions about the significance of the improvements and the need for further analysis to clarify the contributions.\n- Reviewer 2 acknowledged the empirical improvements but highlighted the need for better motivation and justification for the proposed methods.\n- Reviewer 3 found the results compelling but noted that the GGDP's utility might be primarily as a facilitator for the DDSS optimization rather than as a standalone improvement.\n- Reviewer 4 pointed out the lack of theoretical guarantees and the need for more extensive experimental validation.\n- Reviewer 5 emphasized clarity issues and suggested that the paper could benefit from better organization and explanation of the methods.\n\n### Conclusion\nWhile the paper presents a relevant and potentially impactful contribution to the field of generative models, the concerns regarding theoretical justification, clarity, and experimental validation are significant. The lack of a strong theoretical foundation and the need for clearer presentation may hinder its acceptance at a top-tier conference. Given these considerations, I recommend rejecting the paper, with the suggestion that the authors address the highlighted weaknesses and resubmit in the future.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

The authors claim that placing BN after bounded activation functions leads to better performance due to the effects of asymmetric saturation and increased sparsity.\n\n### Strengths:\n1. **Novelty of Observation**: The paper identifies a counterintuitive result that the order of BN and activation functions can significantly affect performance, particularly with bounded activations. This is a relevant topic in deep learning, as both BN and activation functions are fundamental components of neural networks.\n2. **Empirical Analysis**: The authors conducted extensive experiments across various architectures and activation functions, providing a solid empirical foundation for their claims.\n3. **Clear Logic Chain**: The paper presents a logical progression from observation to analysis, detailing how the swap order affects saturation and sparsity.\n\n### Weaknesses:\n1. **Lack of Rigorous Support for Claims**: Multiple reviewers pointed out that several claims made in the paper are not well-supported or are misleading. For example, the relationship between asymmetric saturation and generalization performance is not convincingly established. The authors need to provide clearer evidence and more rigorous analysis to support their conclusions.\n2. **Limited Generalizability**: The analysis is primarily focused on bounded activation functions and does not adequately address how these findings might apply to other widely used activation functions like ReLU. The paper's conclusions may not be broadly applicable to many practical scenarios in deep learning.\n3. **Confusion in Metrics and Definitions**: Reviewers noted that some terms and metrics used in the paper, such as \"center of the function\" and \"saturation,\" are not clearly defined. This lack of clarity can lead to misunderstandings and diminishes the overall quality of the paper.\n4. **Inconsistencies in Results**: There are inconsistencies in the experimental results, particularly regarding the saturation and sparsity metrics across different layers. This raises questions about the robustness of the findings and the conclusions drawn from them.\n\n### Reviewer Concerns:\n- Several reviewers expressed doubts about the connection between saturation, sparsity, and generalization performance, suggesting that the authors need to clarify these relationships.\n- The paper does not convincingly demonstrate that the Swap model outperforms the Convention model in a practical sense, especially when compared to the performance of models using ReLU.\n- The experimental setup and analysis could be improved, particularly regarding the impact of hyperparameters and the applicability of the findings to different architectures.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile the paper presents an interesting observation and contributes to the understanding of BN and activation functions, the weaknesses identified—particularly the lack of rigorous support for claims, limited generalizability, and confusion in definitions—significantly undermine its impact.

The authors claim that their method, which applies more regularization to vulnerable data, is theoretically motivated and empirically superior to existing algorithms.\n\n### Detailed Reasoning\n\n1. **Theoretical Contributions**: \n   - The reviewers have raised significant concerns regarding the theoretical contributions of the paper, particularly the validity and novelty of Theorem 1. Several reviewers argue that the theorem essentially restates existing results from TRADES, particularly for binary classification, and that the extension to multi-class classification does not provide substantial new insights. The lack of rigor in the mathematical definitions and the perceived looseness of the bounds presented in the theorem have led to skepticism about the theoretical foundation of the proposed method.\n   - Reviewers 5, 9, 10, and 16 explicitly state that the theoretical contributions are either marginal or meaningless, which is a critical issue for a top-tier conference where theoretical rigor is paramount.\n\n2. **Empirical Evaluation**:\n   - The empirical results show that the proposed method achieves improvements over existing methods, but many reviewers note that these improvements are marginal. Reviewers 8, 15, and 16 highlight that the results are not convincingly superior to existing methods like HAT and TRADES, especially when considering the use of additional data.\n   - The experiments are conducted on relatively small datasets (CIFAR-10, F-MNIST, SVHN), and there are calls for validation on larger datasets to establish the robustness of the findings. The lack of substantial empirical novelty and the small improvements reported weaken the case for acceptance.\n\n3. **Clarity and Quality**:\n   - The paper is generally well-written and clear, which is a positive aspect. However, the clarity of the theoretical contributions is undermined by the reviewers' concerns about the rigor of the mathematical statements. The reviewers have pointed out that the definitions and mathematical formulations need to be more precise, which is essential for the audience of a top-tier conference.\n\n4. **Reviewer Consensus**:\n   - There is a notable division among the reviewers. While some express a willingness to accept the paper based on its empirical results and theoretical motivation, a significant number of reviewers are critical of both the theoretical and empirical contributions. The concerns raised about the theoretical claims being overreaching and the empirical results being marginal are serious enough to warrant rejection.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment**:\n   - Given the critical feedback regarding the theoretical contributions, the marginal empirical improvements, and the need for more robust experimental validation, the paper does not meet the high standards expected for acceptance at a top-tier conference. The issues raised by multiple reviewers indicate that the paper lacks sufficient novelty and rigor in both theory and practice.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"
