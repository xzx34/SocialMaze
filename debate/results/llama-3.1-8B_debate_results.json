The authors claim that their regularizers result in tighter certification bounds than non-regularized baselines. To evaluate the paper, I will consider the following aspects:\n\n1. **Originality and Contribution**: The paper builds upon existing work on convex relaxations and certified robustness.

The authors aim to improve the scalability of softmax regression by introducing an adversarial sampling mechanism to generate negative samples. This approach is motivated by the need to reduce the gradient cost, which is typically proportional to the number of classes (C), making traditional softmax regression computationally expensive.\n\nThe paper makes three key contributions:\n\n1. **Adversarial sampling mechanism**: The authors propose a method to generate negative samples using an adversarial model that mimics the data distribution. This approach is claimed to produce negative samples at a cost only logarithmic in C, making it computationally efficient.\n2. **Mathematical proof**: The authors provide a mathematical proof that their adversarial sampling mechanism minimizes the gradient variance while removing any bias due to non-uniform sampling.\n3. **Experimental results**: The paper presents experimental results on large-scale datasets, demonstrating a significant reduction in training time (by an order of magnitude) compared to several competitive baselines.\n\n**Strengths**\n\n* The paper addresses a significant problem in machine learning, extreme classification, and proposes a novel solution.\n* The authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their approach, making it easy to understand.\n* The mathematical proof is a strong contribution, as it provides a theoretical foundation for the proposed method.\n* The experimental results are impressive, demonstrating a significant improvement over existing methods.\n\n**Weaknesses**\n\n* The paper assumes a certain level of background knowledge in machine learning and extreme classification, which may make it challenging for non-experts to follow.\n* The adversarial sampling mechanism is not fully explained, and more details about the architecture and training of the adversarial model would be beneficial.\n* The paper does not provide a thorough comparison with other state-of-the-art methods, which may limit its impact.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOverall, the paper presents a novel and promising approach to extreme classification, with a clear and concise explanation of the method and impressive experimental results.

      "response": "**Detailed Reasoning**\n\nThe paper presents a novel approach to the ecological inference problem, which is a significant contribution to the field of machine learning and statistics. The authors propose an efficient approximation to the loss function for ecological inference, allowing them to construct ecological versions of various machine learning models, including deep neural networks and Bayesian neural networks.\n\nThe paper's methodology is well-defined, and the authors provide a clear explanation of their approach. They demonstrate the effectiveness of their method on a real-world dataset from the Maryland 2018 midterm elections, showing that increased network depth and joint learning of multiple races within an election improve the accuracy of ecological inference.\n\nThe results presented in the paper are impressive, with the authors achieving state-of-the-art performance on the benchmark data from polling. Additionally, they leverage data on the joint distribution of ballots to show that joint learning leads to significantly improved recovery of the covariance structure for multi-task ecological inference.\n\nOne of the strengths of the paper is its ability to learn latent representations of voters, which outperform raw covariates for leave-one-out prediction. This is a significant contribution, as it suggests that the authors' approach can uncover underlying patterns in the data that are not apparent from traditional covariates.\n\nHowever, there are a few areas where the paper could be improved. Firstly, the authors could provide more detailed explanations of their approximation to the loss function and how it relates to existing work in the field. Additionally, while the results are impressive, the authors could provide more robustness checks and sensitivity analyses to ensure that their findings are not due to overfitting or other methodological issues.\n\nFinally, the paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the implications of their results for real-world applications. While the authors mention the potential for their approach to be used in election administration, they could provide more concrete examples and discuss the potential limitations and challenges of their method in practice.\n\n**Final Decision: Accept**\n\nWhile the paper has some areas for improvement, the authors' novel approach to ecological inference, impressive results, and clear methodology make it a strong candidate for publication at a top-tier conference. With some revisions to address the areas mentioned above, the paper has the potential to make a significant impact in the field and contribute to ongoing research in machine learning and statistics."

The authors claim that their algorithm can significantly reduce the number of neurons in a trained network with minimal impact on the learned function and accuracy.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n1. **Theoretical foundation**: The paper builds upon recent theoretical work on regularization in deep ReLU networks, which is a significant strength. This foundation provides a solid basis for the proposed algorithm.\n2. **Novel contribution**: The reduction algorithm itself appears to be a novel contribution, as it leverages the properties of ReLU neurons to achieve compression.\n3. **Experimental evaluation**: The authors provide two experiments to demonstrate the efficacy of the algorithm, which is essential for assessing the practical impact of the proposed method.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n1. **Lack of clarity in algorithm description**: The abstract and paper title suggest that the algorithm is based on the theory of regularization, but the actual description of the algorithm is not provided in the abstract. This lack of clarity may indicate that the algorithm is not well-defined or that the authors are not providing sufficient information for the reader to understand the method.\n2. **Limited experimental evaluation**: While the authors provide two experiments, the scope of these experiments is limited.

The abstract mentions \"provably almost no change of the learned function,\" but this claim requires more detailed explanation and justification.\n2. **Practical implications**: The paper focuses on the theoretical aspects of the algorithm, but it is unclear whether the authors have considered the practical implications of applying this algorithm to real-world problems. For example, how does the algorithm handle non-convex optimization problems, and what are the computational costs associated with the algorithm?\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWhile the paper has some strengths, including its theoretical foundation and novel contribution, it also has significant weaknesses and concerns. The lack of clarity in algorithm description, limited experimental evaluation, and omission of comparisons to existing methods are major concerns. Additionally, the paper's focus on theoretical aspects without sufficient consideration of practical implications raises questions about the algorithm's applicability and effectiveness.\n\n**Final Decision: Reject**\n\nThe paper requires significant revisions to address the concerns mentioned above. The authors should provide a clear and detailed description of the algorithm, expand the experimental evaluation to include a more diverse set of tasks and datasets, and compare the proposed algorithm to existing methods for neural network compression.

The authors claim that this swapped order achieves better performance on various benchmarks and architectures compared to the conventional order, where BN is applied before activation functions.
