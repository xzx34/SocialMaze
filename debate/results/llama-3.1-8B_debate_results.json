The paper provides a theoretical analysis of the convergence of stochastic gradient descent-ascent for Wasserstein GANs with a one-layer generator network and simple discriminators.\n2. The authors show that the generator can learn the marginal distribution with a linear discriminator and the joint distribution with a quadratic discriminator.\n3. The paper provides sample complexity results and experiments to justify the theory.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n1. The discriminators used in the paper are too simple to approximate the Wasserstein distance, which is a major concern raised by all reviewers.\n2. The analysis is limited to one-layer generator networks and simple discriminators, which makes it difficult to extend the results to more complex settings.\n3. The claim that SGD learns one-layer networks can be misleading, as pointed out by Reviewer 2.\n4. The paper does not consider the standard two-layer network discriminator, which is a major drawback mentioned by Reviewer 1 and Reviewer 3.\n\n**Author responses:**\n\nThe authors have responded to the reviewer comments, but their responses do not fully address the concerns raised by the reviewers. Specifically, they do not provide a clear explanation of how the quadratic discriminator can be treated as a WGAN, and they do not provide a convincing argument for why they did not consider the standard two-layer network discriminator.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWhile the paper provides some interesting theoretical results, its limitations and weaknesses outweigh its strengths. The use of simple discriminators and one-layer generator networks makes the analysis too simplistic and difficult to extend to more complex settings. The claim that SGD learns one-layer networks is also misleading. Therefore, I recommend rejecting the paper for publication at a top-tier conference.\n\n**Final Decision: Reject**"

This is a significant contribution to the field of deep learning and approximation theory.\n2. **Technical soundness**: The paper's technical approach, based on eigenvalue analysis of dynamical systems associated with periodic functions, is sound and well-executed.

The exposition is clear and well-written, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments.\n4. **Reviewer feedback**: The authors have responded thoughtfully to Reviewer 1's and Reviewer 2's comments, addressing their concerns and providing additional insights. Reviewer 2's feedback is particularly positive, highlighting the paper's strengths and suggesting acceptance.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n1. **Structure and organization**: Reviewer 3's comment suggests that the paper's structure could be improved by presenting the main result (Theorem 4.1) earlier and providing more context for the theoretical background. While this is a valid criticism, it does not detract from the paper's overall quality.\n2. **Practical implications**: Reviewer 3 also notes that the period-dependent depth lower bound may not be directly useful for practical applications, as assessing or bounding the period of a classification task can be challenging. However, this is a common issue in theoretical work, and the paper's contributions to our understanding of DNNs' expressive power are still valuable.\n\nConsidering these strengths and weaknesses, I believe that the paper's originality, technical soundness, and significance outweigh its minor structural and practical limitations.

The paper provides qualitative and quantitative results that demonstrate the effectiveness of ROOTS in decomposing 3D scenes into individual objects.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n1. The paper is poorly written, with numerous grammatical errors, typos, and unclear notation.\n2. The authors make unsubstantiated claims, such as being the \"first unsupervised model that can identify objects in a 3D scene,\" which is not true.\n3. The paper lacks proper citations, comparisons with the latest works, and ablation studies to investigate the contributions of each component.\n4. The experiments are weak, with small differences between ROOTS and GQN, and the paper fails to demonstrate the importance of the object-oriented representation.\n5. The paper ignores a great deal of work in the vision community on 3D representation learning, object detection, and scene understanding.\n\n**Reviewer comments:**\n\nAll reviewers agree that the paper is interesting but has significant issues with writing, clarity, and experimental design. Reviewer 1 suggests that the paper should be rejected due to poor writing, while Reviewer 2 recommends rejection due to weak experiments and lack of clarity. Reviewer 3 suggests that the paper lacks maturity and requires further revisions. Reviewer 4 leans towards rejection due to complexity, poor explanation, and weak experiments.\n\n**Author responses:**\n\nThe authors have made some revisions to address the reviewer comments, but the changes are not sufficient to address the major concerns.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, I conclude that the paper should be **Rejected** for publication at a top-tier conference. While the paper presents an interesting approach to 3D scene representation learning, the significant issues with writing, clarity, and experimental design outweigh the contributions of the paper. The authors need to revise the paper extensively to address the major concerns and provide a more robust and well-written submission.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

The comparison method is not properly set, as pointed out by Reviewer 1. The authors compare their method with the vanilla version of the Mahalanobis detector, which requires validation to determine weights for feature ensembling, but the validation can be done without OOD data by generating adversarial samples.\n2. The performance of the replication of the prior method is far lower than reported, which raises concerns about the accuracy of the results.\n3. The paper lacks a clear justification for the strict constraints imposed on the problem, as pointed out by Reviewer 2. The authors should provide more context on why these constraints are necessary and whether they are realistic in real-world applications.\n4. The paper could benefit from additional proofreading, as mentioned by Reviewer 2.\n5.

      "response": "After carefully analyzing the paper and the reviewer comments, I have the following detailed reasoning:\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n1. The paper proposes a novel exploration method, Deep Coherent Exploration, which unifies step-based and trajectory-based exploration for deep reinforcement learning algorithms on continuous control tasks.\n2. The method is mathematically sound and scalable to deep RL methods, making it a valuable contribution to the field.\n3. The empirical results for on-policy methods (A2C and PPO) are strong and demonstrate the value of this approach.\n4. The authors provide detailed mathematical derivations and recipes for incorporating the method into on-policy and off-policy methods.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n1. The off-policy case (SAC) is not as strong as the on-policy case, and the experimental results are not as convincing.\n2. The method is not much different from the prior work by van Hoof et al. (2017), and the authors do not explicitly address this limitation.\n3. The experiments are limited to a single domain (Mujoco) and do not provide a comprehensive evaluation of the method's performance.\n4. The paper focuses on exploration, but the experiments only focus on return performance, and additional experiments on pure exploration or sparse-rewarded tasks are needed.\n\n**Reviewer comments:**\n\n1. Reviewer 1 is generally positive about the paper and suggests reframing the off-policy case as a limitation.\n2. Reviewer 2 is more critical and points out that the method is not novel in the literature of undirected exploration and that the significance of the proposed approach in practice might be limited.\n3. Reviewer 3 is positive about the paper's contribution in scalability and evaluation on standard benchmarks, but suggests moving some technical details to the appendix.\n4. Reviewer 4 is also critical and points out that the idea of the paper directly follows GE (van Hoof et al., 2017) and that the method is not much effective for SAC.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the strengths and weaknesses of the paper, as well as the reviewer comments, I conclude that the paper has some valuable contributions to the field of reinforcement learning, particularly in the area of exploration. However, the paper also has some limitations, such as the off-policy case not being as strong as the on-policy case, and the experiments being limited to a single domain.\n\nConsidering the reviewer comments and the paper's limitations, I would recommend **Acceptance** with some minor revisions to address the concerns raised by the reviewers. Specifically, the authors should:\n\n1. Reframe the off-policy case as a limitation and explicitly address it.\n2. Provide additional experiments on pure exploration or sparse-rewarded tasks.\n3. Move some technical details to the appendix to improve the paper's clarity.\n4. Provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the method's performance on multiple domains.\n\nFinal Decision: Accept"

Reviewer 5 has provided a detailed critique of the paper, highlighting several areas for improvement, including the discussion of related work, the experimental design, and the clarity of the writing.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of the paper and the reviewer comments, I conclude that the paper has several weaknesses that need to be addressed before it can be considered for publication. While the paper presents a novel approach to planning in large state spaces, the technical contribution is not as significant as the authors claim, and the paper lacks a thorough discussion of related work. Additionally, several unclear or missing details need to be addressed, and the analysis of the bias-variance tradeoff is lacking. Therefore, I recommend that the paper be **Rejected** for publication in its current form.\n\nHowever, I would like to suggest that the authors revise the paper to address the concerns raised by the reviewers and provide a more thorough discussion of related work, a clearer explanation of the technical contribution, and a more detailed analysis of the bias-variance tradeoff. With these revisions, the paper may be considered for publication in a future iteration."

The paper also explores the role of gradient descent in controlling the margin of the returned network from the solution space, which is a novel and interesting aspect.\n\nHowever, the paper has several limitations and concerns raised by the reviewers. Reviewer 1 and Reviewer 2 point out that the experiments show loose bounds and lack practical significance, and that the section on margin is simplistic and not well-supported. Reviewer 3 and Reviewer 5 also express concerns about the paper's premature nature, lack of comprehensive experiments, and limited experimental evidence. Reviewer 6 and Reviewer 7 highlight the importance of comparing different architectures and explicit comparison to prior works, as well as the need for more rigorous analysis of the implicit bias of gradient descent.\n\nReviewer 8 raises concerns about the PAC-Bayes bound being incremental and not directly upper bounding the generalization error of a given neural network with null training error. Reviewer 9 points out that the claim that the bound can accurately reflect the influence of architectures is limited to MLPs of different depths and does not apply to other architectures like CNNs or ResNets.\n\nConsidering these concerns and limitations, I believe that the paper has some interesting ideas and contributions, but it is not yet ready for publication in a top-tier conference.

The authors need to provide a more detailed justification for this assumption.\n3. **Empirical novelty and significance**: The paper presents some empirical results, but Reviewer 7 and Reviewer 9 express concerns about the quality and relevance of these results. The experiments are conducted on relatively simple environments, and the figures are not well-motivated.\n4. **Connection to deep RL**: Reviewer 7 and Reviewer 9 question the connection between the paper's results and deep reinforcement learning. While the paper claims to provide insights into the behavior of deep models, the reviewers argue that the results are not directly applicable to deep RL.\n5. **Writing and presentation**: Reviewer 9 points out several grammatical errors and suggests that the paper needs to be proofread.\n\nConsidering these points, I believe that the paper has some technical merit, but it falls short in terms of novelty, significance, and empirical relevance. The authors need to address the concerns raised by the reviewers and provide a more rigorous and well-motivated analysis.\n\n**Final Decision: Reject**\n\nThe paper has some technical merit, but it requires significant revisions to address the concerns raised by the reviewers. The authors need to provide a more detailed justification for their mathematical assumptions, improve the empirical results, and clarify the connection to deep RL."

Reviewer 1 suggests that the authors could have explored the implications of their theory more deeply, such as investigating the behavior of their analytical theory when features of more than two scales are present.\n2. Reviewer 2 points out that the implicit regularization effects of SGD/GD on least square linear regression may perform as a Ridge regularization, which could lead to similar double descent behavior. The authors should discuss the connections between their work and existing literature on Ridge-style implicit regularization.\n3. Reviewer 3 notes that the paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the prior results used for the analytic calculation and a clearer explanation of how the student-teacher model relates to realistic settings.\n4.

While the idea of combining these techniques is interesting, the execution and presentation of the paper are not sufficient to justify its novelty.\n2. **Limited evaluation**: The paper's evaluation is limited to a single domain (SameGame) and does not compare to a wide range of existing methods, including online RL methods, offline RL methods, and other MCTS-based methods. This makes it difficult to assess the paper's claims and contributions.\n3. **Poor presentation**: Reviewer 1 and Reviewer 3 mention that the paper's writing and presentation are unclear, with some sections requiring multiple passes to understand. This is a significant concern, as a top-tier conference expects papers to be well-written and easy to follow.\n4. **Minor issues**: Reviewer 2 and Reviewer 3 mention several minor issues, including typos, grammar errors, and unclear definitions. While these are not major concerns, they do detract from the paper's overall quality and professionalism.\n5. **Lack of comparison to AlphaZero**: Reviewer 2 and Reviewer 3 mention that the paper does not compare to AlphaZero, which is a well-known and influential method in the field. This omission is a significant weakness, as AlphaZero is a natural comparison for any MCTS-based method.\n\nConsidering these concerns, I believe that the paper has significant weaknesses that need to be addressed before it can be considered for publication in a top-tier conference. While the idea of combining MCTS and Transformers is interesting, the paper's execution and presentation are not sufficient to justify its publication.\n\n**Final Decision: Reject**"

The paper proposes a novel generative model, Variational Neural Cellular Automata (VNCA), which is loosely inspired by biological processes of cellular growth and differentiation.\n2. The VNCA is a proper probabilistic generative model, and the authors evaluate it according to best practices.\n3. The paper provides qualitative analysis of the self-organized generation process and shows robustness to early-stage perturbations of latents.\n4. The authors have addressed most of the reviewer comments and concerns in their rebuttal.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n1. The experimental results are underwhelming, with the VNCA performing significantly behind the state-of-the-art in terms of generative modeling performance.\n2. The paper lacks a clear motivation for the VNCA, and it is not entirely clear what problem of prior work it is solving.\n3. Some reviewers have pointed out that the VNCA is not novel in terms of architecture, and that many deep convolutional networks with repeating blocks can be interpreted as NCAs.\n4. The paper does not provide a clear explanation of the relationship between NCA and weight-shared ResNets.\n\n**Reviewer comments:**\n\n1. Reviewer 1 is leaning towards rejection due to underwhelming experimental results.\n2. Reviewer 2 suggests that the paper is not novel in terms of architecture, but that it is still valuable for bridging the literature between ResNets and NCA.\n3. Reviewer 3 has raised their score to a full \"accept\" after the rebuttal.\n4. Reviewer 4 is leaning towards rejection due to underwhelming experimental results, but acknowledges that the paper is well-written and provides interesting analysis.\n5. Reviewer 5 has raised their score to \"8: accept, good paper\" after the rebuttal.\n6.

While the VNCA is a novel generative model, the experimental results are underwhelming, and the paper lacks a clear motivation. Additionally, some reviewers have pointed out that the VNCA is not novel in terms of architecture.\n\nHowever, the authors have addressed most of the reviewer comments and concerns in their rebuttal, and the paper provides interesting analysis of the self-organized generation process.

The authors should provide a clear explanation of the relationship between NCA and weight-shared ResNets.\n3. The authors should provide more experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the VNCA.\n\nFinal Decision: Accept"

However, several reviewers have raised concerns about the theoretical contributions of the paper. Reviewer 5, 9, and 16 argue that Theorem 1 is not a new contribution, but rather a simple extension of the existing bound in TRADES.

The paper's clarity and reproducibility have been called into question by some reviewers, who have pointed out issues with the presentation of results and the availability of code and data.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nBased on the strengths and weaknesses of the paper, as well as the concerns raised by the reviewers, I recommend that the paper be **Rejected** for publication at this time. While the paper proposes a novel extension of DeepProbLog and demonstrates some promising results, the lack of extensive empirical evaluation, the limited scope of the experimental evaluation, and the concerns about clarity and reproducibility are significant concerns that need to be addressed before the paper can be considered for publication.\n\nHowever, I would suggest that the authors revise the paper to address these concerns, including:\n\n1. Providing more comprehensive empirical evaluations on a wider range of benchmarks.\n2. Discussing the performance-efficiency tradeoff in more detail, particularly in the context of weighted model integration solvers.\n3. Clarifying the novelty and significance of the paper's contributions.\n4. Improving the paper's organization and presentation, including the relegation of key contributions to the appendix.\n\nIf the authors can address these concerns and revise the paper accordingly, it may be considered for publication at a later time."

      "response": "After carefully analyzing the paper, reviewer comments, and author responses, I have the following detailed reasoning:\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n1. The paper presents a novel dataset, RuDar, which is a significant contribution to the field of precipitation nowcasting. The dataset is rich, containing information at several altitude levels, during 2 years, and with additional fields that are not always present in such datasets.\n2. The paper provides a thorough evaluation of several baselines, including optical flow and neural network models, on the proposed dataset.\n3. The authors have made the dataset and code publicly available, which is a significant contribution to the community.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n1. The paper lacks methodological novelties. The authors have not introduced any new techniques or architectures for precipitation nowcasting.\n2. The baseline methods used in the paper are relatively simple and lack ablation study experiments.\n3. The evaluation metric used in the paper is limited to MSE, which may not fully capture the accuracy of nowcasting.\n4. The paper does not provide a clear comparison with other datasets, which makes it difficult to assess the novelty and significance of the RuDar dataset.\n5. The authors' claim that the dataset can be applied to other ML tasks, such as data shift studying, anomaly detection, or uncertainty estimation, is not fully explored in the paper.\n\n**Reviewer Comments:**\n\n1. Reviewer 1 suggests that the paper is good but lacks novelty and significance. They also question the usability of the dataset and the comparability of the models trained on this dataset with advanced weather forecasting devices.\n2. Reviewer 2 suggests that the paper is well-written and clear, but lacks more ablation study experiments and a clear comparison with other datasets. They also question the simplicity of the baseline methods and the evaluation metric used.\n3. Reviewer 3 suggests that the paper is very clear and presents an interesting database and benchmark of different precipitation forecasting databases and deep learning forecast estimation models. However, they do not think it is enough for an ICLR publication due to the lack of novelty and significance.\n\n**Author Responses:**\n\nThe authors have responded to the reviewer comments by addressing some of the concerns, such as the simplicity of the baseline methods and the evaluation metric used. However, they have not fully addressed the concerns regarding the novelty and significance of the RuDar dataset.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, I conclude that the paper has some strengths, such as the novel dataset and thorough evaluation of baselines. However, the paper lacks methodological novelties, and the baseline methods used are relatively simple. The evaluation metric used is limited, and the paper does not provide a clear comparison with other datasets. While the authors have made the dataset and code publicly available, which is a significant contribution to the community, I do not think that this paper is suitable for publication in a top-tier conference like ICLR.\n\n**Final Decision: Reject**"

      "response": "After carefully analyzing the paper and the reviewer comments, I have the following detailed reasoning:\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n1. The paper addresses an important and challenging problem in game theory and machine learning, which is the convergence of no-regret learning dynamics to good equilibria.\n2. The authors provide a systematic comparison of different optimal learning dynamics in a class of games with severe equilibrium selection problems.\n3. The paper combines tools from machine learning, game theory, and dynamical systems, which is a unique and interesting aspect of the work.\n4. The authors provide an exhaustive comparison between gradient descent and \"standard\" replicator in a class of games with severe equilibrium selection problems.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n1. The paper's main results are limited to the 2x2 case, which is a rather restricted class of games.\n2. The authors do not provide a clear explanation of why their techniques cannot be extended to more general games.\n3. The paper does not provide a systematic treatment of the question of average-case performance, as mentioned by Reviewer 1.\n4. The authors do not provide a clear comparison with prior works, such as PP16, which is mentioned by Reviewer 2.\n5. The paper's results are only marginally significant or novel, as mentioned by Reviewers 2, 3, and 4.\n\n**Reviewer Comments:**\n\n1. Reviewer 1 mentions that the paper's results are partial and that the formal results remain incomplete.\n2. Reviewer 2 mentions that the paper does not provide enough credit to prior works, such as PP16, and that the results are only marginally significant or novel.\n3. Reviewer 3 mentions that the paper's results are very partial and feel preliminary in nature, and that the geometric approach may not generalize to other game classes.\n4. Reviewer 4 mentions that the paper's contribution should be expressed more clearly and that the class of games considered is rather restricted.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the reviewer comments and the analysis above, I conclude that the paper has some strengths, but also several weaknesses. While the paper addresses an important problem and provides a systematic comparison of different optimal learning dynamics, the main results are limited to the 2x2 case, and the authors do not provide a clear explanation of why their techniques cannot be extended to more general games. Additionally, the paper does not provide a clear comparison with prior works and the results are only marginally significant or novel.\n\nTherefore, I recommend **Rejecting** the paper for publication at this top-tier conference.\n\n**Reasoning for Rejection:**\n\nWhile the paper has some interesting aspects, the main results are limited to a rather restricted class of games, and the authors do not provide a clear explanation of why their techniques cannot be extended to more general games. Additionally, the paper does not provide a clear comparison with prior works and the results are only marginally significant or novel. Therefore, the paper does not meet the high standards of a top-tier conference.\n\n**Recommendations for Future Work:**\n\n1. The authors should extend their results to more general games and provide a clear explanation of why their techniques cannot be extended to more general games.\n2. The authors should provide a clear comparison with prior works, such as PP16, and highlight the novelty and significance of their results.\n3. The authors should provide a more systematic treatment of the question of average-case performance and provide a clear explanation of their results.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"
