      "response": "The paper titled \"SGD Learns One-Layer Networks in WGANs\" presents an analysis of the convergence of stochastic gradient descent-ascent (SGD) for training Wasserstein GANs (WGANs) with a one-layer generator network. The authors claim that their work demonstrates convergence to a global solution in polynomial time and sample complexity. However, the reviewers have raised several critical concerns that need to be addressed to determine the suitability of this paper for a top-tier conference.\n\n1. **Simplified Discriminator Models**: The primary concern across all reviewers is the use of overly simplified discriminator models, specifically linear and quadratic discriminators. These models do not align with the standard practice in WGANs, which typically involve more complex neural network discriminators. The simplification undermines the applicability and relevance of the results to real-world WGAN training scenarios. Reviewer 1 and Reviewer 2 both emphasize that the choice of discriminator limits the generalizability of the findings and does not capture the essence of WGANs, which aim to approximate the Wasserstein distance using complex neural networks.\n\n2. **Misleading Claims**: Reviewer 1 and Reviewer 2 point out that the paper's title and claims may be misleading. The term \"one-layer network\" is ambiguous and could be interpreted in different ways. The paper's focus on simplified models does not support the broader claims about SGD learning in WGANs, as the results are not easily extendable to more complex and practical settings.\n\n3. **Lack of Extension to Complex Models**: Reviewer 3 highlights that the analysis provided in the paper cannot be easily extended to more complex discriminator models due to potential issues with error propagation in the gradient ascent step. This limitation further questions the practical impact of the theoretical results presented.\n\n4. **Insufficient Addressing of Reviewer Concerns**: Reviewer 1 notes that the authors' responses did not adequately address the concerns raised, particularly regarding the treatment of quadratic discriminators as WGANs and the lack of revisions to clarify these points.\n\n5. **Theoretical Contribution vs. Practical Relevance**: While Reviewer 2 acknowledges the theoretical contribution of analyzing gradient descent-ascent, the practical relevance is questioned due to the simplified setting. The theoretical insights, although valid, may not translate to practical improvements in WGAN training with standard neural network discriminators.\n\nIn summary, while the paper provides a theoretical analysis of SGD convergence in a simplified WGAN setting, the limitations in model complexity and the potential for misleading claims significantly detract from its suitability for a top-tier conference. The paper's contributions, although theoretically interesting, do not sufficiently advance the understanding or practice of WGAN training in realistic scenarios.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

      "response": "The paper \"Differentiable Hebbian Consolidation for Continual Learning\" presents a novel approach to addressing the problem of catastrophic forgetting in neural networks through the use of Differentiable Hebbian Plasticity (DHP) Softmax layers. The paper is well-motivated and grounded in cognitive principles, and it introduces a method that is compatible with differentiable programming frameworks. However, there are several critical points to consider when evaluating the paper for a top-tier conference.\n\n1. **Novelty and Contribution**: The paper introduces a new framework that combines Hebbian learning principles with differentiable programming. This is a novel approach and contributes to the field of continual learning by proposing a method that can potentially reduce forgetting. However, the novelty is somewhat diminished by the fact that the method primarily shows improvements when combined with existing synaptic consolidation methods, rather than standing out on its own.\n\n2. **Clarity and Presentation**: While the paper is generally well-written, there are areas where clarity is lacking, particularly in the technical details of the DHP Softmax. Reviewer 2 highlights confusion regarding the indexing in equations and the motivation for applying the Hebbian strategy only to the final softmax layer. These issues suggest that the paper could benefit from additional explanations and possibly illustrative figures to enhance understanding.\n\n3. **Empirical Evaluation**: The empirical evaluation is a significant concern. The paper primarily evaluates the method on MNIST variants and a vision dataset mixture, which are relatively simple benchmarks. Reviewers 1, 3, and 4 express concerns about the lack of evaluation on more challenging datasets like CIFAR-100 or CORe50, which are standard in the continual learning literature. The results on the simpler datasets are mixed, with the proposed method not consistently outperforming baselines or other methods.\n\n4. **Comparison with Existing Methods**: Reviewer 3 points out the lack of comparison with other CLS-based approaches, which is a gap in the experimental validation. Additionally, the method's performance relative to synaptic consolidation methods is not convincingly superior, as noted by Reviewer 4.\n\n5. **Potential for Improvement**: The paper has potential, particularly if the authors address the clarity issues and expand the empirical evaluation to include more challenging and diverse datasets. Demonstrating scalability and effectiveness in more complex settings would strengthen the paper significantly.\n\nIn conclusion, while the paper presents an interesting idea and has potential, the current version lacks the empirical rigor and clarity expected at a top-tier conference. The method's novelty is somewhat overshadowed by its reliance on existing techniques for strong performance, and the evaluation does not convincingly demonstrate its superiority or scalability.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

      "response": "The paper titled \"Depth-Width Trade-offs for ReLU Networks via Sharkovsky's Theorem\" presents a novel approach to understanding the expressivity of deep neural networks (DNNs) by leveraging Sharkovsky's Theorem from dynamical systems. The authors aim to address an open question posed by Telgarsky regarding the characterization of functions that cannot be well-approximated by shallow networks. The paper introduces a connection between DNN expressivity and periodic points, providing lower bounds for the width needed to represent periodic functions as a function of depth.\n\n### Strengths:\n1. **Novelty and Contribution**: The paper introduces a novel application of Sharkovsky's Theorem to the field of deep learning, providing a new perspective on depth-width trade-offs in ReLU networks. This is a significant theoretical contribution that addresses an open question in the literature.\n\n2. **Theoretical Rigor**: The proofs and theoretical results are well-structured and appear to be correct, as noted by Reviewer 2. The use of dynamical systems and eigenvalue analysis to derive the results is both innovative and technically sound.\n\n3. **Clarity and Exposition**: Reviewers have praised the paper for its clear exposition, particularly the explanation of Sharkovsky's Theorem and its implications for neural networks. The paper is described as a delight to read, indicating that it is well-written and accessible to its intended audience.\n\n4. **Reviewer Enthusiasm**: All reviewers express strong support for the paper, with Reviewer 1 giving it the maximum score and Reviewer 2 strongly suggesting acceptance. This indicates a consensus on the paper's quality and significance.\n\n### Weaknesses:\n1. **Practical Implications**: Reviewer 3 raises a valid concern about the practical applicability of the theoretical results. While the paper broadens theoretical understanding, it lacks guidance on how to apply these results to real-world tasks, such as assessing or approximating the period for a given classification task.\n\n2. **Structure and Presentation**: Reviewer 3 suggests that the paper's structure could be improved by presenting the main theorem earlier and providing more intuition for some definitions. This could enhance the paper's readability and accessibility, particularly for readers less familiar with the mathematical background.\n\n3. **Additional Analysis**: Reviewer 2 requests additional analysis on the impact of a bias term and the sharpness of the lower bound. While these are not necessary for publication, addressing them could strengthen the paper's contribution and provide deeper insights.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe paper makes a significant theoretical contribution to the understanding of depth-width trade-offs in ReLU networks by applying Sharkovsky's Theorem. Despite some concerns about practical applicability and presentation, the paper's novelty, theoretical rigor, and positive reception by reviewers make it a strong candidate for acceptance. The suggestions for improvement, such as restructuring and providing additional intuition, can be addressed in the final version.\n\nFinal Decision: Accept"

The paper aims to address the challenges of modeling dynamic graphs at multiple time resolutions and introduces several mechanisms, such as time gates, attention mechanisms, and a selection mechanism for important nodes.\n\n**Strengths:**\n1. **Relevance and Importance:** The problem of modeling time-evolving graphs is significant, with applications in various domains such as social networks and fraud detection.\n2. **Empirical Performance:** The paper reports improved empirical performance on multiple datasets, which suggests that the proposed method is effective in practice.\n3. **Novelty in Combination:** While individual components like LSTM, attention mechanisms, and temporal point processes are not novel, their combination in this context is somewhat innovative.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n1. **Lack of Novelty:** Both reviewers highlight that the individual components of the proposed method are not novel. The main novelty lies in the combination of these components, which is considered of limited novelty for a top-tier conference.\n2. **Insufficient Justification and Analysis:** There is a lack of detailed analysis and justification for the proposed mechanisms. For instance, the paper does not adequately demonstrate how the stacked LSTM captures multiple time resolutions or how the attention mechanism effectively selects relevant nodes.\n3. **Missing Comparisons:** The paper does not compare its method with JODIE, a recent and relevant baseline, which is a significant oversight. Such comparisons are crucial for establishing the method's relative performance.\n4. **Experimental Concerns:** The experimental setup raises concerns, such as the potential for the proposed method to have more parameters than the baselines, which could explain the performance improvements. Additionally, the paper does not use commonly accepted benchmarks, limiting the comparability of results.\n5. **Clarity and Readability:** Reviewer 3 points out that the paper is difficult to understand, lacking clarity in how the components work together and how the method handles dynamic graph changes. An overview diagram or toy example could improve readability.\n6. **Computational Cost:** There is no discussion of the computational cost or scalability of the proposed method, which is important for practical applications.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe paper addresses an important problem and shows promising empirical results. However, the lack of novelty, insufficient analysis, missing comparisons with relevant baselines, and issues with clarity and experimental setup are significant drawbacks. For a top-tier conference, these weaknesses outweigh the strengths, as the contribution does not meet the high standards of novelty, rigor, and clarity expected.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

      "response": "The paper \"Gradient-based training of Gaussian Mixture Models in High-Dimensional Spaces\" presents a novel approach to training Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) in high-dimensional spaces. The authors propose several innovations, including a max-component approximation for numerical stability, a new regularizer to avoid pathological local minima, and a method for enforcing GMM constraints in SGD. They also introduce an SGD-compatible simplification of the GMM model to manage memory usage.\n\n**Strengths:**\n1. **Relevance and Novelty:** The paper addresses a relevant problem in machine learning, particularly in the context of high-dimensional data. The use of SGD for GMMs is a novel approach that could offer computational advantages over traditional methods like EM.\n2. **Implementation:** The authors provide a publicly available TensorFlow implementation, which is a valuable resource for the community.\n3. **Clarity:** The paper is generally well-written and clear, making it accessible to readers.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n1. **Incremental Contribution:** Reviewers 1 and 3 note that the contributions, particularly the max-component approximation, are incremental and do not significantly advance the state of the art. The max-component trick is a known technique, and the paper does not convincingly demonstrate its superiority over existing methods.\n2. **Experimental Evaluation:** The experimental results are not compelling. The datasets used (e.g., MNIST and SVHN) are not truly high-dimensional, and the results do not convincingly demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method over EM with K-means initialization. Reviewer 2 highlights the lack of convergence guarantees and the need for stronger empirical results.\n3. **Theoretical Justification:** There is a lack of theoretical guarantees for convergence or performance, which is a significant drawback for a top-tier conference. The paper relies heavily on empirical results, which are not sufficiently strong to compensate for this lack.\n4. **Regularization and Smoothing:** The regularization approach and the smoothing technique are not well-justified theoretically. Reviewers express confusion about the motivation and implementation details, indicating a need for clearer explanations and justifications.\n5. **Comparison with Baselines:** The paper does not provide a thorough comparison with existing methods, particularly EM with K-means initialization. The practical advantages of the proposed method are not clearly demonstrated.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile the paper presents an interesting approach to training GMMs with SGD, it falls short in several critical areas. The contributions are incremental, the experimental results are not compelling, and there is a lack of theoretical justification and comprehensive comparison with existing methods. For a top-tier conference, the paper needs to provide either a significant theoretical advancement or exceptionally strong empirical results, neither of which is present here.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

This oversight questions the novelty and contribution of the proposed method.\n\n3. **Experimental Evaluation**: The experimental section is deemed insufficient by the reviewers. Reviewer 2 suggests adding relevant baselines and comparisons to demonstrate the effectiveness of the attention component. Reviewer 4 also emphasizes the need for strong experimental comparisons with recent works to validate the proposed method's superiority.\n\n4. **Technical Details and Justification**: There are several technical ambiguities and missing details in the paper. Reviewer 2 and Reviewer 4 highlight issues with the explanation of the attention mechanism, task dependency matrices, and the overall framework. The justification for the hierarchical task dependency is also not convincingly presented, as noted by Reviewer 4.\n\n5. **Rebuttal and Revisions**: Although the authors have attempted to address some of the reviewers' concerns in their rebuttal, the revisions do not sufficiently resolve the major issues identified. The lack of a clear distinction from existing methods and the absence of comprehensive experimental validation remain significant drawbacks.\n\nIn conclusion, while the paper presents an interesting approach to multi-task learning, the issues related to clarity, novelty, experimental validation, and technical details are too significant to overlook.

The reviewers have provided extensive feedback, highlighting several critical issues with the paper.\n\n1. **Theoretical Foundation and Novelty:**\n   - The paper aims to generalize existing discrepancy measures like MMD and KSD. However, the reviewers note that the theoretical contributions are not well-founded. Reviewer 1 points out that key definitions are unclear and potentially misnamed, questioning the fundamental understanding of the kernel concept. Reviewer 3 also questions the relevance of the proposed setting, especially in discrete contexts where labels do not naturally relate to distances.\n   - There is a lack of rigorous proofs and missing sections, such as the proof of Theorem 5 and the connection with Bernstein polynomials. Reviewer 2 mentions that the theoretical manipulations are elementary and mostly follow existing literature, indicating a lack of significant innovation.\n\n2. **Experimental Evaluation:**\n   - A major shortcoming is the complete absence of experimental evaluation. Reviewer 2 and Reviewer 3 both emphasize the need for experiments to validate the proposed methods, especially in a field where empirical results are crucial for demonstrating the utility of new statistical methods.\n\n3. **Presentation and Clarity:**\n   - The paper suffers from numerous grammatical errors, unclear notation, and a lack of coherent structure, as noted by all reviewers. This makes the paper difficult to follow and undermines the communication of the proposed ideas.\n   - Reviewer 4 highlights inconsistencies in definitions and notations, which further complicates understanding the paper's contributions.\n\n4. **Practical Relevance and Application:**\n   - The practical application of the proposed methods is not well-justified. Reviewer 4 questions the applicability of the proposed kernels in two-sample tests, especially given the need to know the distributions p and q, which is not typically feasible in such tests.\n\n5. **Literature Review and Context:**\n   - The paper lacks a thorough literature review and fails to adequately position its contributions within the existing body of work. Reviewer 4 suggests additional references that could provide context and support for the proposed methods.\n\nOverall, the paper presents an interesting idea of generalizing probability kernels, but it falls short in execution across multiple dimensions: theoretical rigor, empirical validation, clarity of presentation, and practical applicability.

This is a significant concern for a top-tier conference, where originality and contribution to the field are paramount. The authors need to clearly articulate what new insights or advancements their work provides over existing studies.\n\n2. **Clarity and Detail**: There are several comments regarding the lack of clarity in the description of data and methods. Reviewer 3 mentions that the features used as inputs are not clearly described, and there is confusion about the representation of these features. Additionally, the motivation for using a bidirectional LSTM is not well justified, and the connection to the biological context is weak.\n\n3. **Evaluation and Baselines**: The evaluation of the model is not robust. Reviewers 1 and 3 both highlight the need for a fair comparison with other models using the same loss function. The paper should include additional baseline models and evaluation metrics to strengthen the claims of improved performance. The use of a modified weighted MSE as a loss function should be justified and compared with other common loss functions.\n\n4. **Generalizability**: Reviewer 1 raises concerns about the generalizability of the approach to other datasets and epigenetic features. The paper should address how the proposed method can be applied to different organisms or datasets beyond the specific case of Drosophila melanogaster.\n\n5. **Technical Issues and Presentation**: There are several technical issues and presentation errors noted by the reviewers, such as unclear equations, incorrect labels in figures, and lack of formalization in certain sections.

This strengthens the credibility of the theoretical results.\n\n4. **Well-Written and Referenced:** The paper is well-written, self-contained, and well-referenced, making it accessible to readers familiar with the topic.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n1. **Length and Complexity:** Both reviewers noted that the paper is long and potentially difficult for a general audience to parse. The extensive appendix, while thorough, may overwhelm readers and detract from the main contributions.\n\n2. **Appendix Organization:** The organization of the appendix could be improved to emphasize the main techniques and ideas. Some theorems referenced in the appendix are not mentioned in the main text, which could confuse readers.\n\n3. **Gap in CIFAR10 Experiment:** There is a noted gap between theory and experiment in the CIFAR10 dataset, although this is partially mitigated by the agreement with theory in the ReLU experiment.\n\n4. **Clarity in Presentation:** Some parts of the paper, such as the explanation of the DZXP setting and certain assumptions, could be clarified to improve understanding.\n\n**Reviewer Consensus:**\n\nBoth reviewers acknowledge the paper's significant theoretical contributions and the importance of the topic. Reviewer 1 appreciates the theoretical analysis and empirical validation but suggests improvements in clarity and organization. Reviewer 2 strongly supports acceptance, highlighting the paper's thoroughness and the interesting use of polynomial approximations.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nGiven the paper's substantial theoretical contributions, empirical validation, and relevance to the field of deep learning, it meets the standards of a top-tier conference.

The paper is well-written and the idea is clearly explained, which is a positive aspect noted by multiple reviewers. The approach is computationally efficient as it does not require fine-tuning the entire model, which is an attractive feature for practical applications.\n\n**Strengths:**\n1. **Novelty and Simplicity:** The idea of using binary masks to identify subnetworks responsible for different text features is novel and straightforward. It avoids the need for training a disentangled model from scratch.\n2. **Computational Efficiency:** The method is computationally efficient as it does not require fine-tuning the entire model, which is beneficial for large-scale applications.\n3. **Clarity and Writing:** The paper is well-written and easy to understand, which is crucial for conveying complex ideas effectively.\n4. **Potential Impact:** The approach has the potential to impact the field by providing a new way to achieve disentangled representations without extensive computational resources.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n1. **Generality and Scope:** Several reviewers raised concerns about the generality of the approach. The experiments are limited to a specific domain (movie reviews) and only two genres, which questions the broader applicability of the method.\n2. **Experimental Results:** The experimental results do not convincingly demonstrate superiority over existing methods. Some reviewers noted that the proposed method does not outperform fine-tuned baselines in certain tasks.\n3. **Lack of Benchmarking:** The paper lacks benchmarking against standard datasets and tasks, which is essential for assessing the method's effectiveness in a broader context.\n4. **Attribute Leakage:** There is still a fair amount of attribute leakage, and the probe used to measure this is relatively weak, which might not fully capture the extent of leakage.\n5. **Scalability Concerns:** The method increases the number of parameters significantly, which could be a concern for scalability, especially when dealing with multiple attributes.\n\n**Reviewer Concerns:**\n- The paper does not adequately address the generality of the approach across different domains and tasks.\n- There is a lack of discussion on the performance of the method in comparison to fine-tuned baselines, especially in semantic tasks.\n- The paper does not explore the potential of the disentangled representations in downstream tasks, which could demonstrate the practical utility of the approach.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile the paper presents an interesting and novel approach, the concerns about the generality, experimental validation, and lack of benchmarking against standard datasets are significant. The paper does not convincingly demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches or that it is applicable to a wide range of tasks and domains. For a top-tier conference, it is crucial that the paper not only presents a novel idea but also provides strong empirical evidence of its effectiveness and generality.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

The paper builds on the work of van Hoof et al. (2017) and extends it to deep RL methods, specifically targeting continuous control tasks.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n1. **Novelty and Contribution:** The paper introduces a scalable exploration framework for deep RL, which is a significant contribution given the challenges in exploration for deep RL methods. The approach of modeling the last layer parameters as latent variables and using recursive inference is innovative and addresses the scalability issue of previous methods.\n\n2. **Empirical Results:** The method shows strong empirical results for on-policy methods (A2C and PPO), with significant performance improvements over baselines. The detailed ablation studies and the comprehensive appendix enhance the reproducibility and understanding of the method.\n\n3. **Clarity and Presentation:** The paper is generally well-written, with clear explanations of the proposed method and its theoretical underpinnings. The introduction and related work sections are particularly well-done, situating the work within the broader RL literature.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n1. **Off-Policy Performance:** The method does not perform as well with off-policy methods like SAC, and the results are not as strong as those for on-policy methods. This is a significant limitation, as SAC is a state-of-the-art method for continuous control tasks.\n\n2. **Limited Experimental Scope:** The experiments are limited to Mujoco tasks, which may not fully demonstrate the method's effectiveness in more complex or diverse environments. Additional experiments on tasks with sparse rewards or pure exploration challenges would strengthen the paper.\n\n3. **Complexity and Practicality:** The proposed method introduces additional complexity, particularly for off-policy methods, without a clear performance benefit. This raises concerns about the practical significance and applicability of the method in real-world scenarios.\n\n4. **Connection to Prior Work:** While the paper builds on van Hoof et al. (2017), some reviewers feel that the contribution is not sufficiently distinct from the prior work, particularly for the off-policy case.\n\n**Reviewer Consensus:**\n\nThe reviewers generally appreciate the novelty and potential impact of the method, particularly for on-policy methods. However, there are concerns about the off-policy performance, the limited experimental scope, and the practical significance of the method. Reviewer 1 suggests reframing the method as primarily an on-policy approach, which could address some of these concerns.\n\n**Final Decision:**\n\nGiven the strengths in novelty and on-policy performance, but considering the significant weaknesses in off-policy performance and experimental scope, the paper presents a mixed case. For a top-tier conference, the expectation is for a method to demonstrate strong performance across a range of settings and to have clear practical significance. While the paper has potential, the limitations, particularly in off-policy settings, are substantial.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

The authors aim to address the limitations of previous methods that depend on the norm of input vectors, which can be problematic when the mean itself has a large norm. Instead, the proposed method focuses on the distance between inputs, providing a more robust solution in such scenarios.\n\n### Strengths:\n1. **Novelty and Contribution**: The paper introduces a new quantization method using lattice theory, which is a significant contribution to the field of distributed machine learning. This approach allows for error bounds that are independent of the input norm, addressing a critical limitation in existing methods.\n\n2. **Theoretical Rigor**: The authors provide both upper and lower bounds for the communication-to-error trade-off, demonstrating the asymptotic optimality of their algorithms. This theoretical foundation is crucial for a top-tier conference.\n\n3. **Practical Implementation**: The paper not only presents a theoretical framework but also discusses practical implementations using cubic lattices, which are computationally feasible and only incur a logarithmic factor loss in accuracy.\n\n4. **Experimental Validation**: Although limited, the experiments show practical improvements over prior approaches, supporting the theoretical claims.\n\n5. **Clarity and Motivation**: Reviewers generally agree that the paper is well-written, with a clear problem statement and motivation. The overview of prior work is comprehensive, situating the contribution within the broader research landscape.\n\n### Weaknesses:\n1. **Literature Review and Discussion**: Reviewer 1 suggests that the paper could benefit from a more extensive discussion of related work, particularly in non-distributed settings. This could strengthen the paper by situating it more firmly within the existing body of research.\n\n2. **Algorithmic Details**: Reviewer 2 requests a more straightforward description of the computationally simple algorithm via reduction to $\\ell_\\infty$, which could enhance the paper's accessibility.\n\n3. **Experimental Limitations**: The experiments are limited to $n=2$, which is not very expressive for a distributed setting. Larger-scale experiments would provide stronger evidence of the method's practical applicability.\n\n4. **Minor Errors and Typos**: Several minor errors and typos were noted by the reviewers, which need to be addressed to improve the paper's polish.\n\n5. **Communication Cost**: Reviewer 3 raises a valid point about the communication cost of setting up the network (e.g., electing a leader or forming a binary tree), which is not accounted for in the analysis.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe paper presents a significant advancement in the field of distributed mean estimation by addressing a fundamental limitation of previous methods.

However, there are several critical issues that need to be addressed before considering it for publication in a top-tier conference.\n\n1. **Novelty and Contribution**: Reviewer 3 points out that the paper lacks methodological novelty and is similar to previously published works, which are not cited. This is a significant concern for a top-tier conference, where originality and contribution to the field are crucial. The authors need to clearly articulate what new insights or advancements their work provides over existing studies.\n\n2. **Clarity and Detail**: There are several comments regarding the lack of clarity in the paper. Reviewer 2 mentions that the equation is not clearly presented, and Reviewer 3 highlights that the description of data and methods is not clear enough. The paper needs to provide a detailed and clear explanation of the methods, including how features are represented and the rationale behind the choice of models.\n\n3. **Evaluation and Baselines**: The evaluation of the proposed model is not robust. Reviewer 1 and Reviewer 3 both suggest that the comparison with other models is not fair due to the use of different loss functions. The authors should ensure that all models are evaluated using the same metrics and provide additional baseline models for comparison. Moreover, the use of additional evaluation metrics like MSE and R^2 score is recommended to strengthen the evaluation.\n\n4. **Generalizability**: Reviewer 1 raises concerns about the generalizability of the approach, particularly the specificity of the loss function and its applicability to other datasets or epigenetic features. The authors should address these concerns by demonstrating the model's performance on diverse datasets and discussing its potential generalizability.\n\n5. **Feature Importance and Model Interpretation**: Reviewer 3 suggests that the paper lacks an analysis of feature importance for the biLSTM model. Understanding which features are important and how the model makes predictions is crucial for biological applications. The authors should provide an analysis of feature importance and discuss the biological significance of the findings.\n\n6. **Technical Issues and Improvements**: There are several technical issues and suggestions for improvement, such as clarifying the use of the biLSTM, addressing the choice of the center LSTM hidden state, and correcting errors in figures and text. These need to be addressed to improve the overall quality of the paper.\n\nIn summary, while the paper presents an interesting application of machine learning to a biological problem, it currently lacks the novelty, clarity, and robust evaluation required for acceptance in a top-tier conference.

While the paper tackles an interesting and challenging problem, several critical issues have been identified by the reviewers that need to be addressed before it can be considered for acceptance at a top-tier conference.\n\n1. **Evaluation and Metrics**: The primary concern across multiple reviews is the weak evaluation of the proposed models. The metrics used, such as \"Vocalness\" and \"Average Pitch,\" are criticized for not adequately capturing the quality of singing voice generation. The lack of a baseline comparison further exacerbates this issue, making it difficult to assess the success of the proposed methods.\n\n2. **Motivation and Justification**: The motivation for the chosen task settings is not clearly articulated. Reviewers have pointed out that the paper does not sufficiently explain why these specific tasks are important or what insights can be gained from their performance differences. Additionally, the choice of neural network architecture and the adaptation of BEGAN for sequence generation are not well justified with experimental results or literature support.\n\n3. **Dataset and Training Details**: There is a lack of clarity regarding the datasets used for training and evaluation. Reviewers have noted confusion about the genres and types of data included, as well as concerns about the quality of the training data due to the use of source separation. This lack of transparency hinders the ability to evaluate the generalizability and robustness of the models.\n\n4. **Comparison with Existing Methods**: The paper does not provide a comparison with existing methods, such as those using MIDI representations or state-of-the-art singing voice synthesis models. This omission makes it difficult to position the work within the broader context of singing voice generation research.\n\n5. **Literature Review and Writing**: While the paper is generally well-structured, there are areas where the literature review could be expanded, particularly regarding neural network-based singing voice synthesis. Additionally, some writing issues and unclear explanations detract from the overall clarity of the paper.\n\n6. **Novelty and Contribution**: The paper introduces a new problem and provides a baseline for future research. However, the novelty of the approach is somewhat overshadowed by the lack of strong experimental validation and theoretical justification.\n\nIn summary, while the paper addresses an interesting and novel problem, the issues related to evaluation, motivation, dataset clarity, and comparison with existing methods are significant.

They argue that the idea of using attention to capture features from distant nodes is not new and that similar concepts have been explored in previous works like ChevNet and Non-Local Graph Neural Networks.\n\n2. **Complexity Issues:** A significant concern raised by multiple reviewers (1 and 4) is the computational complexity of the proposed method. The need to compute a full matrix eigen decomposition and the global attention mechanism's scalability are questioned. The authors' claims about complexity reduction are not convincingly supported, and this could limit the method's applicability to larger graphs.\n\n3. **Limited Experimental Scope:** The datasets used for evaluating disassortative graphs are relatively small, which raises questions about the method's scalability and effectiveness on larger, real-world graphs. Reviewer 3 suggests additional experiments on synthetic graphs to better understand the method's performance across different graph types.\n\n4. **Lack of Theoretical Results:** Reviewer 2 notes the absence of theoretical results, which could strengthen the paper's contributions. While the empirical results are promising, theoretical guarantees or insights would enhance the paper's impact.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWhile the paper addresses a relevant problem and presents a method with a solid theoretical basis, the concerns about novelty, computational complexity, and limited experimental validation on larger datasets are significant. The reviewers' feedback indicates that the paper does not meet the high standards required for a top-tier conference, particularly given the unresolved issues around scalability and the lack of clear differentiation from existing methods.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

      "response": "The paper titled \"PROGRESSIVE LEARNING AND DISENTANGLEMENT OF HIERARCHICAL REPRESENTATIONS\" presents a novel approach to learning hierarchical representations using a progressive learning strategy in the context of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). The authors propose a method that incrementally activates layers in a ladder architecture, aiming to improve disentanglement of representations.\n\n### Strengths:\n1. **Novelty and Contribution**: The paper introduces a fresh idea of combining progressive learning with hierarchical representation learning in VAEs, which is not extensively explored in the literature. This approach is innovative and has the potential to open new avenues for research in disentangled representation learning.\n\n2. **Experimental Validation**: The authors provide both qualitative and quantitative evidence supporting their claims. They conduct experiments on benchmark datasets and introduce a new metric (MIG-sup) to evaluate disentanglement, which adds value to the paper.\n\n3. **Rebuttal Improvements**: The authors have addressed several concerns raised by the reviewers in their rebuttal. They provided additional experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness of their method compared to the baseline VLAE, particularly in terms of disentanglement and information flow.\n\n4. **Clarity and Presentation**: The paper is generally well-written and easy to follow. The motivation for the work is clear, and the results are presented in a convincing manner.\n\n### Weaknesses:\n1. **Lack of Clarity in Purpose**: Reviewer 2 pointed out that the paper lacks clarity in distinguishing between the goals of learning hierarchical versus disentangled representations. This confusion could be addressed by better articulating the relationship between these two concepts.\n\n2. **Comparative Analysis**: While the authors compare their method to VLAE, some reviewers suggest that a more thorough comparison, including ablation studies, would strengthen the paper. Specifically, understanding the individual contributions of progressive learning and other implementation strategies would be beneficial.\n\n3. **Metric Limitations**: The proposed MIG-sup metric, while innovative, requires ground truth for generative factors, which limits its applicability in real-world scenarios where such ground truth is not available.\n\n4. **Reproducibility Concerns**: Some details, such as the definition of certain variables in equations, are missing, which could hinder reproducibility. This needs to be addressed to ensure that other researchers can replicate the results.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe paper presents a promising approach to disentangled representation learning using progressive learning strategies. Despite some weaknesses, particularly in clarity and comparative analysis, the authors have made significant improvements in response to reviewer feedback. The novelty of the approach, combined with the additional experiments provided in the rebuttal, suggests that the paper has the potential to make a meaningful contribution to the field.\n\nFinal Decision: Accept"

However, several critical issues have been identified by the reviewers, which collectively suggest that the paper is not ready for publication in a top-tier conference. Here is a detailed analysis of the paper's strengths and weaknesses:\n\n1. **Novelty and Contribution**:\n   - The paper introduces a new reduction algorithm for ReLU networks, which is a relevant and timely topic given the ongoing interest in model compression and efficiency.\n   - However, the novelty of the approach is questioned by multiple reviewers, as the techniques of removing inactive neurons and combining always-active neurons are not particularly novel. These ideas have been explored in existing literature on network pruning.\n\n2. **Clarity and Presentation**:\n   - The paper suffers from significant clarity and presentation issues. Important concepts are explained in footnotes rather than the main text, and many definitions are missing or unclear.\n   - The paper is poorly organized, making it difficult to follow. There are numerous typos and grammatical errors, which further detract from the readability and professionalism expected at a top-tier conference.\n\n3. **Theoretical Foundation**:\n   - The paper heavily relies on unpublished work by the authors, which is not adequately detailed or accessible for verification. This reliance on unpublished work undermines the credibility and verifiability of the proposed method.\n   - The theoretical contributions are not presented rigorously, and key results are not framed as theorems or supported by proofs.\n\n4. **Experimental Validation**:\n   - The experimental evaluation is insufficient. The experiments are limited to toy datasets and MNIST, which are not challenging enough to demonstrate the effectiveness of the pruning technique.\n   - There is a lack of comparison with existing state-of-the-art pruning methods, which is crucial to establish the competitiveness of the proposed approach.\n   - The experiments do not provide statistical significance measures, such as standard errors, to support the claims of performance preservation.\n\n5. **Reviewers' Consensus**:\n   - All reviewers express concerns about the paper's readiness for publication. They highlight issues with clarity, insufficient experimental validation, and reliance on unpublished work.\n   - The reviewers recommend rejection due to the inability to verify the correctness of the technique and the lack of convincing experimental results.\n\nIn conclusion, while the paper addresses an important topic, the combination of unclear presentation, insufficient theoretical and experimental validation, and reliance on unpublished work makes it unsuitable for acceptance at a top-tier conference at this time. The authors are encouraged to address these issues, improve the clarity and rigor of their presentation, and provide more comprehensive experimental validation in future submissions.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

The development of new technical tools to analytically bound and estimate this error is a significant theoretical advancement.\n\n2. **Interesting Topic:** The paper addresses an important question in deep learning regarding the roles of architecture and gradient descent in generalization, which is a topic of active research and interest.\n\n3. **Clarity and Writing:** The paper is generally well-written and presents its ideas clearly, making it accessible to readers.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n1. **Experimental Limitations:** Multiple reviewers pointed out that the experimental validation is lacking. The experiments are not comprehensive enough to support the claims, particularly regarding the implicit bias of gradient descent. The use of the \"Nero\" optimizer instead of standard GD or SGD raises concerns about the generality of the findings.\n\n2. **Incremental Contributions:** Some reviewers noted that the contributions, particularly the PAC-Bayes bound, are incremental and build heavily on previous work (e.g., Valle-Pérez et al. (2019)). The improvements over existing results are not substantial enough for a top-tier conference.\n\n3. **Lack of Rigorous Margin Analysis:** The discussion on margin and its role in generalization is not rigorous enough. Reviewers found the claims about gradient descent's implicit bias related to margin unconvincing and lacking theoretical support.\n\n4. **Limited Applicability:** The theoretical results are primarily applicable to MLPs and do not extend to more complex architectures like CNNs or ResNets, which limits the practical significance of the findings.\n\n5. **Overpromise and Under-delivery:** The paper promises a comprehensive analysis of both architectural and optimization biases but falls short in delivering a balanced and thorough investigation of both aspects.\n\n**Reviewer Consensus:**\n\nThe majority of reviewers lean towards rejection, citing the paper's premature nature, lack of comprehensive experiments, and incremental contributions. While some reviewers acknowledge the potential of the theoretical results, they agree that the paper requires significant improvements in framing, experimental validation, and clarity of claims.\n\n**Author Responses:**\n\nThe authors provided clarifications and addressed some misunderstandings, but the core concerns about experimental validation and the rigor of the margin analysis remain unresolved.

The paper is well-written and provides a clear structure, with all claims and statements being well-supported and correct. However, the decision to accept or reject this paper for a top-tier conference requires a careful evaluation of its novelty, significance, and potential impact.\n\n### Strengths:\n1. **Theoretical Contributions**: The paper provides a rigorous theoretical analysis of the FA algorithm, offering convergence guarantees for both continuous and discrete dynamics in deep linear networks. This is a valuable contribution to the understanding of FA, which is an alternative to backpropagation.\n   \n2. **Novel Observations**: The paper identifies an interesting phenomenon of implicit anti-regularization, where certain initializations lead to learning less important components before more important ones. This is contrasted with implicit regularization, where components are learned in decreasing order of importance.\n\n3. **Clarity and Structure**: The paper is well-structured and clearly written, making it accessible to readers interested in the theoretical aspects of neural network training algorithms.\n\n4. **Numerical Experiments**: Although limited, the numerical experiments provided support the theoretical findings and illustrate the behavior of FA compared to gradient descent (GD).\n\n### Weaknesses:\n1. **Limited Scope and Generalizability**: The analysis is primarily limited to linear networks with diagonalizable matrices and specific initializations (spectral initialization). This restricts the applicability of the results to more general settings, particularly non-linear networks, which are more common in practice.\n\n2. **Practical Relevance**: The conditions under which the theoretical results hold (e.g., spectral initialization) are not commonly used in practice. This raises concerns about the practical significance of the findings, as the results may not translate to real-world scenarios where random initialization is prevalent.\n\n3. **Lack of Empirical Validation**: The paper lacks extensive empirical validation under more realistic settings, such as non-spectral initialization. This limits the ability to assess whether the observed phenomena (e.g., implicit anti-regularization) occur in practical applications.\n\n4. **Novelty and Impact**: While the theoretical contributions are interesting, the novelty and impact are somewhat limited by the restrictive assumptions and the focus on linear networks. The gap between the theoretical analysis and practical applications remains significant.\n\n### Reviewer Consensus:\nThe reviewers generally acknowledge the correctness and clarity of the paper but express concerns about the significance and novelty of the contributions. The restrictive assumptions and limited empirical validation are common points of criticism. Reviewer 3 is more positive, highlighting the potential interest to the community, but the other reviewers are more cautious, emphasizing the need for broader applicability and practical relevance.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the strengths and weaknesses outlined above, the paper presents a solid theoretical contribution but falls short in terms of practical relevance and generalizability. The restrictive assumptions and limited empirical validation under realistic settings are significant drawbacks for a top-tier conference. While the paper is well-executed in its theoretical scope, the novelty and impact are not sufficient to warrant acceptance at a top-tier conference without addressing these limitations.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

The reviewers have provided a comprehensive analysis of the paper, highlighting both strengths and weaknesses.\n\n### Strengths:\n1. **Novelty and Relevance**: The paper addresses a significant problem in reinforcement learning, particularly the challenge of adapting to new tasks with sparse rewards by leveraging demonstrations. This is a relevant and timely topic in the field.\n2. **Empirical Results**: The proposed method, PERIL, shows promising empirical results, outperforming existing baselines like PEARL and MetaIL in certain benchmarks.\n3. **Visualization and Analysis**: The paper provides a detailed analysis of the latent space, which helps illustrate the learning process and the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\n### Weaknesses:\n1. **Complexity and Clarity**: The method is complex, involving multiple components and loss terms, which are not clearly explained or justified. This complexity makes it difficult for readers to understand the necessity and function of each part.\n2. **Notation and Mathematical Formulation**: There are inconsistencies and unclear explanations in the mathematical formulation, which add to the confusion. Key terms and equations are not well-defined or explained.\n3. **Lack of Baselines and Ablations**: The paper lacks comparisons with other methods that combine meta-RL and IL, and does not provide sufficient ablation studies to justify the necessity of each component of the method.\n4. **Assumptions and Limitations**: The paper makes strong assumptions, such as the availability of an expert distribution conditioned on the learned latent variable, which may not be realistic in practical scenarios.\n5. **Related Work and Citations**: The paper does not adequately position itself within the existing literature, missing citations of closely related works and failing to clearly differentiate itself from similar methods like PEARL.\n6. **Experimental Design**: The experiments lack statistical rigor, such as multiple seeds and significance tests, and do not convincingly demonstrate the claimed capabilities, such as zero-shot learning and exploration beyond demonstrations.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile the paper presents an interesting approach to combining meta-RL and IL, the significant issues with clarity, complexity, and experimental validation prevent it from meeting the standards of a top-tier conference.

      "response": "The paper titled \"Understanding and Leveraging Overparameterization in Recursive Value Estimation\" presents an analysis of recursive value estimation using overparameterized linear representations in reinforcement learning (RL). The paper aims to provide insights into the utility of deep models in RL by examining classical updates like temporal difference (TD) learning, fitted-value-iteration (FVI), and residual minimization (RM) in the overparameterized regime.\n\n### Strengths:\n1. **Novel Perspective**: The paper offers a novel perspective on the implicit biases of classical value estimation algorithms in the overparameterized setting, which is a significant departure from the traditional underparameterized analysis.\n2. **Unified Interpretation**: It provides a unified interpretation of overparameterized linear value estimation, which could be valuable for understanding the behavior of these algorithms in modern deep RL settings.\n3. **Regularizers**: The introduction of regularizers to improve stability and generalization performance is a practical contribution that could have implications for deep RL applications.\n4. **Theoretical Contributions**: The paper makes theoretical contributions by analyzing the convergence properties and generalization error bounds of the algorithms in the overparameterized regime.\n\n### Weaknesses:\n1. **Lack of Novelty and Credit**: Several reviewers pointed out that some results are not novel and do not adequately credit prior work. For instance, Theorem 4 is criticized for being a well-known result in convex optimization.\n2. **Empirical Evaluation**: The empirical evaluation is considered weak, with experiments conducted in simple environments that do not convincingly demonstrate the practical utility of the proposed methods.\n3. **Connection to Deep RL**: The paper's connection to deep RL is questioned, as the overparameterization in deep RL often involves non-linear models, whereas the paper focuses on linear representations.\n4. **Technical Issues**: There are technical issues and errors in the proofs and derivations, such as incorrect assumptions about matrix decompositions and errors in the application of inequalities.\n5. **Clarity and Writing**: Some reviewers noted that the paper's writing could be improved for clarity, and there are grammatical issues that need addressing.\n\n### Reviewer Consensus:\nThe reviewers are divided in their opinions. Some appreciate the theoretical contributions and the novel perspective on overparameterization, while others are concerned about the lack of novelty, insufficient empirical validation, and technical inaccuracies. The paper's potential impact is limited by its focus on linear models, which may not fully capture the complexities of deep RL.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile the paper presents interesting theoretical insights into overparameterization in value estimation, the concerns about novelty, empirical validation, and technical correctness are significant. For a top-tier conference, the paper needs to demonstrate both strong theoretical contributions and practical relevance, which this paper currently lacks. The issues raised by the reviewers, particularly regarding the novelty and empirical significance, suggest that the paper is not yet ready for acceptance at a top-tier conference.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

Some claims, such as the relationship between saturation and generalization, are not well-supported or are contradictory.\n3. **Limited Practical Impact:** While the findings are interesting, the practical impact is limited because the Swap model with bounded activations does not outperform the conventional model with ReLU, which is widely used in practice.\n4. **Scope of Analysis:** The analysis is limited to specific architectures without residual connections, which restricts the generalizability of the findings to more commonly used architectures like ResNets.\n5. **Reviewer Concerns:** Multiple reviewers expressed concerns about the clarity and rigor of the claims, as well as the novelty and significance of the contributions. These concerns were not fully addressed in the author responses.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile the paper presents an interesting observation, the lack of a strong theoretical foundation, inconsistencies in the results, and limited practical impact make it unsuitable for acceptance at a top-tier conference. The paper would benefit from a more comprehensive theoretical analysis and a broader scope of experiments to strengthen its claims and demonstrate practical significance.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

      "response": "The paper titled \"MCTransformer: Combining Transformers And Monte-Carlo Tree Search For Offline Reinforcement Learning\" presents a novel approach by integrating Transformers with Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) in the context of offline reinforcement learning. The authors claim that this combination allows for more efficient sampling and improved performance over existing methods. However, the paper has several critical issues that need to be addressed before it can be considered for acceptance at a top-tier conference.\n\n### Detailed Reasoning:\n\n1. **Novelty and Contribution:**\n   - The idea of combining Transformers with MCTS is interesting and potentially impactful. However, as pointed out by the reviewers, the novelty is limited because the approach closely resembles existing frameworks like AlphaGo/AlphaZero, where the neural network architecture is simply replaced with a Transformer. This diminishes the originality of the contribution.\n\n2. **Empirical Evaluation:**\n   - The empirical evaluation is a significant weakness. The experiments are conducted solely on the SameGame, which is not a standard benchmark for evaluating reinforcement learning algorithms. This choice limits the generalizability and impact of the results.\n   - The comparisons are inadequate. The paper does not compare MCTransformer against a comprehensive set of baselines, including other MCTS-based methods with neural networks, or against other offline RL methods. This makes it difficult to assess the true effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\n3. **Clarity and Presentation:**\n   - The paper suffers from clarity issues, as noted by the reviewers. The exposition is unclear, and the figures and tables are not well-explained. This hinders the reader's ability to fully understand and evaluate the proposed method.\n   - There are several typographical and grammatical errors, which further detract from the paper's professionalism and readability.\n\n4. **Technical Correctness:**\n   - While the method appears to be technically sound, some claims are not well-supported by the empirical evidence provided. The lack of rigorous comparisons and the choice of a non-standard domain raise questions about the robustness and applicability of the results.\n\n5. **Reproducibility:**\n   - The paper does not provide source code, which is a significant drawback for reproducibility. Although the method is similar to existing frameworks, providing code would facilitate verification and further research.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nGiven the limited novelty, inadequate empirical evaluation, and issues with clarity and presentation, the paper does not meet the standards of a top-tier conference. The idea has potential, but substantial revisions and additional experiments are necessary to strengthen the contribution and demonstrate its significance.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

The authors propose splitting a neural network into two parts, with the client using the first part to encode data before sending it to the server for inference. The paper aims to maintain predictive performance while minimizing information leakage.\n\nUpon reviewing the comments from the three reviewers, several critical issues emerge:\n\n1. **Novelty and Incremental Contribution**: \n   - Reviewer 1 and Reviewer 2 both highlight that the idea of splitting a network for privacy is not novel and has been explored in prior work, such as split learning. The paper does not sufficiently differentiate itself from existing methods or provide a significant advancement over the state of the art.\n   - The paper's novelty is further questioned due to its lack of mention of related work in split learning, which is a significant oversight.\n\n2. **Technical Flaws and Threat Model**:\n   - Reviewer 2 points out severe flaws in the proposed approach, particularly regarding the threat model. The server's ability to reconstruct the encoder and the lack of defense against privacy leakage during training are significant issues. The assumption that the server will honestly implement the center loss is unrealistic in a curious server scenario.\n   - Reviewer 3 also questions the security model and the potential for information leakage through encoded features, especially in time-series data or NLP applications.\n\n3. **Experimental Evaluation**:\n   - The experimental evaluation is limited, as noted by Reviewer 1 and Reviewer 2. The paper only uses two datasets and compares against a minimal set of baselines. The choice of datasets and models is simplistic, and the evaluation lacks depth and breadth.\n   - Reviewer 2 suggests that more sophisticated architectures and challenging settings should be tested to demonstrate the method's effectiveness.\n\n4. **Clarity and Quality**:\n   - While the paper is generally clear, there are grammatical errors and ambiguous statements that affect its readability and the clarity of its contributions, as noted by Reviewer 1 and Reviewer 2.\n\n5. **Reproducibility**:\n   - Although the paper provides some hyperparameter settings, it lacks details on optimizers and training epochs, which are necessary for full reproducibility.\n\nOverall, the paper presents an idea that is not sufficiently novel or technically robust for a top-tier conference. The experimental evaluation is inadequate, and the paper does not convincingly address the privacy concerns it aims to solve.

The proposed method, FedPA, is innovative in its approach to use meta-learning for aggregation, which could potentially lead to better handling of non-iid data in FL.\n3. The paper includes experimental results that demonstrate the potential of FedPA to outperform conventional baselines in certain settings.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n1. **Lack of Theoretical and Experimental Justification:** The distinction between client drift and period drift is not well-supported theoretically or experimentally. This is a critical gap, as the concept of period drift is central to the paper's motivation.\n2. **Comparison with Related Work:** The paper does not adequately compare FedPA with similar methods, such as those based on knowledge distillation (e.g., FedET and DS-FL). This limits the ability to assess the novelty and effectiveness of the proposed method.\n3. **Experimental Limitations:** The experiments are conducted on relatively simple datasets and models, which may not convincingly demonstrate the method's effectiveness in more complex, real-world scenarios. The lack of results on more challenging datasets like CIFAR-100 and Stack Overflow is a significant limitation.\n4. **Proxy Dataset Assumption:** The reliance on a proxy dataset for training the aggregator is a strong assumption that may not be feasible in many practical FL scenarios, potentially limiting the applicability of the method.\n5. **Reproducibility and Clarity:** The paper lacks open-source code, which hinders reproducibility. Additionally, there are issues with clarity and writing quality, including grammatical errors and inconsistent citation formats.\n\n**Reviewer Consensus:**\nThe reviewers generally agree that while the paper presents an interesting idea, it lacks sufficient theoretical grounding, experimental validation, and clarity. The novelty of the contributions is also questioned, with some aspects overlapping with existing work. The paper's assumptions and experimental setup raise concerns about its applicability and robustness.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nGiven the significant weaknesses identified, particularly the lack of strong theoretical and experimental support for the proposed method, the reliance on a proxy dataset, and the insufficient comparison with related work, the paper does not meet the standards of a top-tier conference. The contributions, while potentially interesting, are not sufficiently novel or well-validated to warrant acceptance.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

The paper is evaluated based on several criteria, including clarity, novelty, technical correctness, and empirical validation.\n\n### Detailed Reasoning:\n\n1. **Clarity and Presentation:**\n   - Multiple reviewers have pointed out that the paper is poorly written, with significant issues in clarity and organization. The notation is heavy and not self-contained, requiring readers to be familiar with prior works to understand the content fully. This lack of clarity makes the paper difficult to follow, especially for those not already familiar with the specific literature.\n   - There are numerous grammatical errors and typos throughout the paper, which further detract from its readability and professionalism.\n\n2. **Technical Novelty and Significance:**\n   - The paper's contributions are seen as incremental rather than groundbreaking. The techniques used are heavily inspired by prior work, particularly the work of Semerjian et al. (2020) and Zhang et al. (2020). The novelty lies in the approximation used to compute phase transitions in the non-oracle setting, but this is not sufficiently highlighted or justified.\n   - The assumption of a known signal matrix in the oracle case is considered unrealistic, limiting the practical significance of the results.\n\n3. **Correctness and Support for Claims:**\n   - There are concerns about the correctness and support for some of the paper's claims. For instance, the claim of identifying precise phase transition thresholds is contradicted by the approximation methods used.\n   - The theoretical results are asymptotic, while the empirical results are for finite samples, leading to a mismatch between theory and practice.\n\n4. **Empirical Validation:**\n   - The empirical results are not well-aligned with the theoretical predictions, and the paper lacks sufficient numerical experiments to support its claims. The presentation of empirical results is also criticized for being unclear and not rigorous.\n\n5. **Reproducibility:**\n   - The paper does not provide code or sufficient details to ensure the reproducibility of its results, which is a significant drawback for a top-tier conference publication.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - While the paper addresses an interesting problem and provides some novel insights, the issues with clarity, technical rigor, and empirical validation are too significant to overlook.

This is a significant contribution as most existing methods focus on discrete action spaces.\n\n2. **Theoretical Foundation**: The paper is grounded in a solid theoretical framework, attempting to maximize mutual information to guide exploration.\n\n3. **Empirical Results**: The empirical evaluations on Mujoco environments show that MQES outperforms some state-of-the-art algorithms, indicating the potential effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n1. **Clarity and Presentation**: Multiple reviewers have pointed out that the paper is difficult to follow due to unclear explanations, especially regarding the parameterization of policies and the derivation of key equations. This lack of clarity hinders the reader's ability to fully understand and evaluate the proposed method.\n\n2. **Experimental Evaluation**: The experiments are criticized for being preliminary and lacking in detail. Important aspects such as hyperparameter settings and ablation studies are missing, which are crucial for assessing the robustness and generalizability of the method. Additionally, the choice of baselines is limited, and comparisons with more relevant methods like VIME are absent.\n\n3. **Impact of Hyperparameters**: The impact of hyperparameters on the performance of MQES is not thoroughly discussed or analyzed, which is a significant oversight given their potential influence on the results.\n\n4. **Significance of Results**: While the paper claims that MQES outperforms other methods, the improvements over DSAC are not substantial in many cases. The significance of these results is further questioned due to the limited number of seeds used in evaluations.\n\n5. **Conceptual Concerns**: There are concerns about the applicability of the method in sparse-reward settings, which are often the primary motivation for advanced exploration strategies.

The paper is evaluated in two games, Pong and Justice Online, and claims to improve the generalization of policies by ensuring diversity in playing styles.\n\n**Strengths:**\n1. **Novelty and Approach:** The paper introduces a bi-objective optimization model that is relatively novel in the context of reinforcement learning, particularly in maintaining diverse playing styles.\n2. **Clarity and Reproducibility:** The paper is generally well-written and provides sufficient details for reproducibility, as noted by the reviewers.\n3. **Empirical Results:** The results in the two games show that the proposed method can be competitive and, in some cases, outperform existing methods.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n1. **Literature and Baselines:** A significant weakness is the omission of relevant literature, particularly the work by Lanctot et al. (2017), which could provide a more comprehensive baseline for comparison. The lack of comparison with quality-diversity algorithms like MAP-Elites is also a notable gap.\n2. **Experimental Design:** The experimental setup, particularly the sampling of opponents, is criticized for potentially biasing results in favor of the proposed method. This raises concerns about the validity of the empirical findings.\n3. **Simplification of Playing Styles:** The reduction of playing styles to a single scalar is a simplification that may not capture the complexity of diverse strategies, as pointed out by Reviewer 2.\n4. **Limited Domains:** The evaluation is limited to only two games, one of which is relatively simple (Pong). This limits the generalizability of the findings to other complex domains.\n5. **Technical Novelty:** While the approach is novel, the technical contribution is considered incremental by some reviewers, particularly in the context of existing multi-objective optimization and quality-diversity literature.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\nThe paper presents an interesting approach to enhancing diversity in reinforcement learning through a bi-objective optimization model. However, the lack of comprehensive literature review, potential biases in experimental design, and limited evaluation domains weaken the paper's contributions. The simplification of playing styles and the absence of comparisons with established quality-diversity algorithms further detract from the paper's impact.\n\nGiven the standards of a top-tier conference, the paper falls short in addressing critical aspects of related work and providing robust empirical validation. While the idea is promising, the execution and presentation need significant improvements to meet the high standards expected.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

      "response": "The paper titled \"A Frequency Perspective of Adversarial Robustness\" presents an analysis of adversarial examples through the lens of frequency analysis, challenging the common misconception that adversarial examples are primarily high-frequency noise. The authors claim that adversarial examples are dataset dependent and propose a frequency-based explanation for the accuracy vs. robustness trade-off.\n\n**Strengths:**\n1. **Novel Perspective:** The paper provides a frequency-based perspective on adversarial examples, which is a valuable addition to the ongoing debate in the adversarial machine learning community.\n2. **Experimental Design:** The experiments are well-designed and provide interesting insights, particularly in sections 6.1 and 6.2, which are appreciated by multiple reviewers.\n3. **Clarity and Supplementary Material:** The paper is generally well-written and includes extensive supplementary material to support its claims.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n1. **Lack of Novelty:** Several reviewers point out that the main claim—that adversarial examples are dataset dependent—is already known in the literature. This reduces the novelty and significance of the contribution.\n2. **Insufficient Justification and Validation:** The paper's claims are not sufficiently justified or validated across a diverse set of datasets and attack methods. The focus on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-derived datasets is seen as limiting.\n3. **Overlapping Contributions:** The paper's findings overlap with existing literature, such as the work by Bernhard et al. (2021), which diminishes the paper's originality.\n4. **Clarity of Contributions:** Some reviewers find the contributions unclear and not well-highlighted, particularly regarding the practical implications of the proposed methods.\n5. **Limited Scope:** The paper primarily examines the frequency properties of adversarial perturbations for specific network architectures and does not consider other factors like different architectures or optimization properties.\n\n**Reviewer Consensus:**\nThe reviewers are divided, with some recommending acceptance due to the interesting insights and experimental design, while others recommend rejection due to the lack of novelty and insufficient justification of claims. The paper's contributions are seen as incremental rather than groundbreaking, which is a critical factor for acceptance in a top-tier conference.\n\n**Author Responses:**\nThe authors have attempted to address the reviewers' concerns, but several reviewers remain unconvinced about the novelty and significance of the contributions. The responses do not sufficiently clarify the unique contributions or address the overlap with existing work.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile the paper provides interesting insights and a novel perspective, the lack of significant novelty, insufficient validation, and overlap with existing literature are substantial drawbacks. For a top-tier conference, the contributions need to be more groundbreaking and well-validated across diverse scenarios. The paper would benefit from a major revision to address these issues and provide a clearer, more substantial contribution to the field.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

      "response": "The paper \"Functional Risk Minimization\" presents a novel framework for supervised learning by associating each data point with its own function, which is a departure from the traditional assumption of a single function with additive noise. The paper introduces Functional Risk Minimization (FRM) as a new learning objective and claims to provide better performance in small-scale experiments.\n\n### Strengths:\n1. **Novelty**: The idea of associating each data point with its own function is innovative and could potentially lead to new insights in handling noise and generalization in machine learning models.\n2. **Potential Impact**: If successful, this approach could extend the classical Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) framework and offer new ways to model data generation processes.\n3. **Empirical Results**: The paper provides empirical evidence that FRM can outperform ERM under certain noise conditions, which is promising.\n\n### Weaknesses:\n1. **Clarity and Presentation**: The paper suffers from clarity issues, particularly in distinguishing between the proposed FRM framework and existing concepts like hierarchical Bayesian models. The presentation of the FRM learning objective is not clear, and the connection between the theoretical framework and the implementable algorithm is not well-established.\n2. **Scalability**: The proposed algorithm appears to have scalability issues, as it relies on approximations and Hessian information that may not be feasible for large models. This limits the applicability of the approach to small-scale experiments.\n3. **Theoretical Justification**: There is a lack of formal theoretical arguments supporting the claims that FRM will outperform ERM. The paper does not provide sufficient evidence that the FRM minimizer will achieve low loss or that the finite-sample version approximates the population variant effectively.\n4. **Conceptual Confusion**: The paper's use of terminology, such as ERM and FRM, is non-standard and confusing. This could hinder the understanding and adoption of the proposed framework by the broader research community.\n\n### Reviewer Consensus:\n- **Reviewer 1** highlights significant issues with the clarity and theoretical grounding of the paper, suggesting that the paper is not ready for acceptance.\n- **Reviewer 2** acknowledges the novelty but points out conceptual confusions and the need for further explanation, particularly regarding the relationship with Bayesian models.\n- **Reviewer 3** is more favorable, noting the novelty and potential significance, but also mentions the high computational cost and the need for further discussion on the necessity of FRM over modified ERM.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile the paper presents an interesting and potentially impactful idea, the significant issues with clarity, scalability, and theoretical justification make it unsuitable for acceptance at a top-tier conference at this stage. The authors need to address these issues, particularly by providing a clearer presentation of the FRM framework, establishing stronger theoretical foundations, and demonstrating scalability to larger datasets.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

      "response": "The paper proposes a contrastive learning objective to address text degeneration issues in language models, specifically focusing on reducing repetition. While the idea is intuitive and the paper is well-written, several critical issues have been raised by the reviewers that need to be addressed to meet the standards of a top-tier conference.\n\n1. **Novelty and Contribution**: \n   - The novelty of the paper is questioned by all reviewers. The proposed method is seen as an incremental improvement over existing unlikelihood training methods. The core idea of penalizing previously generated tokens is not new, and the distinction made by the authors between their method and unlikelihood training is not convincingly demonstrated.\n   - Reviewer 1 points out that the authors misrepresent the unlikelihood training method, which already considers both positive and negative tokens. This misrepresentation undermines the claimed novelty of the proposed method.\n\n2. **Experimental Setup and Evaluation**:\n   - The experimental setup is considered insufficient by multiple reviewers. The experiments are conducted on a small-scale model (GPT2-small) and a limited dataset (wikitext-103), which does not convincingly demonstrate the method's effectiveness.\n   - The choice of metrics and the interpretation of results are also criticized. Perplexity is not a reliable metric for evaluating text generation quality, and the use of dist-1 instead of more comprehensive diversity metrics (dist-2, dist-3) is seen as a limitation.\n   - Reviewer 2 highlights the lack of comparison with crucial baselines and the need for experiments on larger models to establish the method's utility.\n\n3. **Significance and Impact**:\n   - The significance of the proposed method is questioned, especially in the context of larger and more advanced language models that may not suffer from the same degree of text degeneration.\n   - The human evaluation results do not show statistically significant improvements over existing methods, which further questions the practical impact of the proposed approach.\n\n4. **Reproducibility**:\n   - While the paper provides code and resources for reproducibility, the lack of novelty and insufficient experimental validation overshadow this positive aspect.\n\nIn conclusion, while the paper presents an interesting idea and is well-written, the lack of significant novelty, insufficient experimental validation, and questionable impact on state-of-the-art models make it unsuitable for acceptance at a top-tier conference. The authors need to address these issues, particularly by providing more comprehensive experiments and clearer differentiation from existing methods, to strengthen their contribution.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

      "response": "The paper \"Learning Sample Reweighting for Adversarial Robustness\" presents a novel approach to adversarial training by introducing a meta-learning framework that reweights training samples to improve robustness. The paper is well-written and the methodology is sound, leveraging a bilevel optimization inspired by MAML to learn a parametric function for sample reweighting. The authors provide extensive experimental results demonstrating improvements in both clean and robust accuracy over several baselines.\n\n**Strengths:**\n1. **Novelty in Approach:** The paper introduces a learning-based reweighting strategy for adversarial robustness, which is a departure from heuristic methods. This is a novel application of meta-learning techniques in the context of adversarial training.\n2. **Methodological Soundness:** The approach is methodologically sound, with a clear explanation of the bilevel optimization framework and its implementation.\n3. **Experimental Validation:** The paper includes comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets, using strong adversaries like AutoAttack, which support the claims of improved robustness.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n1. **Limited Technical Novelty:** Several reviewers pointed out that the technical novelty is limited, as the approach is a direct adaptation of existing meta-learning techniques (e.g., MAML) to adversarial training. This adaptation may not meet the high novelty bar of a top-tier conference.\n2. **Evaluation Concerns:** There are significant concerns about the evaluation, particularly the lack of adaptive attack evaluations, which are crucial for a fair assessment of adversarial robustness. The authors' response that such evaluations are beyond the scope of the paper is not convincing.\n3. **Performance Marginality:** The improvements in robust accuracy are described as marginal, and the method relies on combining with other techniques like TRADES to achieve competitive results. The lack of results on CIFAR-100 and the use of outdated datasets like MNIST are also noted.\n4. **Theoretical Justification:** The paper lacks a strong theoretical justification for the proposed multi-class margin and its superiority over other input encodings. This is a critical gap that several reviewers highlighted.\n\n**Reviewer Consensus:**\nThe reviewers are divided, with some recommending acceptance due to the empirical results and methodological soundness, while others recommend rejection due to the limited novelty, lack of adaptive attack evaluation, and marginal performance improvements. The concerns about the lack of theoretical justification and the need for more comprehensive ablation studies are also significant.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile the paper presents an interesting application of meta-learning to adversarial training and shows empirical improvements, the concerns about novelty, evaluation completeness, and theoretical justification are substantial. For a top-tier conference, these issues are critical and suggest that the paper is not yet ready for publication. The authors are encouraged to address these concerns, particularly by including adaptive attack evaluations and providing stronger theoretical insights, before resubmitting to a future venue.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

The authors claim that this approach leads to significant improvements in PPI prediction compared to sequence and network-based methods.\n\nUpon reviewing the comments from the four reviewers, several key points emerge:\n\n1. **Novelty and Contribution**: The primary concern across all reviews is the limited novelty and contribution of the paper. The method essentially combines existing techniques (OmegaFold embeddings and GNNs) without significant innovation or modification. The reviewers expected more original contributions, such as a novel pretraining method for protein structures, rather than the straightforward application of existing tools.\n\n2. **Empirical Evaluation**: The empirical results are criticized for being marginally better than existing methods and lacking robustness, as they do not include confidence intervals. Additionally, the choice of baselines is questioned, with reviewers noting the absence of comparisons to state-of-the-art methods like AlphaFold-Multimer or other advanced PPI prediction techniques.\n\n3. **Clarity and Presentation**: The paper's clarity is questioned, with specific issues in explaining the setup of the binary classification problem and the interpretation of results like AUC. The presentation of results in tables is also noted to be suboptimal, lacking confidence intervals and clear highlights of best results.\n\n4. **Technical and Empirical Significance**: The reviewers consistently rate the technical and empirical contributions as marginally significant or not significant at all. The paper does not convincingly demonstrate the advantage of using structural embeddings and GNN aggregation over simpler or more direct methods.\n\n5. **Reproducibility**: While the paper provides detailed hyper-parameter settings, the overall lack of clarity and the questionable choice of baselines may hinder reproducibility and the ability to assess the true impact of the proposed method.\n\nIn summary, while the paper addresses an important problem in bioinformatics, the approach lacks the novelty and empirical rigor expected at a top-tier conference. The combination of existing methods without significant innovation, coupled with unclear empirical advantages and presentation issues, suggests that the paper does not meet the standards required for acceptance.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

This extension allows for more expressive modeling of real-world problems.\n2. **Technical Soundness:** The paper is technically sound, with well-supported claims and a solid theoretical foundation. The use of weighted model integration and differentiation through a weighted model integral is innovative.\n3. **Clarity and Quality:** The paper is generally well-written, with clear explanations of the proposed methods and their significance.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n1. **Empirical Evaluation:** A recurring concern among reviewers is the limited empirical evaluation. The experiments are primarily conducted on toy applications, and there is a lack of extensive benchmarking against other methods. This raises questions about the generalizability and practical applicability of the proposed approach.\n2. **Incremental Nature:** Some reviewers perceive the work as an incremental improvement over DeepProbLog, rather than a groundbreaking innovation. This perception is partly due to the limited scope of experiments and the reliance on existing techniques.\n3. **Clarity on Discrete Variables:** There is some ambiguity regarding the handling of discrete variables, particularly in terms of reparameterization and integration. This could have been addressed more thoroughly in the paper.\n4. **Scalability and Efficiency:** Questions about the scalability and efficiency of the implementation remain unanswered. The trade-offs between performance and efficiency, especially when approximations are used, need further exploration.\n\n**Reviewer Consensus:**\nThe reviewers are divided in their opinions. While some appreciate the novelty and potential impact of the work, others are concerned about the limited empirical validation and the incremental nature of the contribution. The paper's strengths in theoretical innovation are somewhat overshadowed by the weaknesses in empirical demonstration and clarity.\n\n**Author Responses:**\nThe authors have provided clarifications and additional information in response to reviewer comments, but some concerns, particularly regarding empirical evaluation and clarity, persist.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile the paper presents a novel and technically sound contribution to the field of neural-symbolic AI, the limited empirical evaluation and perceived incremental nature of the work are significant drawbacks.
