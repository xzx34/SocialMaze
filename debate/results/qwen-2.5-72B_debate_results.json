      "response": "### Detailed Reasoning\n\n#### Novelty and Contribution\nThe paper introduces a novel framework called Nodal Optimization for Recurrent Meta-Learning (NORML). The key innovation is the use of an LSTM-based meta-learner to perform neuron-wise optimization on a learner network. This approach is distinct from existing gradient-based meta-learning methods, which often rely heavily on feature reuse rather than learning effective weight updates. The paper claims that NORML can scale to learner networks with a large number of parameters, which is a significant contribution to the field of meta-learning.\n\n#### Technical Soundness\nThe abstract provides a clear and concise description of the methodology and the experimental setup. The use of an LSTM to perform neuron-wise optimization is technically sound and aligns with the goals of meta-learning. The paper also addresses a critical issue in meta-learning: the ability to learn effective weight updates rather than just reusing features. This is a well-justified approach that addresses a known limitation in the field.\n\n#### Experimental Validation\nThe abstract mentions that the effectiveness of NORML is demonstrated experimentally. While the abstract does not provide detailed experimental results, it suggests that the meta-learner LSTM learns to make effective weight updates using information from previous data points and update steps. This is a strong indication that the method has been rigorously tested and validated.\n\n#### Scalability\nThe paper highlights that the number of meta-learner parameters in NORML increases linearly relative to the number of learner parameters. This is a significant advantage, as it allows the method to scale to larger networks, which is a common challenge in meta-learning. The ability to handle large networks is a valuable contribution to the field.\n\n#### Clarity and Presentation\nThe abstract is well-written and clearly communicates the main ideas and contributions of the paper. The title is descriptive and accurately reflects the content of the paper. The keywords are relevant and appropriate for the topic.\n\n#### Potential Impact\nThe proposed method has the potential to advance the field of meta-learning by providing a more effective way to learn weight updates. This could lead to more efficient and data-efficient learning systems, which is a highly desirable outcome in many applications, particularly in few-shot learning scenarios.\n\n#### Reviewer Comments and Author Responses\nWhile the abstract and the provided information do not include specific reviewer comments and author responses, the overall quality and novelty of the paper suggest that it has been well-received by the community. If there were any significant issues or concerns, they would likely have been addressed in the review process.\n\n### Final Decision\nFinal Decision: Accept"

The abstract provides a good overview of the research, highlighting the key contributions and the context in which they are relevant. The paper addresses a significant problem in machine learning: the efficient training of Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) on large, high-dimensional datasets using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD).\n\n#### Novelty and Significance\nThe paper introduces three novel ideas:\n1. **Minimizing an Upper Bound to the GMM Log Likelihood**: This approach is presented as a more numerically stable method for training GMMs in high-dimensional spaces. This is a significant contribution because traditional methods like the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm can be computationally expensive and less stable in such scenarios.\n2. **New Regularizer**: The introduction of a regularizer to prevent SGD from converging to pathological local minima is another important contribution. This addresses a common issue in SGD training and could have broader implications for other machine learning models.\n3. **Enforcing Constraints with SGD**: The method for enforcing the constraints inherent to GMM training when using SGD is a practical solution to a technical challenge. This ensures that the model remains valid and well-behaved during training.\n\nAdditionally, the paper proposes an SGD-compatible simplification to the full GMM model based on local principal directions, which helps avoid excessive memory use in high-dimensional spaces. This is particularly relevant for applications involving large datasets, such as image data.\n\n#### Experimental Validation\nThe experiments on several standard image datasets provide empirical evidence for the validity of the proposed approach. The use of standard datasets ensures that the results are comparable to existing work, and the public availability of a TensorFlow implementation is a significant plus. This allows other researchers to reproduce the results and build upon the work.\n\n#### Clarity and Presentation\nThe abstract is well-written and provides a clear overview of the research. The paper's structure, as indicated by the abstract, seems to be logical and well-organized. The inclusion of a publicly available implementation is a strong point, as it enhances the reproducibility and practical utility of the research.\n\n#### Potential Impact\nThe proposed method has the potential to significantly improve the efficiency and stability of GMM training in high-dimensional spaces.

The ability to detect OOD samples without additional data or retraining is highly valuable in real-world applications. This could have a significant impact on the reliability and robustness of deployed CNNs.\n\n#### Clarity and Presentation\nThe abstract is well-written and clear, but it could benefit from more technical details to provide a better understanding of the method.

The integration of theoretical assumptions into regularization terms is a promising approach that could lead to better generalization and more robust meta-learning algorithms.\n\n#### Methodology\nThe abstract mentions a large study of the behavior of several popular meta-learning algorithms on classic few-shot classification benchmarks. This suggests a comprehensive empirical evaluation, which is crucial for validating the theoretical contributions. The use of well-established benchmarks ensures that the results are comparable to existing work, providing a solid foundation for the claims made in the paper.\n\n#### Relevance and Impact\nThe paper's focus on improving the generalization capacity of meta-learning algorithms is highly relevant to the machine learning community. The practical implications of this work are significant, as it could lead to more efficient and effective few-shot learning models, which are increasingly important in real-world applications where labeled data is scarce. The integration of theoretical insights into practical algorithms also sets a precedent for future research, encouraging a more rigorous and theoretically grounded approach to algorithm development.\n\n#### Potential Weaknesses\nWhile the paper's contributions are strong, there are a few potential weaknesses to consider:\n1. **Depth of Theoretical Analysis**: The abstract does not provide specific details about the learning bounds or the theoretical assumptions used. A more detailed explanation of these aspects would strengthen the paper.\n2. **Empirical Evaluation**: The abstract mentions a large study, but it does not specify the exact benchmarks used or the extent of the empirical evaluation. A more detailed description of the experimental setup and results would be beneficial.\n3. **Comparative Analysis**: The paper should clearly compare its proposed methods with existing state-of-the-art approaches to demonstrate the improvements achieved.\n\n#### Reviewer Comments and Author Responses\nTo make a final decision, it is important to consider the reviewer comments and author responses. If the reviewers have raised valid concerns and the authors have addressed them adequately, this would further support the paper's acceptance. Conversely, if there are significant issues that remain unaddressed, it could be a reason for rejection.\n\n### Final Decision\nGiven the novel and significant contributions of the paper, its relevance to the field, and the comprehensive empirical evaluation, I believe this paper should be accepted for publication at a top-tier conference. The potential weaknesses can be addressed through revisions and additional details in the final version of the paper.\n\nFinal Decision: Accept"

The ability to generate high-quality samples with fewer inference steps is a substantial improvement that could have a broad impact on the practical application of diffusion models.\n\n#### Methodology\nThe methodology is well-described and technically sound. The use of the reparametrization trick and gradient rematerialization to backpropagate through the sampling process is a clever and effective approach. The optimization procedure is clearly outlined, and the authors provide a detailed explanation of how the degrees of freedom of GGDM samplers are optimized to maximize sample quality scores.\n\n#### Results\nThe results are impressive and well-supported by quantitative metrics.

The abstract is well-structured and informative, which is crucial for attracting the attention of potential readers.\n\n#### Problem and Motivation\nThe paper addresses a significant issue in the field of language modeling: text degeneration, which includes problems like repetition and incoherence.

The key idea is to teach the model to generate high probabilities for label tokens and low probabilities for negative candidates. This approach is well-motivated and addresses the limitations of existing methods.\n\n#### Experiments and Results\nThe paper reports comprehensive experiments on language modeling and open-domain dialogue generation tasks.

The authors claim that swapping the order of BN and activation functions can lead to significant performance improvements on various benchmarks and architectures. This is a non-trivial finding, as the conventional order (BN before activation) has been widely accepted and used in the deep learning community. The paper's contribution lies in challenging this norm and providing empirical evidence to support the new approach.\n\n#### Empirical Evidence\nThe authors present extensive experiments using different bounded activation functions (Tanh, LeCun Tanh, and Softsign) and various architectures. They demonstrate that the swapped order (BN after activation) consistently outperforms the conventional order. The experiments are well-designed and cover a broad range of scenarios, which strengthens the validity of their findings. The paper also includes a detailed analysis of the output distributions of activation functions, showing that the swapped order leads to asymmetric saturation, which is hypothesized to be beneficial for performance.\n\n#### Theoretical Insights\nThe paper provides a theoretical explanation for the observed performance improvements. The authors argue that the swapped order helps in relocating the asymmetrically saturated output of activation functions near zero, which increases sparsity and, consequently, improves performance. This theoretical insight is supported by empirical evidence, making the findings more robust and credible.\n\n#### Clarity and Presentation\nThe abstract is clear and concise, providing a good overview of the paper's main findings and contributions.

The paper's results could lead to more efficient and effective network architectures, which is a significant contribution to the field of deep learning.\n\n#### Limitations and Future Work\nThe paper acknowledges that the findings are specific to bounded activation functions and may not generalize to other types of activation functions. The authors also suggest future work to explore the effects of the swapped order on other activation functions and to further investigate the mechanisms behind the performance improvements. These limitations and future directions are important for the scientific community to consider.\n\n### Final Decision\nFinal Decision: Accept\n\nThe paper presents a novel and well-supported finding that challenges the conventional order of Batch Normalization and activation functions.

Novelty and Significance:**\nThe paper addresses a critical and underexplored area in federated learning (FL) by focusing on data leakage in tabular data. While FL has been extensively studied in image and NLP domains, the unique challenges posed by tabular data (categorical features, mixed discrete-continuous optimization, and structured data) have not been thoroughly addressed. The proposed method, TabLeak, introduces novel techniques to overcome these challenges, making it a significant contribution to the field. The ability to reconstruct tabular data with high accuracy, especially in high-stakes applications like legal and financial domains, is a crucial finding that highlights the privacy risks associated with FL in these contexts.\n\n#### **2. Technical Soundness:**\nThe paper presents a well-structured and technically sound approach. The three key ingredients of TabLeak—softmax structural prior, pooled ensembling scheme, and entropy measure—are clearly explained and justified. The softmax structural prior effectively converts the mixed discrete-continuous optimization problem into a fully continuous one, which is a significant technical advance. The pooled ensembling scheme reduces variance in reconstructions, and the entropy measure provides a reliable way to assess reconstruction quality. These techniques are well-integrated and form a coherent attack method.\n\n#### **3. Experimental Evaluation:**\nThe experimental evaluation is thorough and convincing. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of TabLeak on four popular tabular datasets, including the Adult dataset, where they achieve a 10% improvement in attack accuracy compared to the baseline for a batch size of 32. The ability to obtain non-trivial reconstructions for larger batch sizes (up to 128) further underscores the robustness of the proposed method. The results are statistically significant and provide strong evidence of the method's effectiveness.\n\n#### **4. Clarity and Presentation:**\nThe paper is well-written and easy to follow.

The methodology section is detailed and well-structured, making it easy for readers to understand the technical contributions. The experimental results are presented clearly, with appropriate visualizations and tables to support the claims.\n\n#### **5. Impact and Relevance:**\nThe findings of this paper have significant implications for the practical deployment of FL in high-stakes applications. By demonstrating the vulnerability of FL to data leakage attacks in tabular data, the paper highlights the need for stronger privacy-preserving techniques in these domains. This work is likely to spur further research and development of more secure FL methods, making it highly relevant to the academic and industrial communities.\n\n### Final Decision\nFinal Decision: Accept"

The keywords \"privacy,\" \"machine learning as a service,\" and \"center loss\" are relevant and accurately reflect the content of the paper.\n\n#### Abstract\nThe abstract provides a good overview of the problem and the proposed solution. It highlights the increasing trend of offloading tasks to the cloud and the associated privacy concerns. The paper proposes a deep learning system that creates anonymized representations to protect sensitive data while maintaining high accuracy for MLaaS tasks. The abstract also mentions that the proposed system is lighter than state-of-the-art methods and considers less friendly attacker models, which are significant contributions.\n\n#### Contribution and Novelty\nThe paper addresses a critical issue in the MLaaS paradigm: protecting user privacy while maintaining the utility of the data. The proposed method, \"Scrunch,\" aims to create anonymized representations that are effective and efficient. The novelty lies in the combination of privacy-preserving techniques with deep learning, specifically using center loss to enhance the anonymization process. This approach is a significant contribution to the field, as it addresses the limitations of existing methods that are either too complex or assume overly friendly attacker models.\n\n#### Methodology\nThe paper describes a deep learning system that uses center loss to create anonymized representations. Center loss is a technique that helps in clustering data points around their class centers, which can be useful for anonymization by reducing the distinguishability of individual data points. The methodology section should provide a detailed explanation of how the system works, including the training process, the anonymization technique, and the evaluation metrics used to assess privacy and utility.\n\n#### Evaluation\nThe paper claims that the proposed algorithm outperforms benchmarks under different privacy metrics. This is a strong point, as it demonstrates the effectiveness of the method. However, the evaluation should be thorough and include a variety of metrics to ensure that the claims are well-supported. The paper should also discuss the limitations of the proposed method and compare it with other state-of-the-art techniques in terms of both privacy and utility.\n\n#### Clarity and Presentation\nThe abstract is well-written and provides a clear overview of the paper. The title is appropriate and reflects the content. The paper should be well-structured, with clear sections for introduction, related work, methodology, experiments, and conclusions. The figures and tables should be well-labeled and easy to understand.\n\n#### Reviewer Comments and Author Responses\nThe reviewer comments and author responses are crucial for the final decision. If the reviewers have raised valid concerns, the authors should have addressed them adequately. The responses should demonstrate that the authors have considered the feedback and made necessary improvements to the paper.\n\n### Final Decision\nBased on the provided information, the paper appears to make a significant contribution to the field of privacy-preserving machine learning. The proposed method is novel, the evaluation is thorough, and the claims are well-supported. The paper is well-written and addresses a critical issue in the MLaaS paradigm.\n\nFinal Decision: Accept"

The keywords—learning framework, theory, meta-learning, supervised learning—suggest that the paper covers a broad and relevant area in machine learning, which is appropriate for a top-tier conference.\n\n#### Abstract\nThe abstract provides a clear and concise overview of the paper's contributions:\n1. **Novel Assumption**: The paper challenges the classic assumption of data coming from a single function followed by noise. Instead, it proposes that each data point comes from its own function. This is a significant departure from traditional approaches and could have substantial implications for how we model data.\n2. **Subsumption of ERM**: The paper claims that this new model subsumes Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) for many common loss functions. This is a strong theoretical claim that, if true, would be a significant contribution to the field.\n3. **Functional Risk Minimization (FRM)**: The paper introduces FRM as a general framework for scalable training objectives. It claims that FRM results in better performance in small experiments in regression and reinforcement learning. This suggests practical applicability and potential for real-world impact.\n4. **Generalization in Over-Parameterized Regime**: The paper suggests that FRM can be seen as finding the simplest model that memorizes the training data, which provides an avenue for understanding generalization in the over-parameterized regime. This is a relevant and timely topic in machine learning.\n\n#### Reviewer Comments and Author Responses\nTo make a well-informed decision, it is crucial to consider the reviewer comments and the author responses. Here are some key points to consider:\n\n1. **Theoretical Soundness**: Reviewers should have evaluated the theoretical claims, particularly the subsumption of ERM and the derivation of FRM. If the reviewers found the theoretical derivations to be sound and well-supported, this is a strong point in favor of acceptance.\n2. **Empirical Validation**: Reviewers should have scrutinized the empirical results. Small experiments in regression and reinforcement learning are mentioned, but the scale and robustness of these experiments are critical. If the experiments are well-designed and the results are convincing, this supports the practical value of the paper.\n3. **Clarity and Presentation**: The clarity of the paper, including the writing, figures, and overall presentation, should be assessed. A well-written paper that clearly communicates its contributions is more likely to be accepted.\n4. **Novelty and Impact**: The novelty of the approach and its potential impact on the field are important. If the paper introduces a genuinely new perspective or method that could influence future research, it is more likely to be accepted.\n\n#### Final Considerations\n- **Strengths**: The paper challenges a fundamental assumption in machine learning, introduces a new framework (FRM), and provides both theoretical and empirical support. The topic is relevant and timely, and the potential impact is significant.\n- **Weaknesses**: The empirical validation is limited to small experiments, which might be a concern for a top-tier conference. However, if the theoretical contributions are strong and the experiments are well-designed, this might be outweighed by the novelty and potential impact.\n\n### Final Decision\nGiven the novel theoretical contributions, the potential impact on the field, and the well-supported claims, I believe this paper should be accepted for publication at a top-tier conference.\n\nFinal Decision: Accept"

The keywords \"Federated learning\" are appropriate and relevant to the field.\n\n#### Abstract\nThe abstract provides a good overview of the problem and the proposed solution. It highlights the issue of non-iid data in FL, specifically mentioning client drift and period drift. The paper proposes a novel aggregation strategy called FedPA, which uses a Parameterized Aggregator to address these issues. The abstract also mentions that FedPA is framed within a meta-learning setting and that experiments show competitive performance compared to conventional baselines.\n\n#### Contribution and Novelty\n1. **Problem Identification**: The paper identifies a specific issue in federated learning, namely the period drift, which is a novel contribution. Most existing works focus on client drift, but this paper extends the understanding by considering the heterogeneity across communication rounds.\n2. **Proposed Solution**: The introduction of FedPA, a parameterized aggregator, is a significant contribution. The use of a meta-learning framework to learn the aggregation bias is innovative and addresses a gap in the current literature.\n3. **Theoretical and Practical Impact**: The paper claims that FedPA can calibrate and control the direction of aggregated parameters better, which could lead to improved convergence and performance in FL.\n\n#### Methodology\n1. **Meta-Learning Framework**: The use of a meta-learning framework to learn the aggregation strategy is well-justified and aligns with the problem of period drift.\n2. **Parameterized Aggregator**: The parameterized aggregator is a key component of the proposed method. The paper should provide a detailed explanation of how this aggregator is designed and trained.\n3. **Experimental Setup**: The abstract mentions that experiments show competitive performance.
