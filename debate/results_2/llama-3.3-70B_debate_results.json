      "response": "The paper \"SGD Learns One-Layer Networks in WGANs\" presents an analysis of the convergence of stochastic gradient descent-ascent for training Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks (WGANs) with a one-layer generator network and simple discriminators (linear and quadratic). The authors provide theoretical results showing that, under certain conditions, stochastic gradient descent-ascent can learn the target distribution in polynomial time and sample complexity.\n\nHowever, the reviewers have raised several concerns that need to be addressed:\n\n1. **Simplistic discriminators**: All reviewers agree that the use of linear and quadratic discriminators is overly simplistic and does not capture the true nature of WGAN training, which typically involves more complex neural networks. This simplification may not be representative of real-world WGAN training scenarios.\n2. **Limited applicability**: The results obtained in the paper may not be easily extendable to more complex discriminators or generators, which is a significant limitation. The analysis relies heavily on the simplicity of the discriminators, and it is unclear how the results would generalize to more realistic settings.\n3. **Misleading claims**: Some reviewers feel that the paper's title and claims are misleading, as the results are specific to very simple discriminators and generators, which may not be representative of the broader WGAN literature.\n4. **Lack of experimental validation**: While the paper provides some experimental results, they are not comprehensive, and more experiments are needed to validate the theoretical findings, especially in more realistic settings.\n\nDespite these concerns, the paper does make some contributions to the understanding of WGAN training, particularly in the context of simple discriminators and generators. The theoretical analysis is well-done, and the results provide insight into the convergence of stochastic gradient descent-ascent in these simplified settings.\n\nHowever, considering the top-tier conference standards, the paper's limitations and simplifications may not be sufficient to warrant acceptance. The conference typically expects papers to present more significant, generalizable, and impactful results that advance the state-of-the-art in the field.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

      "response": "The paper \"NORML: Nodal Optimization for Recurrent Meta-Learning\" proposes a novel meta-learning framework that utilizes an LSTM-based meta-learner to perform neuron-wise optimization on a learner for efficient task learning. The paper's main contribution is the introduction of a meta-learner that can scale to learner networks with a large number of parameters.\n\nHowever, upon analyzing the reviewer comments, several concerns and issues with the paper are raised. Reviewer 1 points out that the paper's comparison to previous work, specifically Ravi & Larochelle, is inaccurate. The reviewer argues that Ravi & Larochelle's approach does not require an enormous number of parameters, contrary to the paper's claim. Reviewer 1 also questions the paper's experimental results, stating that the results are not convincing and that the authors' claims about the benefits of their approach are not supported.\n\nReviewer 2 criticizes the paper's writing style, stating that it is beyond the level required by a scientific manuscript and contains numerous grammatical mistakes. The reviewer also questions the paper's technical novelty, stating that it is minimal.\n\nReviewer 3 raises several concerns, including the limited novelty of the paper, missing baselines, and limited applicability. The reviewer argues that the paper's approach is a fairly incremental variation compared to previous work and that the authors do not provide a fair comparison with other methods. The reviewer also points out that the paper's assumptions about the base learner being a fully connected network limit the applicability of the method.\n\nIn addition to these concerns, the reviewers also point out several minor issues, including inaccuracies in the description of previous work, missing references, and formatting errors.\n\nGiven the numerous concerns and issues raised by the reviewers, it is clear that the paper requires significant revisions to address these issues. The paper's limited novelty, missing baselines, and limited applicability are major concerns that need to be addressed. Additionally, the paper's writing style and formatting need to be improved to meet the standards of a top-tier conference.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

The authors propose a method to incrementally learn independent hierarchical representations from high- to low-levels of abstractions, which improves disentanglement in comparison to existing works.\n\nThe paper is well-motivated, and the results look impressive, with the learned hierarchy and latent traversals being convincing. The authors introduce a new metric, MIG-sup, to capture the one-to-one mapping of the ground truth factors to the latent dimensions, which is a valuable contribution to the field.\n\nHowever, the reviewers have raised several concerns that need to be addressed. Reviewer 1 suggests adding an experiment to compare mutual information of each layer with VLAE, which the authors have addressed in their rebuttal. Reviewer 2 has several concerns, including the lack of clarity in the purpose of the paper, the relationship between hierarchical representation and disentangled representation, and the similarity to existing work. The authors have addressed these concerns in their rebuttal, and Reviewer 2 has increased their score to a Weak Accept.\n\nReviewer 3 finds the idea fresh and well-explained, with sufficiently thorough experiments. They suggest adding quantitative experiments on information flow and formalizing the concept of \"z from different abstraction\". Reviewer 4 finds the paper well-motivated and easy to read, with impressive results. They suggest adding ablation studies to compare the effect of incremental learning and fade-out.\n\nAfter carefully considering the reviewers' comments and the authors' rebuttal, I believe that the paper has addressed the major concerns raised by the reviewers. The authors have provided additional experiments and clarifications, which have improved the paper's quality and addressed the reviewers' concerns.\n\nThe paper's contributions, including the novel approach to learning hierarchical representations and the introduction of the MIG-sup metric, are significant and valuable to the field. The results are impressive, and the learned hierarchy and latent traversals are convincing.\n\nTherefore, based on the analysis of the paper and the reviewers' comments, I conclude that the paper should be accepted for publication.\n\nFinal Decision: Accept"

      "response": "The research paper in question has been evaluated based on the provided title, abstract, reviewer comments, and author responses. The analysis of these components reveals several critical issues that significantly impact the paper's suitability for publication in a top-tier conference.\n\n1. **Lack of Clarity and Poor Writing**: All three reviewers have highlighted the poor writing quality of the paper, noting grammatical issues, incomprehensible passages, and an overall lack of clarity. This makes it extremely difficult for reviewers to understand the paper's contributions, methodology, and conclusions. Clear and professional writing is essential for academic communication, and the paper's current state falls short of these standards.\n\n2. **Absence of References**: The paper does not cite any previous research, which is a fundamental aspect of academic writing. References are crucial for situating the research within the broader context of the field, acknowledging prior work, and demonstrating how the current research contributes to the existing body of knowledge. The lack of references suggests a disconnect from the academic community and the field's literature.\n\n3. **Methodological and Conceptual Issues**: Reviewers have struggled to discern the paper's methodology and the specific improvements it proposes to Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) agents. The abstract's mention of focusing on the \"coordination of episode generation\" is unclear, and without a detailed explanation of the approach and its novelty, it's challenging to assess the paper's contributions.\n\n4. **Insufficient Evidence and Analysis**: While the abstract mentions experiments with a small problem showing \"robust performance\" compared to Alpha Zero, there is no detailed analysis or presentation of results that would allow for an evaluation of these claims. In academic research, especially in a top-tier conference, it is essential to provide comprehensive evidence and analysis to support any assertions of improvement or innovation.\n\n5. **Professionalism and Academic Standards**: The reviewers' comments collectively suggest that the paper does not meet basic standards of academic professionalism and rigor. The inclusion of undefined mathematical symbols, difficult-to-follow algorithm boxes, and the overall structure of the paper contribute to this assessment.\n\nGiven these considerations, the paper in its current form does not meet the standards expected for publication in a top-tier conference. The issues identified are fundamental and would require significant revisions to address. While the idea of refining MCTS agents using MCTS itself is potentially interesting, the execution and presentation of this idea in the paper are severely lacking.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

      "response": "The paper \"Effect of Activation Functions on the Training of Overparametrized Neural Nets\" presents a theoretical analysis of how different activation functions impact the training of overparametrized neural networks. The authors provide a comprehensive study that separates activation functions into two cases: non-smooth activations (e.g., ReLU, SELU, ELU) and smooth activations (e.g., tanh, swish, polynomial). They show that non-smooth activations have large minimum eigenvalues of the associated Gram matrix, leading to faster training, whereas smooth activations can have small minimum eigenvalues, resulting in slower training, especially when the data has a low-dimensional structure.\n\nThe strengths of the paper include:\n\n1. **Theoretical contributions**: The paper provides novel theoretical results that advance our understanding of the impact of activation functions on the training of overparametrized neural networks.\n2. **Comprehensive analysis**: The authors consider a wide range of activation functions and provide a detailed analysis of their properties and how they affect the training process.\n3. **Empirical validation**: The paper includes empirical experiments that validate the theoretical findings, demonstrating the practical relevance of the results.\n4. **Well-organized and self-contained**: The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise presentation of their results, making it easy to follow.\n\nHowever, there are also some weaknesses and areas for improvement:\n\n1. **Length and organization**: The paper is lengthy, and the appendix is extensive. While the authors provide a proof sketch of the main results, some reviewers found it challenging to navigate the paper and suggested reorganizing the appendix to emphasize the main techniques and ideas.\n2. **Clarity and notation**: Some reviewers pointed out minor issues with notation and clarity, such as the explanation of the M matrix and the wording of certain statements.\n3. **References and context**: The paper could benefit from more context and references to related work, particularly in the introduction and discussion sections.\n\nAfter carefully considering the reviewer comments and the paper's content, I conclude that the paper's strengths outweigh its weaknesses. The theoretical contributions, comprehensive analysis, and empirical validation demonstrate the paper's significance and relevance to the field.\n\nAddressing the reviewer comments and suggestions will further improve the paper's clarity, organization, and overall quality. The authors should consider reorganizing the appendix, providing more context and references, and addressing minor issues with notation and clarity.\n\nFinal Decision: Accept"

      "response": "The paper \"Differentiable Hebbian Consolidation for Continual Learning\" proposes a novel approach to address the problem of catastrophic forgetting in neural networks. The method, called Differentiable Hebbian Consolidation, combines a Differentiable Hebbian Plasticity (DHP) Softmax layer with task-specific synaptic consolidation methods to retain learned representations over a longer timescale.\n\nThe paper is well-written, and the method is well-motivated by cognitive principles and neurobiological substrates. The authors provide a clear explanation of the proposed approach and demonstrate its effectiveness on several benchmarks, including Permuted MNIST, Split MNIST, and Vision Datasets Mixture. The results show that the proposed method outperforms comparable baselines and reduces forgetting.\n\nHowever, the reviewer comments raise several concerns that need to be addressed. Reviewer 1 suggests that the empirical evaluation is not strong enough, and the results on Split CIFAR-10/100 are not convincing. Reviewer 2 has trouble following the details of the DHP Softmax and suggests that a figure and equations for the standard Softmax would be helpful. Reviewer 3 points out that the experimental section is limited and suggests that the authors should compare their method to other CLS-based approaches and try more experiments on different datasets. Reviewer 4 considers the results on simpler continual learning settings to be weak and suggests that the authors should evaluate their method on more challenging datasets.\n\nDespite these concerns, the paper has several strengths. The proposed method is simple, easy to implement, and does not require additional hyperparameters. The authors demonstrate the flexibility of their method by integrating it with well-known task-specific synaptic consolidation methods. The results show significant improvements over simple baselines, and the method can complement other task-specific Hebbian-based learning paradigms.\n\nTo address the concerns raised by the reviewers, the authors could provide additional experiments on more challenging datasets, such as CIFAR-100 or ILSVRC, and compare their method to other CLS-based approaches. They could also provide more details on the DHP Softmax, including equations and figures, to make the paper more accessible to readers who are not familiar with Hebbian learning.\n\nIn conclusion, while the paper has several strengths, the concerns raised by the reviewers need to be addressed. The authors should provide additional experiments and comparisons to other methods to demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of their approach.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

The authors propose an adversarial sampling mechanism that generates negative samples from an auxiliary model, which mimics the data distribution, to enhance the gradient signal and reduce the computational cost.\n\nThe paper has several strengths. Firstly, the proposed approach is technically sound and well-motivated. The authors provide a clear explanation of the problem, the proposed solution, and the theoretical foundations of their method. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in reducing the training time and improving the convergence rate compared to several competitive baselines.\n\nHowever, the paper also has some weaknesses. One of the main concerns is the lack of comprehensive comparison with existing state-of-the-art methods. Reviewer 2 points out that the authors gloss over many relevant prior works and fail to put their results in the right context. Specifically, the authors do not compare their approach with recent methods such as Slice, Adaptive Sampled Softmax, and Sampled Softmax with Random Fourier Features, which also address the problem of efficient softmax approximation.\n\nReviewer 3 raises several concerns about the experimental evaluation, including the lack of comparison with recent state-of-the-art methods, the omission of important baselines such as DiSMEC, and the limited evaluation on only two datasets. The reviewer also suggests that the authors should investigate the performance of their approach on more datasets, including smaller ones, and evaluate its extension to the multi-label setting.\n\nAdditionally, Reviewer 2 and Reviewer 3 point out several minor errors and typos in the paper, which should be corrected.\n\nIn conclusion, while the paper presents a novel and technically sound approach to extreme classification, the lack of comprehensive comparison with existing state-of-the-art methods and the limited experimental evaluation are significant weaknesses.

The authors propose using a bidirectional LSTM RNN model, which outperforms other traditional machine learning models. However, after carefully analyzing the paper, reviewer comments, and author responses, several concerns and limitations have been identified.\n\nFirstly, the paper lacks methodological novelty, as pointed out by Reviewer 3. The use of bidirectional LSTM RNNs for predicting DNA folding patterns is not a new concept, and the paper does not provide significant improvements or new insights. The authors do not clearly explain how their approach differs from previously published works, which is a major concern.\n\nSecondly, the description of the data and methods is not clear enough. Reviewer 3 points out that it is unclear which features were used as inputs, how they were represented, and how genomic segments of different chromosomes were treated. This lack of clarity makes it difficult to understand and reproduce the results.\n\nThirdly, the evaluation of the models is limited. Reviewer 1 suggests that the improvement in performance may be due to the proposed new metric, rather than the LSTM model itself. Reviewer 3 also points out that the authors should use the same loss function for training all models and use additional evaluation metrics such as MSE and R^2 score.\n\nFourthly, the paper lacks generalizability. Reviewer 1 points out that the approach is specific to Hi-C data and ChIP-seq features, and it is unclear if it can be applied to other datasets or features. The authors do not provide any evidence that their approach can be generalized to other organisms or datasets.\n\nLastly, there are several technical issues with the paper. Reviewer 2 points out that there is only one equation in the paper, and it is not clearly explained. Reviewer 3 suggests that the authors should compare recurrent models to non-recurrent models and use additional evaluation metrics.\n\nConsidering these concerns and limitations, it is clear that the paper requires significant revisions and improvements before it can be considered for publication in a top-tier conference.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

The proposed framework aims to address this limitation by modeling task dependencies at multiple levels.\n\nThe reviewers' comments highlight several strengths and weaknesses of the paper.

However, they point out that the paper does not experiment with different amounts of computation per domain, which is a key intuition behind the method. They also suggest that the paper should report state-of-the-art performance for domain adaptation methods and provide more discussion on the experimental study.\n\nReviewer 3 appreciates the novelty of the idea but finds the experimental support to be insufficient.

The paper presents qualitative results demonstrating the model's abilities for disentanglement, compositionality, and generalization.\n\nHowever, the reviewers have raised several concerns that need to be addressed. Reviewer 1 points out that the paper is poorly written, with many typos and grammatical errors. The reviewer also questions the claim that ROOTS is the first unsupervised model to identify objects in a 3D scene, citing existing work such as MONet and Iodine. Additionally, the reviewer requests clarification on several aspects of the model, including the notation, the scene volume map, and the use of a Gaussian distribution for the position.\n\nReviewer 2 also raises concerns about the paper's clarity and the lack of proper citations. The reviewer points out that the paper ignores existing work on 3D representation learning and neural rendering, and that the experiments are not thorough enough. The reviewer suggests that the paper would benefit from additional comparisons to other methods, such as CGQN, and more detailed analysis of the results.\n\nReviewer 3 raises similar concerns, pointing out that the paper lacks proper citations and comparisons to existing work. The reviewer also questions the novelty of the proposed method, citing existing work on 3D representation learning and object-oriented scene understanding.\n\nReviewer 4 raises concerns about the paper's complexity and the lack of clear explanations. The reviewer points out that the method is difficult to follow, and that the notation and terminology are not consistent. The reviewer also questions the experimental results, pointing out that the comparisons to GQN are not thorough enough and that the results are not significant.\n\nIn the post-rebuttal update, the reviewers continue to raise concerns about the paper's clarity, experimental results, and comparisons to existing work. The authors have addressed some of the concerns, but the reviewers still feel that the paper is not ready for publication.\n\nBased on the reviews, it is clear that the paper has several major issues that need to be addressed. The paper's poor writing, lack of clarity, and insufficient comparisons to existing work are significant concerns. Additionally, the experimental results are not thorough enough, and the reviewers have raised questions about the novelty and significance of the proposed method.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that the paper is not ready for publication in its current form.

The training strategy, named MuPPET, combines the use of multiple number representation regimes together with a precision-switching mechanism that decides at run-time the transition between different precisions.\n\nThe reviewers have raised several concerns and criticisms about the paper. Reviewer 1 finds the paper interesting but feels that the reasoning behind the algorithm is not well-presented and that the motivation behind the switching mechanism is unclear. Reviewer 2 points out that the proposed approach does not match the description in the paper and that the setting of quantized precision levels is confusing. Reviewer 3 recommends a weak reject, stating that the core idea of the manuscript, i.e., the dynamic switching between precision levels, is not shown to be a necessary condition for good classification results.\n\nAfter carefully analyzing the paper and the reviewer comments, several major issues are evident:\n\n1. **Lack of clarity and motivation**: The paper lacks a clear and detailed presentation of the reasoning behind the algorithm, and the motivation behind the switching mechanism is not well-explained. This makes it difficult for readers to understand the underlying principles of MuPPET.\n2. **Confusing presentation**: The presentation of the precision switching policy is confusing, and the notations are unclear. This makes it challenging to reproduce the results and understand the methodology.\n3. **Insufficient evaluation**: The paper does not provide a thorough evaluation of the proposed approach, and the results are not superior enough compared to state-of-the-art methods. The training and validation curves are not shown, which makes it difficult to analyze the training process.\n4. **Methodological issues**: The paper raises several methodological concerns, such as the choice of quantized precision levels, the determination of scaling factors, and the difference between n and WL.\n\nDespite the novelty of the proposed approach, the paper requires significant revisions to address the concerns and criticisms raised by the reviewers.

The authors compare the performance of a bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model with other classical machine learning approaches, including linear models with regularization and Gradient Boosting. The results show that the LSTM model outperforms the other methods, and the authors attribute this to the model's ability to capture the sequential dependencies in the DNA data.\n\nHowever, upon careful analysis of the paper and the reviewer comments, several concerns and limitations are raised. Reviewer 1 points out that the improvement in performance may be due to the proposed weighted mean squared error (wMSE) metric rather than the LSTM model itself. They also question the generalizability of the approach to other Hi-C datasets and epigenetic features. Reviewer 2 raises several minor issues with the paper, including the lack of clarity in the equation, the need for formalization of certain sentences, and the absence of a discussion on why regression is better or worse than a neural network in this application setting.\n\nReviewer 3 provides more significant criticisms, including the lack of methodological novelty, unclear description of the data and methods, and the need for additional baseline models and evaluation metrics. They also point out that the paper is similar to previously published works, which are not cited. The reviewer questions the choice of a bidirectional LSTM and its motivation, as well as the use of the weighted MSE as the evaluation metric.\n\nConsidering these concerns and limitations, the paper has several major issues that need to be addressed.

The authors claim that their method can learn reusable skills from a collection of human demonstrations without requiring explicit segmentation or ordering of primitives.\n\nHowever, after carefully analyzing the paper, reviewer comments, and author responses, I have identified several concerns that raise doubts about the paper's validity and significance.\n\nFirstly, Reviewer 1 points out that the paper's framing and motivation do not correspond to the results and experiments reported. The paper is framed as a way to learn reusable sub-skills that can help generalize to new situations in control, but the method presented only provides a per-time-step labeling of each observation with the associated most likely sub-skill. This limitation is significant, as it does not provide any indication that the data could be useful for learning reusable skills for downstream tasks later.\n\nSecondly, the experimental results are limited in scope and do not provide enough evidence to support the claims made in the paper. Reviewer 1 suggests that the paper should include more experiments, such as training a behavior cloning (BC) agent on the observation-action pairs conditioned on the sub-skill, to demonstrate the usefulness of the learned skills. Reviewer 2 also points out that the results are underwhelming, with validation accuracy ranging from 35-60%, and that the paper lacks a comparison to a fully-supervised oracle method.\n\nThirdly, the paper lacks clarity and transparency in its experimental setup and results. Reviewer 1 points out that the details regarding the task setup, number of demonstrations needed per task/skill, architectural choices, and hyper-parameters are lacking, making it hard to follow and understand the experiments. Reviewer 3 also suggests that the paper should provide more analysis regarding the segmented trajectories, such as confusion matrices or precision and recall metrics, to assess the quality of the learned skills.\n\nLastly, the paper's novelty and contributions are questioned by Reviewer 2, who points out that the log-sum-exp pooling approach has been used successfully in other domains and that the results are not impressive enough to warrant publication in a top-tier conference.\n\nIn conclusion, while the paper proposes an interesting approach to weakly-supervised trajectory segmentation, the limitations and concerns raised by the reviewers significantly outweigh the paper's contributions. The paper lacks clarity, transparency, and convincing evidence to support its claims, and the experimental results are limited in scope and significance.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

The authors propose three key ideas: minimizing an upper bound to the GMM log likelihood, introducing a new regularizer to prevent convergence to pathological local minima, and enforcing constraints inherent to GMM training when using SGD. They also propose an SGD-compatible simplification to the full GMM model based on local principal directions.\n\nThe reviewers have raised several concerns and criticisms about the paper. Reviewer 1 feels that the work is largely incremental and that the authors lack understanding of the history of online EM. They also criticize the max-component approximation, the representation of multinoulli in terms of its natural parameters, and the smoothing approach. Reviewer 1 is concerned about the experimental evaluation, particularly the choice of datasets and the lack of comparison to other methods.\n\nReviewer 2 shares similar concerns, questioning the novelty and significance of the proposed method. They point out the lack of guarantees for convergence and the unclear motivation for the maximization in eq. (2). Reviewer 2 also criticizes the requirement for the covariance matrix, the expression for τ, and the local principal directions covariance structure.\n\nReviewer 3 finds the paper to be clear and well-written but raises concerns about the limited contribution of the max-component trick and the mysterious motivation for smoothing on the 2D grid. They also question the practical advantages of the method compared to standard EM and the lack of comparison to other baselines.\n\nDespite these criticisms, the paper has some strengths. The authors have proposed a novel approach for training GMMs using SGD, which could be useful for large-scale datasets. The experimental results show promising performance on standard image datasets. The paper is also well-organized and easy to follow.\n\nHowever, after careful consideration of the reviewers' comments and the paper's content, I believe that the paper has several major weaknesses that cannot be overlooked. The lack of novelty and significance, the unclear motivation for some of the proposed methods, and the limited experimental evaluation are significant concerns. Additionally, the paper does not provide sufficient comparison to other baselines, and the practical advantages of the method are not clearly demonstrated.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided information and the standards of a top-tier conference, I conclude that the paper requires significant revisions to address the concerns raised by the reviewers.

This contribution is novel and addresses a significant problem in the field of adversarial robustness.\n\n2. **Technical Soundness**: Reviewers have raised several concerns regarding the technical soundness of the paper, including issues with the analysis in Section 4, the comparison between the optimal convex relaxation and the proposed method, and the lack of clarity in explaining why the proposed regularizer is effective. These concerns suggest that the paper may have technical flaws or, at the very least, lacks clear explanations of its methodology and contributions.\n\n3. **Experimental Evaluation**: The paper presents experimental results showing that the proposed regularizations lead to tighter certification bounds than non-regularized baselines. However, reviewers have pointed out the need for more comprehensive experiments, including the use of additional datasets beyond MNIST, which is considered simplistic for serious research. The comparison with other state-of-the-art methods, such as those by Gowal et al. and Wong et al., is also deemed insufficient or unclear.\n\n4. **Presentation and Clarity**: Reviewers have noted presentation issues, such as typos, formatting problems, and a lack of clarity in certain sections, particularly in the analysis and explanation of the proposed regularizers. Clear and concise writing is crucial for a paper to be accepted at a top-tier conference.\n\n5. **Impact and Relevance**: The problem addressed by the paper is interesting and relevant to the field of neural network robustness. The proposed solution has the potential to contribute meaningfully to the area, as indicated by the experimental results. However, the paper's impact is somewhat diminished by its technical and presentation issues.\n\nConsidering these points, the decision to accept or reject the paper hinges on the severity of the technical concerns, the clarity and completeness of the experimental evaluation, and the overall presentation quality. While the paper addresses an important problem and shows promising results, the technical issues and lack of clarity raised by the reviewers are significant.\n\nGiven the information provided and the fact that author responses are not included to address the reviewers' concerns, the paper in its current form does not meet the high standards expected of a top-tier conference due to its technical flaws, presentation issues, and insufficient experimental comparison.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

This contribution is significant as it addresses an important problem in machine learning with a novel approach based on geometric approximation algorithms. However, Reviewer 3 questions the novelty, suggesting that transforming the problem into a linear programming formulation might not be a complicated step. The authors need to clarify and emphasize the novelty and significance of their approach compared to existing methods.\n\n2. **Technical Soundness**: The technical approach seems sound, leveraging tools from the theory of linear programming in low dimensions to achieve the FPTAS. However, several reviewers have raised specific technical questions and concerns, such as the explanation for Lemma 2.1, the definition of \"accuracy\" in Theorem 1.1, and the computational hardness of the problem. These concerns need to be addressed to ensure the technical soundness of the paper.\n\n3. **Experimental Results**: The paper presents experimental results showing favorable performance compared to other methods like ITML and LMNN, especially in the presence of adversarial noise.

Reviewer 1 and Reviewer 2 have emphasized the need for a more rigorous theoretical foundation to support the claims made in the paper. This is a significant concern, as a top-tier conference expects papers to have a strong theoretical basis.\n\nSecondly, the experimental results have been questioned by the reviewers.

The empirical results for on-policy methods (A2C and PPO) are strong and demonstrate the value of this approach. The ablation experiments are also insightful, and the detailed appendix provides confidence that readers can reproduce the method.\n\nHowever, there are some concerns raised by the reviewers. Reviewer 1 notes that the story for off-policy methods (SAC) seems almost unrelated, with a more restrictive generative model, a heuristic optimization method, and weaker experimental results. Reviewer 2 questions the significance of the proposed approach in practice, given that it does not obviously improve the performance of SAC, which is a state-of-the-art method for continuous control tasks. Reviewer 3 suggests that Section 3.2 could be moved to the appendix and that the font used in the figures is very small. Reviewer 4 notes that the idea of the paper directly follows van Hoof et al. (2017) and is not much different, and that the proposed method is not effective for SAC and even degrades the performance of the HalfCheetah task.\n\nDespite these concerns, the paper has several strengths. The proposed method is mathematically solid, and the authors provide detailed mathematical derivations to support their approach. The method significantly outperforms the baselines for on-policy methods, and the authors provide ablative studies to investigate the hyper-parameter values and components of the proposed method.\n\nTo address the concerns, the authors could consider reframing the paper as an on-policy method and explicitly addressing the off-policy case as a limitation, as suggested by Reviewer 1. They could also provide additional experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on more complicated domains and pure exploration or sparse rewarded tasks, as suggested by Reviewer 4.\n\nOverall, the paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of reinforcement learning, and the strengths of the paper outweigh the weaknesses. The proposed method is novel, mathematically solid, and demonstrates strong empirical results for on-policy methods.\n\nFinal Decision: Accept"

The paper attempts to connect theoretical insights with practical improvements in meta-learning, which is a valuable contribution to the field.\n\nHowever, several concerns and weaknesses are raised by the reviewers that impact the paper's novelty, technical soundness, and overall contribution. A primary concern is the novelty of the proposed regularization methods. Reviewers 1 and 4 question whether the regularization techniques, such as penalizing the condition number of the weight matrix and using the Frobenius norm regularization, are truly new or if they resemble existing methods like spectral normalization and weight decay.

While the results show improvement over vanilla meta-learning methods, some reviewers (e.g., Reviewer 1 and Reviewer 3) suggest that these improvements might not be significantly beyond the standard deviation or might be achievable with simpler tricks, as shown in other works. The lack of comprehensive comparisons with recent methods and the absence of baseline values in some tables are also highlighted as weaknesses.\n\nAdditionally, there are technical concerns regarding the consistency of the theoretical setting with the few-shot learning setting, the clarity on task distribution assumptions, and the difference in the meta-learning loss function used in the paper compared to popular objectives like MAML. The calculation of subgradients of the singular values is noted as complicated and not fully detailed, which could affect the reproducibility and practicality of the proposed method.\n\nConsidering the points raised by the reviewers, while the paper has an interesting motivation and attempts to bridge an important gap between theory and practice in meta-learning, the concerns regarding novelty, technical soundness, and the experimental evaluation outweigh its strengths.

The paper only presents results on simple toy datasets and MNIST, which is not convincing enough to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The lack of comparison with state-of-the-art pruning techniques and the absence of experiments on more complex datasets, such as CIFAR, raise concerns about the robustness and generalizability of the method.\n\nThirdly, the paper relies heavily on an unpublished work, which makes it impossible to verify the correctness and validity of the proposed technique. The lack of derivation and explanation of the equations used in the algorithm, particularly in the third step of the pruning technique, raises concerns about the soundness of the methodology.\n\nFourthly, the presentation of the paper needs significant improvement. The architecture and methodology are not clearly explained, and the notation is often confusing. The paper contains numerous typos and grammatical errors, which further detract from its overall quality.\n\nLastly, the novelty and originality of the proposed algorithm are questionable. Several reviewers have pointed out that the ideas presented in the paper are not particularly new, and the technique bears similarities to existing methods, such as the highway network.\n\nIn light of these concerns and weaknesses, it is clear that the paper is not ready for publication in its current form. The authors need to address the major issues raised by the reviewers, including improving the clarity and readability of the paper, providing more convincing experimental results, and verifying the correctness and validity of the proposed technique.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

The authors propose a cortico-cerebellar-DNI (CC-DNI) model, which they test on various sensorimotor and cognitive tasks, demonstrating its potential in facilitating learning and improving performance.\n\nThe reviewer comments highlight both the strengths and weaknesses of the paper. Reviewer 1 praises the intriguing hypothesis and the potential benefits of the paper's publication but suggests improvements in clarity, particularly in distinguishing between feedforward and recurrent settings, and in providing more details on the model's mechanisms, such as the use of bootstrapping. Reviewer 2 is less enthusiastic, arguing that the paper does not offer new insights into either the cerebellum or DNIs, as it primarily juxtaposes existing knowledge without adding significant novelty. Reviewer 3 appreciates the novel idea linking DNIs with the cerebellum but criticizes the lack of comparison with experimental findings from cerebellum research and the need for more concrete, testable predictions.\n\nAnalyzing the comments, several key points emerge:\n1. **Novelty and Insight**: The paper's novelty is debated. While it offers a fresh perspective on the cerebellum's role, some reviewers question whether it truly advances our understanding of the cerebellum or DNIs.\n2. **Clarity and Detail**: There's a consensus on the need for improved clarity, especially in technical aspects and in distinguishing between different settings (feedforward vs. recurrent).\n3. **Comparison with Experimental Findings**: A significant criticism is the lack of direct comparison with experimental data from cerebellum studies, which weakens the paper's scientific impact.\n4. **Testable Predictions**: The absence of clear, testable predictions that can be verified through experiments is seen as a major shortfall.\n\nConsidering these points, the paper has potential due to its novel hypothesis and the clarity of its presentation. However, it falls short in providing substantial new insights, lacking a rigorous comparison with experimental cerebellum research, and not offering concrete predictions that can be tested. These are critical aspects for a paper aiming for publication in a top-tier conference, where novelty, scientific rigor, and potential impact are paramount.\n\nGiven the current state of the paper, it seems that while it presents an interesting idea, it requires significant revisions to address the reviewers' concerns, particularly in terms of grounding the hypothesis in experimental evidence and providing testable predictions. Without these revisions, the paper's contribution to the field, as presented, may not meet the standards expected for publication in a top-tier conference.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

The authors claim that their approach can generate original arrangements for bass and voice lines, and they evaluate their model on two downstream tasks: generating drum accompaniment for a given bass line and arranging an acapella song into a full song.\n\nThe reviewers have raised several concerns and suggestions for improvement. Reviewer 1 points out that the title is misleading, as the paper focuses on automatic accompaniment rather than music production. They also criticize the lack of motivation for the demand for automatic accompaniment technology from artists and producers. Additionally, Reviewer 1 notes that the authors claim to be the first to treat music audio as images, but this approach is already standard in many music information retrieval (MIR) tasks.\n\nReviewer 2 suggests that the authors should have used variants of CycleGAN and other unpaired image-to-image translation models for comparison. They also point out that the experimental settings could have more variety, such as generating a bass line given the drums. Reviewer 2 criticizes the evaluation and discussion, suggesting that the authors should have included more details on inter-annotator agreement and the effect of source separation in the generated audio.\n\nReviewer 3 finds the paper interesting and well-written but suggests that the experiments could be improved by quantitatively evaluating the impact of using automatically separated signals produced by DEMUCS on the FMA dataset. They also point out that many technical details are omitted, making it impossible to reproduce the results.\n\nAfter carefully considering the reviewers' comments, I conclude that the paper has several major flaws that need to be addressed before it can be considered for publication. The title is misleading, and the authors' claims about being the first to treat music audio as images are incorrect. The experimental settings are limited, and the evaluation and discussion lack depth. Additionally, many technical details are omitted, making it impossible to reproduce the results.\n\nThe authors need to revise the paper to address these concerns, including updating the title, providing more motivation for the demand for automatic accompaniment technology, and including more variety in the experimental settings.

The authors argue that using language to modulate both top-down and bottom-up visual processing pathways can lead to significant improvements over traditional methods that only consider top-down attention. The paper is well-written, and the task of segmenting objects based on referring expressions is important and well-chosen.\n\nHowever, upon careful analysis of the reviewer comments and the authors' responses, several concerns arise that impact the paper's potential for acceptance at a top-tier conference. \n\n1. **Novelty and Contribution**: Reviewer 1 suggests that the novelty and contribution of the paper are \"rather thin\" because many ways of modeling language are not explored. This concern is echoed by Reviewer 4, who questions the originality of the model and its conceptual contribution beyond numerical task improvements. The authors' response does not fully address these concerns, as they do not provide a clear motivation for their model based on cognitive science or a priori expectations for the task.\n\n2. **Empirical Results and Significance**: Reviewer 2 and Reviewer 4 express concerns about the empirical results. Despite the authors' claims of achieving state-of-the-art or competitive results, the performance on certain metrics and datasets is not consistently superior to existing works. Moreover, Reviewer 4 points out the lack of statistical significance tests, which makes it difficult to assess the reliability of the reported improvements. The variability in results across different evaluation sets and the absence of a thorough error analysis to understand the model's success also raise doubts.\n\n3. **Model Analysis and Interpretability**: Several reviewers (Reviewer 1, Reviewer 2, and Reviewer 4) request more insight into how the linguistic representations interact with the visual processing pathway. They suggest that the paper lacks a satisfactory analysis of what exactly the linguistic representations contribute to the model's performance, especially in terms of modulating low-level visual features. This lack of transparency and interpretability makes it challenging to understand the model's strengths and limitations.\n\n4. **Response to Reviewer Comments**: The authors' responses to some of the reviewer comments, particularly those related to the novelty of the work, the motivation behind the model design, and the empirical results, do not fully address the concerns raised. For instance, the reference to Mei et al. (2018) as a baseline, which is not found in the paper, raises questions about the completeness of the related work and the novelty of the proposed approach.\n\nConsidering these points, while the paper addresses an important problem and presents some promising results, the concerns regarding its novelty, the significance and reliability of its empirical contributions, and the lack of deep analysis into the model's workings are substantial. These issues undermine the paper's potential for making a significant and lasting contribution to the field as required by a top-tier conference.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

Reviewer 1 questions the novelty of the approach, arguing that ChevNet can already incorporate the entire graph by setting a large K, and that the failure of ChevNet is due to over-overparameterization and overfitting rather than the limitation of local attention. Reviewer 1 also criticizes the complexity of the proposed model, arguing that it is not linear in O(V) and that the non-local attention makes it unable to leverage efficient matrix eigen decomposition.\n\nReviewer 2 likes the paper but lacks the expertise to evaluate the experimental results and theoretical contributions. Reviewer 3 finds the paper to be well-motivated and intuitive, with thorough empirical evaluation, but criticizes the lack of scalability and the limited number of disassortative graphs used in the experiments. Reviewer 4 criticizes the limited novelty of the approach, arguing that using attention to capture features from far-away nodes is not new, and that the proposed model may suffer from overfitting.\n\nDespite these criticisms, the paper has several strengths. The proposed model is well-motivated and intuitive, and the empirical evaluation is thorough and demonstrates the effectiveness of the model on both assortative and disassortative graphs. The paper also addresses an important problem in the field of graph neural networks, which is the limitation of local homophily.\n\nHowever, the concerns about complexity and scalability are significant. The proposed model requires computing the entire φ matrix, which has a complexity of more than O(|V|^2), and the non-local attention makes it unable to leverage efficient matrix eigen decomposition.

The limitations in the applicability of the analytical bounds, the lack of empirical validation for more complex architectures, and the concerns about the novelty and significance of the contributions are significant enough to warrant rejection.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

The authors propose a way to combine weak learners effectively to generate a near-optimal policy, leveraging boosting ideas from supervised learning. The technical results needed to achieve the sample complexity guarantee may be of independent interest.\n\nHowever, the paper suffers from significant clarity and readability issues. Many reviewers have pointed out that the paper is extremely dense and hard to read, with notation overload, typos, and undefined notation. The lack of motivation and justification for definitions and algorithmic/analytical design choices makes it difficult for readers to understand the approach and results. The paper would benefit from more supporting text explaining the reasoning behind the definitions and algorithms.\n\nAdditionally, some reviewers have raised concerns about the novelty and significance of the contributions. While the idea of applying boosting to RL is interesting, some reviewers have noted that the techniques used are similar to those in prior work (e.g., Hazan and Singh, 2021). The paper could be strengthened by more discussion of the differences between the proposed approach and existing work.\n\nThe empirical novelty and significance of the paper are also limited, as there are no numerical experiments or comparisons with existing algorithms. The paper would benefit from the inclusion of some initial experiments to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.\n\nDespite these limitations, some reviewers have noted that the core idea of the paper is valuable and could be of interest to both the RL and optimization communities. With significant revisions to address the clarity and readability issues, as well as more discussion of the novelty and significance of the contributions, the paper could be strengthened.\n\nBased on the reviews, I believe that the paper requires major revisions to address the clarity, readability, and novelty concerns.

The paper is well-written, and the idea of using VAEs for time-series generation is interesting. However, after carefully analyzing the reviewer comments, several concerns and limitations have been raised that impact the paper's overall quality and contribution to the field.\n\nOne of the primary concerns is the lack of substantial originality in the proposed method.

Reviewer 3 also questions the technical contribution, stating that the paper lacks general context of the literature in several areas, including state-space models and deep generative models for sequential prediction tasks.\n\nAnother significant issue is the limited empirical evaluation. Reviewer 1 points out that the hyper-parameters of the core building blocks are not evaluated properly, and there are no ablation studies to support the claims made about the model's interpretability. Reviewer 3 also criticizes the experimental methodology, suggesting that the experiments should include probabilistic autoregressive models and be conducted on well-known datasets to allow for comparison with other state-of-the-art methods.\n\nFurthermore, the paper's claims about interpretability and the ability to encode domain knowledge are not adequately supported. Reviewer 1 asks for evidence on how interpretable the newly introduced building blocks are, and Reviewer 4 notes that there is no discussion about interpretability in the results section.

The method introduces a family of non-Markovian samplers, Generalized Gaussian Diffusion Models (GGDM), which can be optimized using a perceptual loss function. The paper presents impressive results on unconditional image generation across various datasets, achieving strong FID scores with a reduced number of inference steps.\n\nThe reviewer comments highlight both the strengths and weaknesses of the paper. Reviewers 1 and 2 appreciate the paper's contributions to the field of diffusion-based generative models, but raise concerns about the lack of theoretical guarantees, the optimality of the proposed method, and the potential for overfitting to evaluation metrics. Reviewer 3 finds the paper interesting and the results compelling, but notes that the proposed method's benefits are mainly due to the optimization procedure, and the GGDP sampler may not stand on its own as a better sampler. Reviewer 4 questions the theoretical soundness of the proposed approach, the generality of the results, and the novelty of the method. Reviewer 5 praises the paper's simplicity and empirical performance but criticizes the clarity and suggests improvements.\n\nAfter carefully considering the reviewer comments, it is clear that the paper has both merits and demerits.

      "response": "The paper \"Meta-Referential Games to Learn Compositional Learning Behaviours\" proposes a novel benchmark for investigating state-of-the-art artificial agents' abilities to exhibit compositional learning behaviors. The authors introduce a Symbolic Continuous Stimulus (SCS) representation and cast the problem of learning compositional behaviors as a meta-reinforcement learning problem. However, after carefully analyzing the paper and the reviewer comments, several concerns and issues arise that impact the paper's overall quality and contribution to the field.\n\nFirstly, the paper is difficult to follow, with reviewers commenting on the lack of clarity in the introduction, the complexity of the sentences, and the absence of concrete examples to illustrate key concepts. This lack of clarity hinders the understanding of the proposed method and its significance, making it challenging for readers to grasp the main contributions of the paper.\n\nSecondly, the proposed SCS representation, while interesting, lacks a clear justification for its use over other representations, such as one-hot encodings (OHE) or continuous representations. Reviewers have pointed out that the arguments against OHE are not convincing, and the benefits of SCS are not clearly demonstrated. Furthermore, the limitations of SCS, such as its inability to adapt to more latent dimensions or extrapolate to dimensions with larger sizes, are not adequately addressed.\n\nThirdly, the experimental evaluation of the proposed method is limited, with reviewers criticizing the lack of ablation studies, the poor tuning of hyperparameters, and the failure to demonstrate the value of SCS on existing compositional generalization challenges. The results presented are barely above chance performance, which does not provide a compelling endorsement of the SCS representation.\n\nFourthly, the paper lacks engagement with the broader literature on compositional generalization, with reviewers pointing out the overlap with existing research and the need to situate the work within this literature. The authors' failure to address these concerns and provide a clear contribution to the field raises questions about the paper's technical novelty and significance.\n\nLastly, the reviewers have identified several minor issues with the paper's claims, requiring small changes to be made correct. However, the main concerns lie in the paper's overall clarity, the justification of the proposed method, and the limited experimental evaluation.\n\nConsidering these concerns and issues, it is clear that the paper requires significant revisions to address the reviewers' comments and improve its overall quality. While the idea of compositional learning through meta-referential games is intriguing, the paper's current state does not meet the standards of a top-tier conference.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

The reviewers' comments offer a range of perspectives on the paper's strengths, weaknesses, and potential contributions to the field.\n\nOne of the primary strengths of the paper is its ability to provide a simple, analytically tractable model that exhibits epoch-wise double descent, a phenomenon previously observed in deep neural networks. Reviewer 1 praises the paper's clarity, motivation, and presentation, highlighting its value in demonstrating that another exotic behavior of deep neural networks is already present in simple, linear models. Reviewer 2 notes that the work is solid, with theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation, although suggesting connections to other pioneering works in the field could enhance its significance.\n\nHowever, several reviewers raise concerns about the paper's novelty and significance. Reviewer 3 questions whether the intuition involved in the paper (introducing multiple scales into the problem) has appeared before, suggesting a need for more discussion on how this work relates to existing literature. Reviewer 2 points out the implicit regularization effects of SGD/GD on least square linear regression and suggests discussing connections to other works on Ridge-style implicit regularization. These comments indicate that while the paper makes a contribution, its novelty and impact might be somewhat diminished by existing research in the area.\n\nAdditionally, Reviewer 3 identifies numerous typos and minor errors in the manuscript, which, although not major, divert the flow of the calculations and make it challenging to assess the correctness of the final results. This highlights the need for careful proofreading and attention to detail to ensure the manuscript's quality.\n\nThe paper's technical novelty and significance are rated differently by the reviewers. Reviewer 1 sees the work as valuable with significant contributions, albeit with some aspects existing in prior work. Reviewer 2 and Reviewer 3 are more conservative in their assessments, with Reviewer 3 stating that the contributions are only marginally significant or novel.\n\nConsidering the comments and ratings provided by the reviewers, the paper demonstrates a good understanding of the topic and provides a clear, well-motivated analysis of epoch-wise double descent in a linear setting. However, the concerns about novelty, the need for clearer connections to existing literature, and the presence of minor errors suggest that the paper could benefit from revisions to strengthen its contribution and clarity.\n\nGiven the overall positive assessment of the paper's quality, its potential to contribute to the understanding of neural network dynamics, and considering the suggestions for improvement, the decision leans towards accepting the paper, provided that the authors address the raised concerns and improve the manuscript accordingly.\n\nFinal Decision: Accept"

The authors draw inspiration from neuroscience, specifically the thalamocortical circuit, to develop a method that constrains RNNs to function similarly during motif transitions, thereby enhancing their performance in zero-shot transfer to new motif chains.\n\nThe reviewer comments provide a comprehensive overview of the paper's strengths and weaknesses. Reviewer 1 remains unconvinced despite the authors' efforts to address their concerns. Reviewer 2 questions the necessity of the proposed resetting mechanism, suggesting alternative approaches that could achieve similar results. Reviewer 3 expresses low enthusiasm for the work, citing the small scale of the models and data, as well as the lack of evaluation of alternative approaches. Reviewer 4 finds the modification to the control network simple and effective but has low confidence in the novelty and significance of the analytical work. Reviewer 5 acknowledges the relevance of the topic but finds the presentation confusing and difficult to understand, raising concerns about the clarity of the task description and the existence of a trivial solution.\n\nAfter carefully analyzing the reviewer comments, several key points emerge:\n\n1. **Technical Novelty and Significance**: The majority of reviewers (Reviewers 2, 3, and 5) rate the technical novelty and significance of the contributions as marginal or not well-supported. This suggests that the paper may not introduce substantially new or impactful ideas to the field.\n\n2. **Empirical Novelty and Significance**: Similarly, the empirical contributions are viewed as marginal by most reviewers, indicating that the experiments, while potentially interesting, may not significantly advance the state of the art in a way that is broadly applicable or impactful.\n\n3. **Correctness and Clarity**: There are concerns about the correctness of some claims and the clarity of the presentation. Reviewer 5, in particular, highlights issues with the writing style and the organization of the paper, which hampers the communication of the scientific ideas.\n\n4. **Alternative Approaches**: Several reviewers suggest that the authors have not adequately considered or tested alternative approaches that could achieve similar or better results without the need for the proposed thalamocortical-inspired mechanism. This raises questions about the necessity and uniqueness of the proposed solution.\n\n5. **Scale and Relevance**: The small scale of the models and the synthetic nature of the task, as pointed out by Reviewer 3, diminish the potential contribution of this work to the broader field of machine learning and its applicability to more complex, real-world problems.\n\nConsidering these points, while the paper explores an interesting intersection of neuroscience and machine learning, the concerns raised by the reviewers regarding novelty, significance, clarity, and the adequacy of the approach outweigh the potential benefits of the work as presented.

While the methods are straightforward, as noted by several reviewers, they demonstrate significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods. However, the novelty of the approach is somewhat debated among the reviewers, with some (Reviewers 4 and 7) suggesting that the contributions are only marginally significant or novel, and others (Reviewers 5 and 6) finding the contributions significant and somewhat new.\n\n2. **Empirical Novelty and Significance**: The empirical results presented in the paper are strong, showing that the proposed SCRFD method outperforms other state-of-the-art face detection algorithms, such as TinaFace, on the WIDER FACE dataset. This improvement is not only in terms of accuracy but also in computational efficiency, which is a significant contribution given the constraints of many real-world applications. Reviewers generally agree that the empirical contributions are significant, although some suggest that comparisons with other network search methods are needed for a more comprehensive evaluation.\n\n3. **Correctness**: Most reviewers found the paper's claims to be well-supported, although a few minor issues were noted. Reviewer 4 mentioned that some statements require small changes to be correct, and Reviewer 7 pointed out the lack of detail in certain aspects, such as the sample distribution and the need for an algorithm to describe the computation redistribution method. However, these issues do not seem to undermine the overall validity of the research.\n\n4. **Quality of Research and Writing**: The paper is well-written, and the experiments are extensively conducted on relevant datasets. The authors have also made their code available, which is a positive aspect for reproducibility. However, some reviewers suggested improvements, such as adding more figures to illustrate the framework, providing more details on certain methods, and conducting more comparisons with state-of-the-art network search methods.\n\nConsidering these aspects, the paper demonstrates significant empirical contributions, particularly in terms of improving the accuracy and efficiency of face detection. While the technical novelty might be debated, the practical impact and the thoroughness of the experimental evaluation are notable strengths. The minor issues regarding correctness and the need for additional comparisons or details do not outweigh the paper's strengths, especially given the authors' responsiveness to reviewer comments and the availability of their code for further research and verification.\n\nFinal Decision: Accept"

They mention that the platform, while useful and well-engineered, implements existing techniques with only minor contributions, such as the Believer-Penalizer (BP) strategy. Reviewer 5 is more positive, noting the significance of the problem studied and the convenience of the framework but also acknowledges that aspects of the contributions exist in prior work.\n\n2. **Empirical Novelty and Significance**: The empirical results presented in the paper are a point of contention. Reviewers 1 and 4 note that the performance of AutoOED and its BP strategy is not consistently better than other methods across all benchmarks. Reviewer 4 specifically mentions that the claims of outperforming other methods are overstated based on the results shown.

Reviewer 4 also points out the need for better motivation of the threshold used in the BP strategy and questions the comparison with other packages.\n\n4. **Engineering Contribution**: The paper is praised for its engineering contribution, particularly in making multi-objective Bayesian optimization accessible through a user-friendly interface. Reviewers acknowledge the value of AutoOED as a tool for both experts and non-experts, although some question its novelty and significance in the context of existing tools and methodologies.\n\n5. **Comparison with Existing Work**: Several reviewers note that the paper could benefit from a more comprehensive comparison with existing Bayesian optimization platforms and a clearer discussion of how AutoOED advances the state-of-the-art, especially considering its limitations (e.g., scalability to more than 3 objectives).\n\nGiven these considerations, the decision to accept or reject the paper hinges on the conference's priorities regarding novelty, significance, and the balance between technical contributions and engineering efforts. Top-tier conferences typically prioritize papers with significant technical novelty, strong empirical evidence, and clear advancements over the state-of-the-art.\n\nWhile AutoOED represents a valuable engineering effort and contributes to making multi-objective optimization more accessible, the concerns raised by the reviewers regarding its technical novelty, the consistency of its performance advantages, and the clarity of its contributions over existing work are significant.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

The paper is well-written, easy to follow, and presents a clear motivation for the proposed approach. However, after carefully analyzing the reviewer comments, several concerns arise that impact the paper's overall quality, novelty, and significance.\n\nFirstly, the novelty of the paper is questioned by multiple reviewers. Reviewer 1 states that the core idea of penalizing previously generated tokens has been proposed before, and the authors' claim that unlikelihood training only considers the probabilities of negative tokens is disputed. Reviewer 3 also mentions that the idea is very similar to \"unlikelihood training.\" This lack of novelty is a significant concern, as top-tier conferences typically expect innovative and groundbreaking research.\n\nSecondly, the experimental setup and results are criticized by several reviewers. Reviewer 1 suggests that the experiments are insufficient and that the metrics used (e.g., perplexity) are not reliable for evaluating text generation tasks. Reviewer 2 points out that the experimental setup is weak, using only GPT2-small, and that the metrics reported (e.g., dist-1) are not convincing. Reviewer 4 also questions the importance of the repetition issue for better or larger models and suggests that scaling experiments could help resolve this question.\n\nThirdly, the human evaluation results are not statistically significant, and some claims made by the authors are not supported by the human evaluation. Reviewer 4 mentions that the human evaluation does not show a preference for the proposed approach over one of the baselines (UL-TS).\n\nLastly, while the paper is well-written and easy to follow, the reproducibility is good, and the code is provided, the technical and empirical novelty and significance are only marginally significant or novel, according to multiple reviewers.\n\nConsidering these concerns, it is clear that the paper has some merits, such as a well-motivated approach and interesting ideas. However, the lack of novelty, insufficient experimental setup, and non-statistically significant human evaluation results are significant drawbacks.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

The authors rely heavily on empirical experiments, which, although interesting, do not provide a clear understanding of why the swapped order improves performance. Reviewer 1 and Reviewer 5 point out that the paper lacks clear explanations and rigorous proofs to support its claims.\n\nSecondly, the experimental setup and analysis have some limitations. Reviewer 2 and Reviewer 5 note that the paper only considers a limited set of architectures and activation functions, and the results may not generalize to other cases. Additionally, Reviewer 5 points out that the paper's comparison to ReLU-based networks is not fair, as the swapped order with bounded activation functions still performs worse than the conventional order with ReLU.\n\nThirdly, the paper's conclusions are not consistently supported by the experimental results. Reviewer 3 and Reviewer 5 note that the saturation metric seems incomplete, and the observations on saturation and sparsity do not hold uniformly across all layers. Reviewer 5 also points out that the paper's statement on the relationship between saturation and sparsity is contradictory.\n\nLastly, the paper's practical contributions are limited.

The idea of combining these two approaches is intriguing, and the paper demonstrates promising results on the SameGame domain.\n\nHowever, upon closer examination, several concerns arise that impact the paper's overall quality, novelty, and significance. \n\n1. **Lack of Clarity and Presentation**: Reviewer 1 highlights significant issues with the paper's clarity and presentation. The exposition of the method is unclear, and the writing requires multiple passes to understand. This lack of clarity hinders the reader's ability to fully grasp the contributions and methodology of the paper.\n\n2. **Limited Empirical Evaluation**: The empirical evaluation of the MCTransformer is limited to the SameGame domain, which is considered a relatively simple or \"toy-ish\" domain by Reviewer 1. The lack of comparison with other well-established methods, such as Decision Transformers or Online DTs, and the absence of experiments on more complex or benchmarked domains (like MiniGo or Atari), raises questions about the generalizability and robustness of the MCTransformer.\n\n3. **Novelty and Originality**: Reviewers 2 and 3 express concerns about the novelty of the paper, suggesting that the combination of MCTS with Transformers, although interesting, does not significantly depart from existing methods like AlphaGo/AlphaZero. The use of a Transformer instead of a ResNet in an MCTS setting is seen as a straightforward substitution rather than a groundbreaking innovation.\n\n4. **Fairness of Comparisons**: Reviewer 2 questions the fairness of the comparisons made in the paper, particularly the MCTS baseline, which does not utilize a learned prior policy or value function. This omission makes the comparison to MCTransformer somewhat unfair, as MCTransformer benefits from the integration of a Transformer.\n\n5. **Reproducibility and Code Availability**: While Reviewer 3 mentions that the paper provides enough information for reproducibility, Reviewer 2 notes the absence of source code, which is a significant concern for ensuring the reproducibility of the results.\n\nConsidering these points, the paper's limitations in terms of clarity, empirical evaluation, novelty, and fairness of comparisons outweigh its potential contributions. While the idea of combining MCTS with Transformers is promising, the execution and presentation of this idea in the paper fall short of the standards expected for a top-tier conference.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

The authors claim that PVP works better than existing validation protocols on three data modalities, demonstrating its feasibility towards ML production.\n\nHowever, upon analyzing the reviewer comments, several concerns and weaknesses are raised. Reviewer 1 points out that the paper lacks clarity, particularly in the experiments section, and that the empirical evaluation is not thorough. They also question the novelty of the proposed scheme and suggest that the authors should demonstrate the effectiveness of PVP in model selection and hyperparameter tuning. Reviewer 2 expresses concerns about the empirical evaluation, stating that the datasets used are too small and that the authors should provide more theoretical guarantees. Reviewer 3 agrees that the problem addressed is significant but points out that the experiments are limited and that more ablation studies are required to support the hypothesis. Reviewer 4 recommends rejecting the paper, stating that there is no reason to believe that the proximal set constructed is representative of the data generating distribution.\n\nConsidering the reviewer comments, the paper's weaknesses and limitations are significant.

      "response": "The paper \"Detecting Out-of-Distribution Data with Semi-supervised Graph 'Feature' Networks\" presents an interesting idea of leveraging graph structures and topological properties to detect out-of-distribution (OOD) data. The authors propose a mechanism for deriving low-dimensional representations suitable for effective use of established non-parametric and parametric OOD data detection methods. However, after carefully analyzing the paper and the reviewer comments, several concerns and weaknesses have been identified that impact the paper's overall quality and readiness for publication in a top-tier conference.\n\n1. **Lack of Clarity and Detail**: Multiple reviewers (Reviewer 1, Reviewer 2, Reviewer 3, and Reviewer 4) have pointed out that the paper lacks clarity and detail in its presentation. This includes poorly defined terms, insufficient explanation of the feature extraction procedure, and inadequate description of the experimental setup. For instance, Reviewer 1 mentions that the paper uses weakly defined terms like \"Common sense\" and that the relationship between the summary in the introduction and the actual implementation is not straightforward. Reviewer 4 notes that the experimental section is far from enough to validate the effectiveness of the introduced method and that the paper is poorly written with lots of glitches and missing details.\n\n2. **Weakness in Experimental Validation**: The reviewers have also criticized the experimental validation of the proposed method. Reviewer 2 states that the empirical results are not convincing and that the proposed method is not compared to existing state-of-the-art methods for OOD detection. Reviewer 4 suggests that the comparison of other feature-based OOD detection methods and the use of other commonly used in-distribution data like CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet are missing. Furthermore, Reviewer 4 points out the need for an ablation study of the hyperparameters and the interpretation of the OOD detection by semantic graph.\n\n3. **Novelty and Significance**: While the idea presented in the paper is considered interesting by some reviewers (Reviewer 3 and Reviewer 4), the overall novelty and significance of the contributions are questioned. Reviewer 1 suggests that the paper's claims are plausible but require more rigorous demonstration. Reviewer 3 believes that the method lacks novelty as it combines several well-defined methods. Reviewer 4 notes that the assumption of having an oracle object detector for all in-distribution data is unrealistic.\n\n4. **Comparison to State-of-the-Art (SoTA) Techniques**: The paper claims to achieve performance comparable to SoTA techniques but does not provide a direct comparison. Reviewer 1 mentions that typically, such claims are validated by reproducing the SoTA techniques for controlled comparisons. The lack of a thorough comparison with existing methods undermines the paper's claim of being competitive with the state-of-the-art.\n\n5. **Grammatical Mistakes and Poor Writing**: Several reviewers have mentioned that the paper contains grammatical mistakes and is poorly written, which hinders understanding and clarity.\n\nConsidering these points, while the paper presents an interesting approach to detecting OOD data, its current form is not suitable for publication in a top-tier conference due to significant issues with clarity, experimental validation, novelty, and overall presentation quality.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

The authors demonstrate that this approach can lead to higher accuracy across various datasets and architectures, especially when training data is limited.\n\nHowever, upon careful analysis of the reviewer comments, several concerns and weaknesses are raised that impact the paper's overall quality and significance. \n\n1. **Lack of Clarity and Reproducibility**: Multiple reviewers (Reviewer 1 and Reviewer 4) point out issues with clarity, including the explanation of key concepts such as \"dense labels\" and the procedure for generating binary labels. Reviewer 1 also mentions that the paper lacks sufficient detail for reproducibility, such as the implementation of \"Metabalance\" for multi-task learning and the specific hyperparameters used.\n\n2. **Weak Experimental Evaluation**: Reviewers (Reviewer 1 and Reviewer 2) criticize the experimental section for being weak, suggesting that more analyses, comparisons with additional baselines, and exploration of different datasets and scenarios are needed. Reviewer 2 also notes that the baseline algorithms used for comparison have too low performance, making it hard to assess the true effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\n3. **Limited Technical Novelty and Significance**: Reviewers (Reviewer 3 and Reviewer 4) question the technical novelty and significance of the contributions, suggesting that while the idea is simple and effective, it may not be significant enough for a top-tier conference due to the small empirical improvements and the lack of deeper analysis into the problem of label encoding.\n\n4. **Related Work and Comparison**: Reviewer 1 and Reviewer 3 mention that the discussion of related work is not thorough, particularly in relation to label smoothing, unsupervised meta-learning, and other forms of label encoding. A more comprehensive comparison with existing methods and a clearer explanation of how the proposed approach differs from or improves upon prior work are needed.\n\n5. **Minor Issues and Typos**: Several minor issues, including typos and calculation errors, are pointed out by the reviewers, which, while not critical, detract from the overall quality of the submission.\n\nConsidering these points, while the paper proposes an interesting idea and shows some promising results, the concerns regarding clarity, reproducibility, experimental evaluation, technical novelty, and related work discussion are significant enough to impact the paper's suitability for publication at a top-tier conference in its current form.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

However, Reviewer 3 acknowledges the novelty of applying these methods to tabular data and the significance of the empirical contributions, suggesting that while the individual components may not be new, their application and combination in this specific context could be considered novel and significant.\n\n2. **Empirical Novelty and Significance**: The empirical evaluation of the paper demonstrates a clear improvement over baseline methods, especially in the context of tabular data, which is a significant contribution. Reviewer 3 highlights the thoroughness of the experiments and their convincing nature, indicating that the empirical contributions are both novel and significant.\n\n3. **Clarity and Quality**: Reviewer 1 criticizes the paper for being poorly written, with obscure sentences and grammatical errors, which hampers understanding. In contrast, Reviewers 2 and 3 find the paper well-written and easy to follow, although Reviewer 3 points out minor typos and suggests improvements for clarity and consistency in notation.\n\n4. **Correctness**: All reviewers agree that the paper's claims are mostly correct, with minor issues that could be addressed. Reviewer 3 provides detailed feedback on how certain claims could be better supported or clarified.\n\n5. **Reproducibility**: The authors are commended for providing experimental details, but Reviewer 3 notes a few aspects that could be improved for full reproducibility, such as clarifying how the accuracy over batches is computed and whether there are repetitions over different network initializations.\n\nConsidering these points, the paper's strengths lie in its empirical contributions, the novelty of applying known methods to a new domain (tabular data), and the significance of demonstrating data leakage attacks in federated learning for this type of data. However, the paper's weaknesses include concerns over the novelty of the technical contributions, some minor issues with clarity and correctness, and areas for improvement in reproducibility.\n\nGiven the detailed and mostly positive review by Reviewer 3, and considering the significance of the empirical contributions and the application of the methods to a new and important domain, the paper's strengths outweigh its weaknesses. The minor issues pointed out by the reviewers can be addressed through revisions, which would further strengthen the paper.\n\nFinal Decision: Accept"

The system splits a neural network into two parts: an encoder sent to the client and a classifier on the server, using a center loss function to minimize information leakage.\n\nHowever, upon careful analysis of the reviewer comments, several significant concerns arise that impact the paper's suitability for publication at a top-tier conference:\n\n1. **Lack of Novelty**: Reviewers 1 and 2 mention that the idea of splitting a neural network into two parts for privacy preservation is not new, particularly in the context of privacy-preserving learning. The novelty of the approach is questioned, with Reviewer 2 noting similarities to \"split learning\" without proper citation or differentiation.\n\n2. **Technical Flaws**: Reviewer 2 identifies severe technical flaws in the proposed approach, including the potential for the server to recreate a \"surrogate\" encoder, thereby compromising client data privacy. The reviewer also criticizes the threat model, suggesting it is unrealistic to assume the server would honestly implement the center loss without attempting to exploit the system for privacy invasion.\n\n3. **Limited Experimental Evaluation**: Reviewers 1 and 2 criticize the experimental section for being too simplistic, with evaluations on only two datasets (MNIST and CelebA) and limited model architectures (LeNet-5 and VGG-16). The lack of comparison with more robust baselines, such as fully homomorphic encryption-based approaches, and the absence of experiments on more challenging settings (e.g., identity inference vs. gender recognition) are highlighted as significant shortcomings.\n\n4. **Security Model and Privacy Guarantees**: Reviewers 2 and 3 express concerns about the paper's failure to define a clear security model and provide robust privacy guarantees. The use of middle features of a neural network is deemed risky for information leakage, especially in scenarios involving sensitive data like physiological time-series data from smartwatches.\n\n5. **Clarity and Reproducibility**: While the paper is generally considered clear and easy to follow, there are noted ambiguities and grammatical errors. The reproducibility of the work is questioned due to missing details such as optimizers used and the number of training epochs.\n\nGiven these concerns, the paper falls short of the standards expected for publication at a top-tier conference. The technical flaws, lack of novelty, limited experimental evaluation, and insufficient attention to security models and privacy guarantees are significant enough to outweigh any potential strengths of the paper.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"
