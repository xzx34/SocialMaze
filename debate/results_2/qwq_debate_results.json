      "response": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate whether this paper should be accepted or rejected for a top-tier conference. Let me start by going through all the provided information carefully.\n\nFirst, the paper's title is \"REFINING MONTE CARLO TREE SEARCH AGENTS BY MONTE CARLO TREE SEARCH\". The keywords are Reinforcement Learning, MCTS, and AlphaZero. The abstract mentions that they're looking at the coordination of episode generation in MCTS-based RL methods, aiming to handle the exploration-exploitation trade-off. They tested it on a small problem (like Tic-Tac-Toe) and claim better robustness than AlphaZero.\n\nNow, looking at the reviewer comments. All three reviewers are pretty harsh. Reviewer 1 says the paper is \"less than half-baked\" with no references and poor writing. They suggest resubmitting when it's more complete. Reviewer 2 also points out bad writing, grammatical issues, and that the abstract is unclear. They couldn't understand the paper despite trying. Reviewer 3 mentions poor writing, undefined symbols, formatting issues (like blank spaces and hard-to-read algorithms), and no references. They even say it's not a serious academic work, just notes.\n\nHmm, the common themes here are the writing quality, lack of references, and clarity. The paper seems to have fundamental issues. Even if the idea has potential, the presentation is so poor that reviewers can't even understand the contributions. For a top-tier conference, clarity and proper academic standards are crucial. The lack of references is a big red flag because it shows the authors didn't engage with existing literature. Also, if the paper is 10 pages but has blank spaces and undefined terms, that's a sign of poor preparation.\n\nThe experiments are on a small problem like Tic-Tac-Toe, which might not be sufficient for a top conference unless the method is groundbreaking. But given the other issues, the reviewers didn't even get to evaluate the method properly. The fact that all three reviewers are in agreement about the paper's shortcomings makes me lean towards rejection. Top conferences have high standards, and this paper doesn't meet them in terms of writing, structure, and academic rigor. The authors need to do a lot of work before it's even considered for publication anywhere, let alone a top venue.\n</think>\n\nThe paper under review faces severe and consistent criticisms from all three reviewers, which collectively indicate that it is not suitable for publication at a top-tier conference. Here is the detailed reasoning:\n\n### Key Issues Highlighted by Reviewers:\n1. **Poor Writing and Clarity**:\n   - All reviewers emphasize that the paper is **poorly written**, with **grammatical errors**, **incoherent sentences**, and **inaccurate statements**. Reviewer 2 explicitly states they could not understand the abstract or core ideas, while Reviewer 3 describes \"incomprehensible passages\" and \"blank space\" in the text.\n   - The lack of clarity undermines the ability of reviewers (and future readers) to evaluate the method, experiments, or contributions. For a top-tier conference, clear communication of ideas is non-negotiable.\n\n2. **Lack of Academic Rigor**:\n   - The paper has **no references**, which is a critical omission. A top-tier submission must contextualize its work within existing research, cite prior art (e.g., AlphaZero, MCTS literature), and address gaps in the field. The absence of references suggests the authors did not engage with the literature, raising questions about the novelty and validity of their approach.\n   - Reviewer 3 notes **undefined mathematical symbols** and poorly formatted algorithms, further indicating a lack of attention to detail and academic standards.\n\n3. **Underdeveloped Method and Experiments**:\n   - While the abstract claims the method improves MCTS-based RL (e.g., over AlphaZero), the reviewers could not discern the method’s specifics due to poor writing and lack of clarity. Reviewer 1 notes the paper’s focus on \"master game tree\" coordination but finds the idea \"half-baked.\"\n   - The experiments are limited to a \"small problem\" (e.g., Tic-Tac-Toe), which is insufficient for a top-tier venue unless paired with strong theoretical insights or scalability. However, the reviewers’ inability to understand the method’s design and results further weakens its credibility.\n\n4. **Formatting and Presentation Issues**:\n   - Reviewer 3 highlights **poor formatting**, including \"blank space\" in a 10-page paper and algorithms that are \"very difficult to follow.\" This suggests the submission was not carefully prepared, which is incompatible with the standards of a prestigious conference.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe paper fails to meet the **minimum requirements** for a top-tier conference submission. Its lack of references, poor writing, unclear methodology, and underdeveloped experiments render it incomprehensible and unassessable. While the idea of refining MCTS via MCTS might have merit, the current submission is not a polished, rigorous, or coherent academic work. The reviewers’ consensus that it is \"not a serious academic endeavor\" (Reviewer 3) and \"unfortunately... not represent[ative] even the preliminary elements of scientific writing\" (Reviewer 2) underscores that significant revisions are needed before reconsideration.\n\n**Final Decision: Reject**"

      "correct": true,
      "response": "Okay, let's tackle this. The paper is about out-of-distribution (OOD) detection using the Normalized Compression Distance (NCD) with a method called MALCOM. The key points from the abstract are that it doesn't require OOD samples for validation or retraining the model, which is a practical advantage. The method uses global average pooling and spatial patterns from feature maps.\n\nLooking at the reviewers' comments, there's a mix of positive and critical points. Reviewer 1's main issue is about the fairness of the comparisons. They mention that the paper's replication of prior methods (like Mahalanobis) shows much lower performance than the original papers, which could mean the authors didn't implement them correctly. That's a big red flag because if their baseline results are off, the claimed improvements might not be valid. Also, Reviewer 1 points out that the Mahalanobis method can use adversarial samples for validation without OOD data, which the paper didn't compare against. That's a critical oversight because the paper's constraints (no OOD validation, no retraining) should be properly addressed in the comparisons.\n\nReviewer 2 likes the idea but questions the necessity of the strict constraints. They wonder if there are real scenarios where both OOD data and retraining are impossible. The paper doesn't make a strong case for why this specific setup is important, which might limit its relevance. Also, the reviewer points out some grammatical issues and suggests citing more related work on compression in classification tasks. \n\nReviewer 3 thinks the method is novel but wants more complex experiments, like in safety-critical areas (e.g., autonomous driving). They also note a lack of theoretical guarantees. The experiments might not be thorough enough to show the method's robustness in critical applications.\n\nThe authors' rebuttal didn't address the replication discrepancies, which Reviewer 1 emphasized. The fact that the main comparisons are in the appendix and the original method's performance isn't matched is a problem. If the baselines are not properly implemented, the paper's claims can't be trusted. \n\nThe problem setting is clear, but the method's effectiveness hinges on fair comparisons. Since the reviewers point out that the authors didn't compare against the Mahalanobis method with adversarial validation (which fits the constraints), the paper's contribution might not be as strong as claimed. Also, the ablation study is lacking—Reviewer 1 suggests looking into weighted averaging vs. concatenation for the proposed method, which the authors didn't do. \n\nThe paper's novelty is there, but the experimental validation is shaky. The reviewers are concerned about the practical importance of the constraints and the method's robustness. Without better evidence that the baselines are correctly implemented and that the method outperforms all relevant competitors under the same conditions, the paper might not meet the high standards of a top-tier conference. \n\nFinal Decision: Reject. The main issues are the flawed comparisons, potential implementation errors in baselines, and insufficient justification for the strict constraints. These problems undermine the validity of the results and the method's significance.\n</think>\n\nThe paper proposes MALCOM, an OOD detection method that avoids using OOD validation data or model retraining. While the problem setting is novel and the approach is conceptually interesting, several critical issues undermine its acceptance at a top-tier conference:\n\n1. **Flawed Comparisons and Baseline Replication**:  \n   - Reviewer 1 highlights that the paper’s replication of prior methods (e.g., Mahalanobis) yields significantly worse performance than the original papers, casting doubt on the validity of the comparisons. This could stem from incorrect implementation, which invalidates the claimed improvements.  \n   - The Mahalanobis method can use adversarial samples for validation without OOD data, a scenario the paper fails to address. By omitting this comparison, the authors do not fairly evaluate their method against a constrained baseline that aligns with their own problem setup.  \n\n2. **Unclear Necessity of Constraints**:  \n   - Reviewer 2 questions the practical relevance of the strict constraints (no OOD validation, no retraining). The paper does not convincingly argue why both constraints are simultaneously necessary in real-world scenarios, weakening its motivation.  \n\n3. **Incomplete Method Evaluation**:  \n   - The method’s effectiveness hinges on combining multiple components (e.g., global average pooling and spatial patterns). However, the ablation study is insufficient to isolate the contribution of each component. For instance, the authors do not explore weighted averaging of features (as suggested by Reviewer 1), which could clarify whether the core idea or minor tweaks drive performance.  \n   - Reviewer 3 notes the lack of experiments in critical domains (e.g., autonomous driving) and theoretical guarantees, limiting the method’s perceived robustness and generalizability.  \n\n4. **Presentation and Technical Issues**:  \n   - Key results are relegated to the appendix, making the main paper’s claims appear under-supported.  \n   - Grammatical issues and missing citations (e.g., prior work on compression in classification) weaken the paper’s professionalism.  \n\n**Conclusion**: While the problem is well-defined and the approach is novel, the paper’s failure to address baseline replication issues, provide fair comparisons, and justify its constraints undermines its credibility and significance. Until these concerns are resolved, the work does not meet the rigorous standards of a top-tier conference.  \n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

      "correct": true,
      "response": "Okay, let's tackle this. I need to decide whether to accept or reject this paper for a top-tier conference. Let me start by going through all the provided information carefully.\n\nThe paper's title is \"Effect of Activation Functions on the Training of Overparametrized Neural Nets.\" The abstract mentions that they analyze how activation functions affect training, especially in overparametrized 2-layer networks. They distinguish between non-smooth (like ReLU) and smooth activations (like tanh). Their main results are about the minimum eigenvalue of the Gram matrix (G-matrix) which affects convergence rates. For non-smooth activations, the eigenvalues are large, leading to faster training. For smooth ones, it depends on data dimensionality; low-dimensional data can lead to small eigenvalues, but depth helps. They also did experiments on synthetic and CIFAR10 data.\n\nNow, looking at the reviewer comments. Reviewer 1 says the paper is a needed theoretical analysis, provides proofs in the appendix, and has experiments that align with theory. The weaknesses are the long appendix and some unclear extensions. They also point out some minor typos and a question about the DZXP term. \n\nReviewer 2 is more positive, voting to accept. They appreciate the thorough theoretical work, especially on the eigenvalues and the comparison between smooth and non-smooth activations. They mention the use of polynomial approximations and low-dimensionality. However, they suggest some improvements: referencing theorems in the appendix from the main text, clarifying bounds when data dimensions are large, and organizing the appendix better for readability.\n\nSo, the strengths are clear: the paper addresses an important theoretical gap, provides new insights into activation functions' impact on convergence via eigenvalues of the Gram matrix, and has empirical validation. The experiments support the theory, even if there's a gap on CIFAR10, which the reviewer sees as a strength because it shows where the theory might not fully apply yet.\n\nThe weaknesses are mainly about the paper's length and organization. The appendix is extensive, making the paper long and possibly hard to follow. Reviewer 1 mentions that extensions in the appendix aren't clearly listed, and some theorems in the appendix aren't referenced in the main text. Reviewer 2 also points out that the paper is long and might be tough for a general audience. There are some minor technical issues like typos and unclear phrasing.\n\nBut for a top-tier conference, the key factors are the significance of the contribution, the soundness of the work, and clarity. The theoretical contributions here seem substantial, especially since they're extending prior work by considering different activation functions and their smoothness. The experiments, while not perfect, do validate the theory. The fact that they address both synthetic and real data (CIFAR10) is a plus.\n\nThe length and organization issues are valid concerns. However, top conferences often accept longer papers if the content is valuable, especially in theoretical areas where detailed proofs are necessary. The reviewers suggest improvements, like better organizing the appendix and clarifying some points, which the authors can address in the final version. The minor typos and wording issues are easy fixes.\n\nThe main question is whether the paper's contributions outweigh the structural issues. Since both reviewers lean towards acceptance (with Reviewer 2 explicitly voting to accept and Reviewer 1's comments being more balanced but not outright negative), the consensus seems to favor acceptance. The paper's theoretical depth and empirical validation are strong points. The weaknesses are more about presentation and could be addressed in revisions without major overhauls.\n\nTherefore, I think the paper should be accepted. The authors can work on streamlining the appendix and improving clarity based on the reviewers' feedback. The core contributions are solid and important for the field.\n</think>\n\nThe paper under review makes a significant theoretical contribution to understanding how activation functions influence the training dynamics of overparametrized neural networks, particularly through the lens of the Gram matrix's eigenvalues. The key strengths include:  \n1. **Theoretical Novelty**: The work provides a rigorous analysis of the minimum eigenvalue of the Gram matrix (G-matrix) for both non-smooth and smooth activations, extending prior results that were limited to ReLU or lacked quantitative bounds. The distinction between non-smooth activations (e.g., ReLU) and smooth activations (e.g., tanh) is well-motivated and clarifies why non-smooth activations might dominate in practice.  \n2. **Empirical Validation**: The experiments align with the theoretical findings, even highlighting discrepancies (e.g., on CIFAR10), which adds credibility and depth to the analysis.  \n3. **Broader Implications**: The results suggest practical insights, such as the role of network depth in mitigating eigenvalue issues for smooth activations, and set a foundation for future work on activation function design.  \n\nThe weaknesses are primarily related to presentation and organization:  \n1. **Appendix Overload**: The extensive appendix, while thorough, risks overwhelming readers and obscuring the core contributions. Some theorems and extensions are not clearly referenced in the main text, making the paper harder to follow.  \n2. **Minor Technical Issues**: Typos, unclear phrasing (e.g., the description of the G-matrix’s behavior over time), and a lack of explanation for terms like \"DZXP\" detract from clarity.  \n\nHowever, these issues are addressable through revision. The reviewers’ constructive feedback (e.g., organizing the appendix, clarifying bounds for high-dimensional data) suggests that the paper can be improved without undermining its core contributions.  \n\n**Final Decision: Accept**"

      "response": "Okay, let's tackle this. The paper is about multi-task learning with a focus on modeling task dependencies at multiple levels using attention mechanisms. The title mentions \"Learning to Transfer via Modelling Multi-level Task Dependency,\" so the key contributions should be around capturing both general and data-specific task relationships.\n\nLooking at the reviewers' comments, there are several red flags. Reviewer 1 points out significant grammar issues and a lack of clarity in distinguishing between general and data dependencies. The reviewer also notes that the improvements over SOTA are only slight, which might mean the method isn't a major breakthrough. \n\nReviewer 2 mentions that the motivation for using sample-dependent task relatedness isn't clearly explained. They also highlight experimental concerns, like using multi-label datasets where inputs might overlap between train and test, which could skew results. Additionally, the experiments don't include a baseline without attention, making it hard to isolate the contribution of the attention mechanism. The paper's presentation is also criticized for being hard to follow, with notation issues and unclear figures.\n\nReviewer 3 brings up a critical point: the claim that most existing methods assume tasks are highly correlated isn't accurate. Many modern multi-task models already learn task dependencies. Also, the method's architecture uses separate encoders for each task, which could lead to high parameter counts, especially with many tasks. The reviewer also notes that attention in multi-task learning isn't new, so comparisons with related works (like \"End-to-end multi-task learning with attention\") are missing. There's a typo mentioned too, which adds to the presentation issues.\n\nReviewer 4 is the most damning. They point out that the paper ignores prior work like Taskonomy (2018), which already models task relationships and task affinity matrices. This is a major oversight because the core idea of the paper seems to overlap with existing work. The reviewer also criticizes the lack of details in the method, especially around the \"general task dependency\" matrix and the Transfer Block. The notation in equations is confusing, and terms like \"multi-level\" vs \"multi-view\" aren't clearly defined. Without addressing these, the paper's novelty and technical soundness are in doubt.\n\nThe rebuttal didn't resolve these issues. The authors didn't adequately address the prior work problem, and the experimental comparisons are still lacking. The hierarchical justification for their approach (like using text and graph data) wasn't convincing either.\n\nPutting this together: The paper's main contributions aren't novel given existing work like Taskonomy. The method's technical details are unclear, and the experiments are insufficient because they don't compare against relevant baselines. Grammar and presentation issues make it hard to follow. While the idea of data-dependent attention is somewhat new, the lack of proper grounding in prior work and weak experiments hurt its case. For a top-tier conference, these issues are deal-breakers. The reviewers' consensus, especially from Reviewer 4, points towards rejection unless major revisions are made, which the authors haven't done based on the rebuttal.\n</think>\n\nThe paper proposes a multi-task learning framework that models task dependencies at both the general task level and the data-specific level using attention mechanisms. While the idea of addressing task relationships in multi-task learning is relevant, several critical issues undermine its potential for acceptance at a top-tier conference:\n\n### Key Issues:\n1. **Lack of Novelty and Prior Work Omissions**:\n   - **Reviewer 4** highlights that the core concept of modeling task relationships (e.g., task dependency matrices) is not novel, as prior work like *Taskonomy* (2018) already addressed similar ideas. The paper fails to adequately distinguish its contributions from this foundational work, casting doubt on its originality.\n   - The claim that \"most existing methods assume tasks are highly correlated\" is disputed by **Reviewer 3**, who notes that modern multi-task learning frameworks inherently learn task dependencies without such assumptions. This weakens the paper’s motivation.\n\n2. **Technical and Presentation Flaws**:\n   - **Notation and Clarity**: Multiple reviewers (2, 3, 4) point out confusing notation (e.g., conflicting indices in equations), unclear definitions (e.g., \"multi-level task dependency\" vs. \"multi-view\"), and poorly explained components (e.g., the \"Transfer Block\" and \"Point-wise Mutual Attention Mechanism\"). These issues make the method difficult to follow and assess.\n   - **Implementation Concerns**: **Reviewer 3** notes that task-specific encoders could lead to excessive parameters, especially with many tasks, which is a practical drawback not addressed in the paper.\n\n3. **Experimental Weaknesses**:\n   - **Baseline Comparisons**: The experiments lack critical baselines, such as *End-to-end multi-task learning with attention* (as noted by the meta-reviewer) and Taskonomy. Without these, it is impossible to evaluate the method’s superiority over existing approaches.\n   - **Dataset Limitations**: **Reviewer 2** questions the use of multi-label datasets where inputs might overlap between train and test sets, potentially inflating performance metrics. The paper does not clarify this.\n   - **Attention’s Role**: The impact of the attention mechanism itself is not isolated, as no ablation study without attention is provided (as recommended by Reviewers 2 and the meta-reviewer).\n\n4. **Presentation and Grammar**:\n   - Multiple reviewers (1, 2, 3, 4) emphasize severe grammatical errors and poor writing quality, which hinder comprehension. The paper requires substantial proofreading and reorganization.\n\n5. **Rebuttal Failures**:\n   - The authors’ rebuttal did not adequately address the prior work concerns (e.g., Taskonomy) or clarify the method’s technical details. The justification for hierarchical data (text/graph) was deemed unconvincing.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile the paper’s focus on task dependency in multi-task learning is timely, its lack of novelty relative to prior work (e.g., Taskonomy), unclear technical explanations, insufficient experiments, and poor presentation collectively outweigh its potential contributions. For a top-tier conference, these issues are critical and cannot be overlooked. The authors have not demonstrated sufficient innovation or rigor to justify acceptance.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

That's a strong indicator of rejection because top conferences require thorough literature reviews and proper citations.\n\nReviewer 2 emphasizes the writing quality. They had trouble understanding the abstract and the paper's main points. The reviewer mentions grammatical issues everywhere and that the paper doesn't meet basic scientific writing standards. They even couldn't understand key phrases like \"coordination of episode generation\". This is a big red flag because clarity is essential in academic papers. If the reviewers can't grasp the content, the paper fails in communication, which is critical for publication.\n\nReviewer 3 is even more critical. They say the paper is poorly written with incomprehensible passages, no references, undefined math symbols, and structural issues like blank spaces and hard-to-follow algorithms. They question if it's even a serious academic work, comparing it to rough notes. The mention of needing significant work for any venue suggests it's not just a minor fix but a major overhaul needed.\n\nPutting this together: All three reviewers agree on major issues. The lack of references is a serious problem because academic work must situate itself within existing research. The writing quality is so poor that the content can't be understood, which undermines the paper's credibility. Even if the idea has potential, the execution here is too flawed. For a top-tier conference, the standards are high, and these issues would disqualify it. The authors need to address these fundamental problems first, like improving writing, adding references, clarifying methods, and possibly more rigorous experiments beyond a small problem. Since the reviewers can't even discern the method's details, there's no way to evaluate its merits properly. Therefore, rejection is the only viable decision here.\n</think>\n\nThe paper under review faces severe and consistent criticism from all three reviewers, who unanimously highlight critical flaws that render the work unsuitable for publication at a top-tier conference. Here is the detailed analysis:\n\n### Key Issues Identified:\n1. **Lack of Scholarly Rigor**:\n   - **No References**: The paper entirely lacks citations to prior work, which is a fundamental requirement for academic research. This omission undermines its credibility and prevents meaningful evaluation of its contributions relative to existing literature.\n   - **Undefined Terms and Symbols**: Reviewers noted that mathematical symbols and key concepts (e.g., \"coordination of episode generation\") are not properly defined, making the paper inaccessible to readers and reviewers alike.\n\n2. **Poor Writing and Clarity**:\n   - **Grammar and Coherence**: The paper is described as \"badly and unprofessionally written\" with grammatical errors throughout. Reviewers explicitly stated they could not understand critical sections of the abstract and the main text, which is unacceptable for a scientific publication.\n   - **Incomprehensible Content**: Reviewers struggled to discern the paper’s core ideas, methodology, and contributions. For instance, the abstract’s claim about \"regarding the entire system as game tree search\" is not explained, and the proposed method’s novelty and mechanism remain unclear.\n\n3. **Incomplete and Underdeveloped Work**:\n   - **Lack of Methodological Detail**: The paper fails to provide a clear description of the proposed method. Reviewer 3 noted that algorithm boxes are \"very difficult to follow,\" and the writing is so poor that the reviewers could not determine the method’s intent.\n   - **Superficial Experiments**: The experiments are limited to a \"small problem\" (e.g., Tic-Tac-Toe), which is insufficient to demonstrate the method’s robustness or generalizability. Top-tier conferences expect rigorous evaluation on challenging benchmarks.\n   - **Structural Issues**: Reviewer 3 highlighted structural flaws, such as blank spaces and poor formatting, suggesting the paper is incomplete or hastily prepared.\n\n4. **Failure to Meet Basic Academic Standards**:\n   - The reviewers consistently describe the paper as \"not a serious academic endeavor,\" \"half-baked,\" and \"a set of notes.\" These judgments indicate that the work lacks the depth, polish, and scholarly rigor expected of top-tier publications.\n\n### Evaluation Against Conference Standards:\nTop-tier conferences demand:\n- **Clarity and Precision**: The paper must be clearly written, with well-defined concepts and reproducible methods. This paper fails on all counts.\n- **Scholarly Context**: A thorough literature review and proper citations are essential. The absence of references and engagement with prior work disqualifies the submission.\n- **Technical Soundness**: The method’s novelty, implementation, and evaluation must be rigorously presented. The paper’s lack of detail and superficial experiments fall far short.\n- **Professional Presentation**: The writing quality and formatting are so poor that the content cannot be evaluated fairly.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe paper’s fundamental flaws—poor writing, lack of references, undefined terms, incomplete methodology, and underwhelming experiments—render it unsuitable for publication at a top-tier conference. The reviewers’ consensus that the work is \"not a serious academic endeavor\" and requires significant revision before resubmission further supports this conclusion. While the idea of refining MCTS via MCTS may have merit, the current submission does not meet the minimal standards required for peer review or publication.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

      "response": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to act as an expert reviewer for a top-tier conference and decide whether this paper should be accepted or rejected. Alright, let's start by going through all the provided information carefully.\n\nFirst, the paper's title is \"Depth-Width Trade-offs for ReLU Networks via Sharkovsky's Theorem.\" The keywords include depth-width trade-offs, ReLU networks, chaos theory, and Sharkovsky's Theorem. The abstract mentions that the authors are building on Telgarsky's work, which showed that deep networks can represent certain functions (like triangular waves) with zero error, while shallow networks need exponentially many nodes. The open question Telgarsky posed was about characterizing functions that can't be well-approximated by shallower networks. The authors here connect this to Sharkovsky's Theorem from dynamical systems, focusing on periodic points, especially period 3 which implies chaos. They use eigenvalue analysis of dynamical systems associated with these functions.\n\nNow, looking at the reviewer comments. Reviewer 1 is very positive, even saying they can't raise their score because it's already maxed. Reviewer 2 also praises the paper, calling it a delight to read, and says the proofs are correct and the result answers Telgarsky's open question. They do ask two questions: about bias terms affecting lower bounds and intuition for the sharpness of the lower bound, maybe with a synthetic dataset plot. Reviewer 3 is also positive but has some structural concerns. They think the paper starts with too much theory before getting to the main point, suggesting moving Theorem 4.1 earlier. Also, they note that while the period-dependent lower bound is nice, it's not very practical because assessing the period in real tasks is hard. They also mention needing more intuition for some definitions, like Definition 3.\n\nSo, the main strengths are clear: the paper addresses an important open question, uses a novel connection between neural networks and Sharkovsky's Theorem, has solid theoretical contributions with correct proofs, and is well-written. The reviewers are mostly positive, especially Reviewer 2 who is a strong advocate. The weaknesses are structural issues (overloading with theory early on) and practical applicability of the results. The questions from Reviewer 2 about bias terms and intuition for sharpness are valid but not critical for acceptance, as the reviewer noted they're just curious. Reviewer 3's point about the period being hard to assess in practice is a valid concern, but the paper is theoretical, so maybe that's acceptable for a top conference.\n\nTop-tier conferences usually prioritize groundbreaking theoretical contributions, especially when they answer open questions and introduce novel connections. The fact that they linked Sharkovsky's Theorem (from dynamical systems) to neural network expressivity is a significant contribution. The structural issues can be addressed in the final version, like reorganizing sections to present the main theorem earlier. The lack of practical application might be a downside, but the theoretical depth is strong enough. The authors have already addressed some points in their responses, and the reviewers didn't raise any critical flaws. The questions posed by Reviewer 2 are more about extensions or additional insights, which aren't necessary for acceptance. \n\nTherefore, considering the high quality of the theoretical work, the resolution of an open problem, and the positive reviews (with minor suggestions for improvement), the paper should be accepted. The structural issues are fixable in the camera-ready version, and the theoretical contribution is substantial enough for a top conference.\n</think>\n\nThe paper addresses a significant open question in the theoretical foundations of deep learning by connecting depth-width trade-offs in ReLU networks to Sharkovsky’s Theorem from dynamical systems. The authors demonstrate a novel and non-trivial link between periodic points (via Sharkovsky’s ordering) and the representational power of neural networks, providing a clean theoretical framework to characterize when depth is necessary for representing certain functions. This work builds on Telgarsky’s foundational results but goes further by identifying a fundamental reason (periodic points) why some functions resist efficient shallow representation. The proofs are rigorous, and the exposition is clear, with Reviewer 2 explicitly praising the clarity and correctness of the arguments. \n\n**Strengths:**  \n1. **Theoretical Contribution:** The paper resolves an open question posed by Telgarsky by introducing a novel connection between neural network expressivity and Sharkovsky’s Theorem. This is a major theoretical advance, particularly for understanding depth’s role in representational power.  \n2. **Novelty:** The application of Sharkovsky’s Theorem and dynamical systems theory to neural networks is highly original and bridges two distinct areas of mathematics.  \n3. **Technical Soundness:** Reviewers 2 and 3 confirm the proofs are correct and well-structured, with Reviewer 2 calling the result \"clean\" and \"strong.\"  \n4. **Impact:** The work provides a new lens for analyzing depth-width trade-offs, which could inspire future research in theoretical deep learning.  \n\n**Weaknesses and Concerns:**  \n1. **Structural Issues:** Reviewer 3 notes the paper overloads on theoretical background before presenting its main contributions. While this could be improved, it does not fundamentally undermine the work’s validity.  \n2. **Practical Relevance:** Reviewer 3 questions the practical utility of the period-dependent lower bounds, as assessing the period of real-world functions is non-trivial. However, this is a common limitation in foundational theoretical work, and the paper’s primary contribution is conceptual rather than applied.  \n3. **Open Questions:** Reviewer 2’s questions about bias terms and empirical validation are valid but not critical for acceptance. The authors can address these in future work or extended versions.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe paper’s theoretical contributions are substantial, addressing a key open problem with innovative methods. While minor structural improvements and additional intuition could strengthen the presentation, these do not detract from the core value of the work. Top-tier conferences prioritize groundbreaking theoretical insights, and this paper delivers precisely that. The positive reviews from experts in the field further validate its quality.  \n\nFinal Decision: Accept"

      "response": "Okay, let's tackle this. The paper is about showing that SGD can learn one-layer networks in WGANs. The title sounds promising, but the reviewers have some serious concerns. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the main contribution is proving that SGD-Ascent converges to a global solution in polynomial time for a one-layer generator with certain discriminators. The abstract mentions Wasserstein GANs, which typically use Lipschitz-constrained discriminators, often neural networks. But the reviewers point out that the discriminators here are linear and quadratic, which are way simpler than what's used in practice. \n\nReviewer 1 is confused about how quadratic discriminators fit into the WGAN framework. They mention that the data is generated from a teacher network with Gaussian inputs, which might be bounded, but in real scenarios, data isn't necessarily bounded. The authors tried to address this by saying the regularization acts as a Lipschitz constraint, but the reviewer didn't see the revision. Also, the quadratic discriminator isn't used in practice, making the analysis less relevant. The reviewer feels the paper overstates its contribution because the simplified discriminators don't capture the essence of WGANs.\n\nReviewer 2 acknowledges the technical contribution but thinks the simplicity of the discriminators and generator is a major drawback. They argue that using linear/quadratic discriminators removes the \"Wasserstein\" aspect since those can't approximate the Lipschitz functions needed. Also, there's confusion about what a \"one-layer\" network means here. If it's a linear model with a known activation, maybe it's not as impactful. The reviewer thinks the setup is too simplified, making the results not generalizable.\n\nReviewer 3 points out that even with quadratic discriminators, the results only recover joint distributions of two coordinates, not the full distribution. Plus, the analysis can't handle more complex discriminators because of error propagation in gradient ascent steps. The experiments might not be enough to justify the theoretical claims.\n\nPutting this together: The paper's main issue is the choice of discriminators. WGANs rely on complex discriminators (like neural networks) to approximate the Wasserstein distance. By using linear and quadratic discriminators, the problem becomes much simpler and doesn't reflect real-world scenarios. The authors might have made the problem too easy, which limits the practical relevance. The reviewers are concerned that the results don't explain why WGANs work in practice, since their setup is too simplified. \n\nAlso, the terminology confusion (one-layer vs. two-layer) could be misleading. If the generator is essentially a linear model with a fixed activation, that's not the same as a standard one-layer neural network, which might have non-linearities in the hidden layer. This could mislead readers expecting analysis of more complex architectures.\n\nThe technical contributions are valid, but the applicability is questionable. The reviewers agree that the analysis is solid but the setup is too restrictive. Since top-tier conferences require contributions that significantly advance the field and have broader implications, this paper might not meet that bar. The authors didn't address the key concerns about the discriminators adequately, and the simplified models don't align with the WGAN framework's intent.\n\nTherefore, despite the technical merit, the paper's limitations and lack of practical relevance make it a candidate for rejection. The reviewers' points about overclaiming and oversimplification are strong enough to warrant rejection unless the authors can significantly revise, but given the current info, it's better to reject.\n</think>\n\nThe paper presents a theoretical analysis of stochastic gradient descent-ascent (SGD-Ascent) convergence in Wasserstein GANs (WGANs) when the generator is a one-layer network. While the technical analysis appears valid, the reviewers raise critical concerns that undermine the paper's relevance and impact for a top-tier conference:\n\n1. **Overly Simplified Discriminators**:  \n   The paper focuses on linear and quadratic discriminators, which are far simpler than the neural network discriminators used in practical WGANs. Reviewers argue that these discriminators fail to capture the essence of WGANs, which rely on Lipschitz-constrained neural networks to approximate the Wasserstein distance. The quadratic discriminator, in particular, is not used in practice and lacks the expressiveness needed to model complex distributions. This simplification reduces the problem to a setting that is too trivial to explain why WGANs succeed in real-world scenarios.\n\n2. **Misleading Contributions**:  \n   The title and abstract claim to analyze WGANs, but the results apply only to highly restricted discriminators. Reviewers note that the analysis of linear/quadratic discriminators is unlikely to extend to neural networks, making the contributions less impactful. The paper’s focus on recovering marginal or pairwise joint distributions (via quadratic discriminators) also falls short of the broader goal of learning the full joint distribution, which is central to GANs.\n\n3. **Terminology and Scope Issues**:  \n   The term \"one-layer network\" is ambiguous. If the generator is a linear model with a fixed activation (e.g., a linear transformation followed by a known nonlinearity), it is not a standard neural network. This ambiguity risks misleading readers expecting analysis of more complex architectures. Additionally, the data generation setup (Gaussian inputs to a teacher network) is artificial and does not reflect real-world unbounded datasets, further limiting generalizability.\n\n4. **Failure to Address Key Concerns**:  \n   Reviewers highlight that the authors did not adequately address critiques about the discriminators’ relevance to WGANs or the lack of analysis for neural network discriminators. The quadratic discriminator’s connection to the Lipschitz constraint remains unclear, and the paper does not explore how its results might extend to more realistic settings.\n\n5. **Limited Practical Relevance**:  \n   While the technical analysis is sound, the paper’s narrow focus on simplified models and discriminators does not advance the understanding of why SGD-Ascent works for WGANs in practice. The results are more of a theoretical curiosity than a meaningful step toward explaining real-world GAN training.\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nThe paper’s contributions, while technically correct, are overly constrained and fail to address the core challenges of WGANs. The simplifications (e.g., linear/quadratic discriminators) render the analysis disconnected from practical applications, and the authors do not sufficiently justify or contextualize these choices. For a top-tier conference, the work lacks the breadth, relevance, and impact required to justify acceptance.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

      "response": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate whether this paper should be accepted or rejected for a top-tier conference. I need to go through all the provided information carefully.\n\nStarting with the paper's title and abstract. The main idea is using RNNs, specifically bidirectional LSTMs, to predict DNA folding patterns in Drosophila. They compare with linear models and gradient boosting, and the LSTM does better. The key contributions seem to be applying RNNs here and showing the importance of sequential data through memory.\n\nNow, looking at the reviewer comments. There are three reviewers, each with their points. Let me go through each one.\n\nReviewer 1 is concerned about the comparison. They mention that the improvement might be due to the new loss function (weighted MSE) rather than the LSTM itself. The reviewer suggests that other models should also be tested with the same loss to see if the LSTM's advantage holds. Also, the loss function's parameter (why 11?) isn't explained, and there's a lack of generalizability shown beyond the specific dataset and features.\n\nReviewer 2 points out several minor issues like unclear equations, typos (like [5] in the text), figure labels, and a lack of discussion comparing regression vs. neural networks. They also note an interesting part about training vs test errors but want more explanation there. The main concerns here are clarity and some methodological points.\n\nReviewer 3 is more critical. They argue the paper isn't novel enough, lacks clear descriptions of data and methods, and the evaluation is weak. The main points here are: similarity to prior work (without citations), unclear feature representation (like what 20kb means), unclear motivation for using biLSTM (link to DNA's double-stranded nature?), not comparing with other models like CNNs, using the same loss across all models, and not checking feature importance in LSTM properly. Also, hyperparameter tuning details are missing, and the choice of activation (center vs concatenated states) is questioned.\n\nPutting this together, the paper has some promising aspects but several critical issues. The main issues from the reviewers are:\n\n1. **Lack of Methodological Novelty**: Reviewer 3 says it's similar to existing work without citing them. If the approach isn't novel, that's a big problem for a top conference.\n\n2. **Unclear Comparisons**: The weighted MSE might be the reason for LSTM's better performance, not the model itself. The authors didn't test other models with the same loss, making it hard to attribute success to the model architecture.\n\n3. **Generalizability**: The loss function's parameter (11) isn't justified, and there's no test on other datasets or features (like ATAC-seq instead of ChIP-seq). Top conferences want methods that can generalize.\n\n4. **Clarity and Methodological Flaws**: The data description is vague (features, 20kb meaning?), unclear equations, and lack of hyperparameter details. Also, the motivation for biLSTM isn't well-explained (why double-stranded DNA matters here?).\n\n5. **Evaluation Weakness**: Not comparing with CNNs or other recurrent models, not using standard metrics like R², and not properly assessing feature importance in LSTM.\n\n6. **Potential Overlooking of Prior Work**: If they didn't cite similar studies, that's a red flag for originality.\n\nConsidering top-tier standards, these issues are significant. The paper's main contribution (using RNNs for this task) might not be novel enough if others have done similar things. The methodology has several gaps in explanation and validation. The comparisons aren't fair because the loss function's impact isn't isolated. Without addressing these, the paper might not meet the high bar for acceptance.\n\nHowever, the paper does show that LSTM performs better, which is interesting. But the reviewers' points about methodology and novelty are critical. If the work is just applying existing methods without sufficient innovation or rigorous evaluation, it's probably a reject.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject. The paper lacks sufficient methodological novelty, has unclear comparisons due to loss function issues, insufficient generalization tests, and methodological flaws in data description and evaluation. These issues are too significant for a top conference where high standards are expected.\n</think>\n\nThe paper proposes using bidirectional LSTMs to predict DNA folding patterns in Drosophila melanogaster, demonstrating improved performance over linear models and gradient boosting. However, several critical issues raised by reviewers undermine its suitability for a top-tier conference:\n\n### Key Concerns:\n1. **Lack of Methodological Novelty**:\n   - Reviewer 3 highlights that the work is similar to prior studies without proper citations, suggesting a lack of originality. For a top-tier conference, methodological or conceptual novelty is essential, and the paper does not clearly distinguish itself from existing literature.\n\n2. **Unfair Comparisons and Loss Function Issues**:\n   - Reviewer 1 and 3 note that the weighted MSE (wMSE) loss function may be the primary driver of the LSTM’s performance, not the model architecture itself. The authors did not test other models (e.g., linear/gradient boosting) with the same loss, making it impossible to isolate the contribution of the LSTM. Additionally, the choice of \"11\" in the loss function is unexplained, and its generalizability to other datasets or features (e.g., ATAC-seq) is unaddressed.\n\n3. **Poor Methodological Clarity**:\n   - Reviewer 3 and 2 point out significant ambiguities in the data and methods. For example:\n     - The input features (e.g., how epigenetic marks are represented, whether binary or averaged) and the meaning of \"20kb\" segments are unclear.\n     - The motivation for using a bidirectional LSTM (e.g., its relation to DNA’s double-stranded nature) is not justified, and alternative architectures (e.g., CNNs) are not compared.\n     - Hyperparameter tuning details and the rationale for using the \"center\" LSTM activation (rather than concatenated states) are missing.\n\n4. **Weak Evaluation and Generalization**:\n   - The evaluation relies heavily on a single loss function without standard metrics like MSE or R². The lack of experiments on other datasets or feature types undermines claims of generalizability.\n   - The analysis of feature importance in the LSTM is incomplete (e.g., no comparison to linear models’ feature weights).\n\n5. **Technical and Presentation Flaws**:\n   - Reviewer 2 notes several technical issues: an unclear equation (sum over undefined \"K\"), typos (e.g., \"[5]\"), incorrect figure labels, and poor writing (e.g., informal language in Section 4.3).\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile the paper presents an interesting application of RNNs to DNA folding prediction, the combination of **lack of novelty**, **poor methodological rigor**, **unclear comparisons**, and **insufficient generalization testing** are significant barriers to acceptance at a top-tier conference. The reviewers’ concerns collectively suggest that the work does not yet meet the high standards required for publication in a leading venue. Addressing these issues would require substantial revisions, including clearer methodology, fairer comparisons, and stronger validation.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

      "response": "Okay, let's tackle this. I need to decide whether to accept or reject this paper for a top-tier conference. Let me start by going through all the information provided.\n\nThe paper's title is \"Improved Training of Certifiably Robust Models,\" and the keywords are Convex Relaxation, Certified Robustness, Regularization. The abstract says they propose two regularizers to make convex relaxations tighter, which is important because the gap between certified and empirical robustness is a known issue. Their experiments show better certification bounds than baselines.\n\nNow, looking at the reviewer comments. There are three reviewers, each with different points. Let me parse each one.\n\nReviewer 1 is pretty critical. They point out several technical inaccuracies. For example, on page 2, the paper claims IBP can't handle L2 adversaries, but the reviewer says IBP can with adjusted propagation. That's a factual error. Then, on page 3, the reviewer says the Ehlers relaxation isn't optimal, referencing Anderson et al. So the paper might be misrepresenting existing work. \n\nIn section 4, the reviewer is confused about the equations. They mention that equation O isn't the optimal relaxation but the non-convex problem. The authors talk about equivalence between O and C (the relaxed version), but the reviewer says that's only possible if no ReLUs are ambiguous, which is a restrictive case. The section on minimizing the gap (d) is criticized because it's counterproductive—minimizing d would mean lowering the margin, which is bad. The reviewer also points out that the experiments lack Gowal et al.'s results, which are better, and that improvements might be due to CROWN-IBP rather than their method. Typos and formatting issues are noted too. The reviewer thinks the analysis is confusing and the experiments not convincing enough.\n\nReviewer 2 is also critical but less so. They question the clarity of the problem formulations, like confusing the original problem with the relaxation. They mention that the proposed relaxation might be the same as Fast-Lin, leading to looser bounds, which contradicts the goal. The regularizer's justification is unclear, and there's a concern about whether the found δ* is within the norm ball. The experiments don't clarify if baselines used the same relaxation, and they want to see if the optimal relaxation could do the same. The reviewer is on the fence but leans towards rejection due to unclear theoretical justification and presentation issues.\n\nReviewer 3 is more positive but has concerns. They like the problem and the experiments but note presentation issues and that MNIST is too simple a dataset. They suggest needing more datasets. Their final stance is a weak accept.\n\nSo, the main issues are:\n\n1. Technical inaccuracies (e.g., IBP and L2, Ehlers relaxation not optimal).\n2. Confusion in the theoretical sections (equations O and C, misunderstanding when relaxations are tight).\n3. Experimental shortcomings: missing baselines (Gowal et al.), reliance on CROWN-IBP for improvements, and using only MNIST.\n4. Presentation issues (typos, formatting).\n5. The proposed regularizer's theoretical justification is unclear, and there's a risk it might not be better than existing methods when using optimal relaxations.\n\nThe strengths are the problem's importance, the proposed regularizers, and some experimental results showing improvement over baselines. But the reviewers point out that the baselines might not be the strongest, and the theoretical parts have flaws.\n\nTop-tier conferences require strong technical contributions, clear presentation, and thorough experiments. The paper's theoretical foundation has some errors and confusion, which is a red flag. The experiments are limited in scope (only MNIST) and don't compare against the best baselines (Gowal et al.), which might have better results. The regularizers' effectiveness might be overstated if the gains come from combining with CROWN-IBP rather than their own method.\n\nThe reviewers' opinions are split: Reviewer 1 and 2 lean towards rejection (with 1 being strong), while Reviewer 3 is a weak accept. The key issues are the technical inaccuracies, unclear theoretical sections, and insufficient experiments. These are significant for a top conference. The paper might need more rigorous validation and corrections before acceptance.\n\nTherefore, considering all points, the paper should be rejected. It has potential but the current version has critical flaws in both theory and experiments that need addressing beyond a minor revision.\n</think>\n\nThe paper proposes two regularizers to tighten convex relaxation bounds for certifiably robust models, addressing a known gap between certified and empirical robustness. While the problem is important, several critical issues undermine its suitability for a top-tier conference:\n\n### Key Concerns:\n1. **Technical Inaccuracies**:\n   - The claim that IBP cannot handle L2 adversaries is incorrect (Reviewer 1). This misrepresents existing methods, weakening credibility.\n   - The Ehlers relaxation is inaccurately described as \"optimal,\" ignoring prior work (Anderson et al.) that shows its limitations (Reviewer 1).\n\n2. **Theoretical Confusion**:\n   - The paper conflates the non-convex problem (Eq. O) with its convex relaxation (Eq. C), leading to flawed reasoning about when relaxations are tight (Reviewers 1 and 2). For instance, equivalence between O and C is only possible in restrictive cases (e.g., no ambiguous ReLUs), which is not clearly acknowledged.\n   - The proposed regularizer in Section 4.2 (minimizing the gap *d*) is counterproductive, as it inadvertently reduces margins (Reviewer 1). The theoretical justification for the regularizers is unclear, and their relationship to prior work (e.g., Xiao et al.) is unexplored (Reviewer 1).\n\n3. **Experimental Shortcomings**:\n   - Key baselines (e.g., Gowal et al.) are omitted from Table 1, making comparisons incomplete (Reviewer 1). The experiments rely heavily on CROWN-IBP, raising questions about whether the proposed method’s improvements stem from the regularizers or the underlying framework.\n   - The use of MNIST alone is insufficient for a top-tier conference (Reviewer 3). More complex datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10) are needed to validate generalizability.\n\n4. **Presentation and Clarity**:\n   - The analysis in Section 4 is convoluted and overly abstract, failing to connect theoretical insights to practical implications (Reviewers 1 and 2).\n   - Typos and formatting issues (e.g., missing citations, \"CORWN-IBP\") detract from professionalism.\n\n### Strengths:\n- The problem of improving certified robustness is timely and impactful.\n- The proposed regularizers show some empirical improvement over non-regularized baselines.\n- The idea of aligning relaxations with network behavior is conceptually interesting.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile the paper addresses an important problem, its technical inaccuracies, theoretical ambiguities, and insufficient experimental validation outweigh its contributions. The flaws in foundational claims and comparisons suggest the work is not yet mature for a top-tier venue. Addressing these issues would require substantial revisions beyond the scope of minor conference feedback.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

Let me start by going through all the information provided.\n\nThe paper's title is \"Differentiable Hebbian Consolidation for Continual Learning,\" and the keywords include things like Hebbian learning and synaptic plasticity. The abstract mentions they're addressing catastrophic forgetting by using a method with fast and slow weights, inspired by biological systems. They tested it on some standard benchmarks and an imbalanced version of Permuted MNIST. The key claim is that their method outperforms baselines without extra hyperparameters.\n\nNow, looking at the reviewer comments. There are four reviewers here. Let me parse each one.\n\nReviewer 1 says that while the paper has valid points about existing methods like iCaRL, the empirical evaluation isn't strong enough. Specifically, on Split CIFAR-10/100, their method (DHP Softmax) is outperformed by SI (Synaptic Intelligence) until the final split. They want to see a stronger empirical evaluation, maybe combining with other methods. So the main issue here is that the results aren't convincing enough compared to existing methods, especially on more complex datasets.\n\nReviewer 2 is positive about the approach but has some confusion about the technical details. They mention difficulty following the DHS Softmax description, like the equations and terminology (pre/post-synaptic, indices in equations). They also ask why the Hebbian strategy is only applied to the final softmax layer and whether the method works better with others like EWC. The reviewer is concerned about clarity and the method's standalone performance versus combining with others. They also note that hyperparameters aren't needed, which is a plus.\n\nReviewer 3 is generally positive, especially on the motivation and simplicity of the method. However, they point out two main issues: lack of comparison to other CLS-based approaches and insufficient experimental validation. They suggest testing on more complex datasets like CIFAR or games, not just MNIST variants. The minor issue is an undefined term in the paper. So the main concerns here are the experimental section's limitations and missing comparisons.\n\nReviewer 4 is critical. They mention that while the method is well-motivated, the results on more challenging datasets are weak. The method alone doesn't perform well compared to synaptic consolidation methods like SI, and when combined, it's not much better than those methods alone. They suggest testing on larger-scale datasets like CIFAR-100 or ILSVRC to see scalability and performance in other settings. The conclusion here is a weak reject.\n\nPutting this together, the main points against acceptance are:\n\n1. Empirical results are mixed. On some benchmarks like Split CIFAR, their method underperforms existing methods (SI) until the end. The reviewers are pointing out that the method isn't clearly superior, especially in more complex scenarios.\n\n2. Lack of comparison with other CLS-based methods. The authors mention their approach is different from task-specific methods, but they haven't compared against other CLS-based approaches, which is a gap in the experiments.\n\n3. The method's performance when combined with others (like EWC/SI) doesn't show a significant improvement over those methods alone. This suggests that the contribution might not be additive enough, which is a problem for a top-tier conference where contributions need to be impactful.\n\n4. The experiments are limited to MNIST variants and a vision mixture, but not more challenging datasets like CIFAR-100 or CORe50, which are standard in the field. This makes the evaluation seem insufficient for a top conference.\n\nOn the positive side:\n\n- The method is inspired by biological principles (Hebbian learning, CLS), which is a good angle.\n\n- It's differentiable and easy to implement, as noted by Reviewer 3.\n\n- The introduction of an imbalanced Permuted MNIST is a novel contribution, though maybe not enough on its own.\n\n- The paper is well-written and the idea is novel in its approach.\n\nHowever, the critical issues raised by the reviewers, especially regarding empirical validation and comparisons, are significant. Top-tier conferences require strong empirical results and thorough comparisons. The fact that the method doesn't outperform existing methods on key benchmarks and lacks comparisons with relevant baselines (CLS-based methods) is a problem. Additionally, the method's performance when combined with others doesn't add much, which weakens its standalone value.\n\nThe reviewers' suggestions for more experiments (like on CIFAR-100) and better comparisons are valid. Since the paper is being evaluated for a top conference, the bar is high. The current results don't seem to meet that standard, especially given that the method isn't clearly superior in critical areas and the experiments are limited.\n\nTherefore, considering all these points, the paper might not be ready for acceptance at a top-tier conference. The reviewers' concerns about empirical strength and comparisons are substantial enough to warrant a rejection unless the authors can address them in a major revision, which they might not have had the chance to do here.\n</think>\n\nThe paper proposes a novel approach to continual learning using Differentiable Hebbian Consolidation, inspired by biological principles of synaptic plasticity. While the method is well-motivated and introduces an imbalanced variant of Permuted MNIST, several critical issues raised by reviewers undermine its competitiveness for a top-tier conference:\n\n1. **Empirical Weakness**: \n   - On benchmarks like Split CIFAR-10/100, the proposed method (DHP Softmax) underperforms established methods like Synaptic Intelligence (SI) until the final split. This suggests limited effectiveness on more complex datasets.\n   - When combined with other methods (e.g., EWC/SI), the gains are marginal compared to those methods alone, reducing its standalone value.\n\n2. **Incomplete Comparisons**:\n   - The paper lacks comparisons with CLS-based continual learning approaches, despite framing its method as distinct from task-specific methods. This omission weakens the novelty and impact claims.\n   - Experiments are limited to MNIST variants and a vision mixture, missing standard benchmarks like CIFAR-100 or CORe50, which are critical for demonstrating scalability and robustness in the field.\n\n3. **Clarity and Technical Concerns**:\n   - Reviewers highlight confusion about the technical details (e.g., equations, terminology like \"pre/post-synaptic connections\"), suggesting the paper could benefit from clearer explanations and figures.\n   - The motivation for applying Hebbian learning only to the final softmax layer is under-explained, and the method’s relationship to prior work (e.g., EWC) is unclear.\n\n4. **Lack of Strong Baseline Surpassing**:\n   - While the method claims to outperform baselines, its performance on key benchmarks is inconsistent. For instance, on Split CIFAR-10/100, it lags behind SI, and the finetuning baseline may be too weak to validate superiority.\n\n**Conclusion**: The paper’s contributions are incremental and insufficiently validated against state-of-the-art methods on challenging datasets. The empirical results and comparisons fall short of the high bar set by top-tier conferences, where novel methods must demonstrate clear, significant improvements over existing approaches. While the biological inspiration and simplicity are strengths, the unresolved technical ambiguities and limited experimental rigor prevent it from being competitive at this stage.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

Let me start by going through all the information provided.\n\nThe paper's title is \"Domain Adaptive Multibranch Networks,\" and it's about unsupervised domain adaptation. The abstract says they allow different domains to have different processing paths, which is a contrast to existing methods that use the same operations for all domains. The key idea is that some domains might need more complex processing. The experiments show higher accuracy, and they can handle multiple domains.\n\nNow, looking at the reviewer comments. There are three reviewers. Let me go through each one.\n\nReviewer 1 is generally positive. They mention the motivation is clear, related work is sufficient, and experiments are convincing. But they have some minor comments: linking to more transfer learning techniques outside deep learning, the name \"multi-flow network\" might clash with existing terms, references have backlinks which are confusing, avoid arXiv references, and ensure code is published. These are all manageable issues. The main concerns here are minor.\n\nReviewer 2 says the idea isn't novel in adaptive computation but its application to domain adaptation is novel. They point out that the paper claims different computations per domain but actually uses the same number of layers for all domains. That's a problem because the core idea is that some domains need more computation. The experiments only compare with RPT and DANN, which aren't state-of-the-art. Also, Figure 4 shows no parameter sharing at the end, which is counter-intuitive and needs explanation. The reviewer thinks the method is somewhat novel and works, but the experiments are incomplete.\n\nReviewer 3 is more critical. They like the idea of adaptive pipelines but say experiments are insufficient. They want comparisons with state-of-the-art methods like CDAN, not just DANN. Also, missing ablation studies: how many flows (K) is optimal, different configurations, hyperparameters. They also mention that the baseline results are lower than reported in other papers, which is a red flag. The paper didn't test multi-source or multi-target scenarios, which the method could handle. The reviewer thinks without these experiments, the paper isn't strong enough.\n\nSo, the main issues from the reviewers are:\n\n1. **Experimental Insufficiency**: \n   - Not comparing with current SOTA methods (like CDAN instead of just DANN and RPT).\n   - Lack of ablation studies (number of flows, configurations, hyperparameters).\n   - Baseline results are lower than expected, which might indicate issues with implementation or methodology.\n\n2. **Core Idea Flaws**:\n   - The method claims different computations per domain but uses the same number of layers. This contradicts the main motivation. The authors need to address this by varying the computation depth in experiments.\n\n3. **Technical Concerns**:\n   - The name \"multi-flow\" might be confusing due to existing terminology (flow networks in algorithms).\n   - The final model not sharing parameters is counter-intuitive and needs explanation.\n\n4. **Presentation Issues**:\n   - References with backlinks are confusing.\n   - Use of arXiv references instead of peer-reviewed ones.\n\n5. **Code Availability**:\n   - Reviewer 1 is concerned about code being published properly.\n\nNow, considering the standards of a top-tier conference, the experiments are a big issue here. The paper's main contribution is the adaptive computation paths, but without showing that different domains actually have different computations (like varying layers), the core idea isn't properly validated. Also, not comparing to SOTA methods like CDAN makes it hard to assess the method's effectiveness. The ablation studies are missing key elements that would solidify the claims. The lower baseline results also raise questions about the experiments' thoroughness.\n\nOn the positive side, the idea is novel in applying adaptive computation to domain adaptation, and the method seems technically sound. The reviewers agree it's an interesting approach but the experiments don't back it up sufficiently. \n\nTop conferences usually require strong experimental validation, especially against the latest methods. Since the paper's experiments are lacking in key areas, and there are unresolved issues with the core idea's implementation (same layers for all domains), I think this paper isn't ready for acceptance. The reviewers' points about experiments and comparisons are critical and need addressing before it can be considered for a top venue.\n\nThe authors might have a good idea, but without proper validation and comparison, the paper doesn't meet the high standards required. The reviewers' comments, especially from 2 and 3, highlight significant gaps that could prevent acceptance unless revised. Since the user is asking for a decision based on the current information, and the revisions aren't provided, the conclusion would be to reject unless these issues are fixed. Since the question is about the current state, the decision should be to reject.\n</think>\n\nThe paper proposes a novel approach to unsupervised domain adaptation by allowing different domains to follow distinct computational paths in a deep learning framework. While the core idea is innovative and addresses an important problem, several critical issues raised by reviewers undermine its readiness for a top-tier conference:\n\n### Key Strengths:\n1. **Novelty**: The concept of adaptive computation paths tailored to domain-specific needs is novel and addresses a gap in existing domain adaptation methods that enforce uniform processing.\n2. **Technical Soundness**: The method is technically feasible and shows improved accuracy in experiments.\n3. **Potential Scalability**: The framework can handle multiple domains, offering flexibility for multi-source/multi-target scenarios.\n\n### Major Concerns:\n1. **Experimental Insufficiency**:\n   - **Lack of SOTA Baselines**: The paper only compares with outdated methods (RPT, DANN) instead of state-of-the-art techniques like CDAN. This makes it impossible to assess whether the proposed method truly outperforms current best practices.\n   - **Missing Ablation Studies**: Critical parameters such as the number of parallel flows (K), computational unit configurations, and hyperparameter sensitivity are not explored. Without these, the method’s design choices and robustness remain unproven.\n   - **Baseline Performance Issues**: The reported baseline results are lower than those in prior work, suggesting potential implementation flaws or incomplete experimental setups.\n\n2. **Core Idea Flaws**:\n   - The paper claims that domains may require different computational depths but uses the same number of layers for all domains in experiments. This directly contradicts the central motivation, weakening the validity of the proposed approach.\n   - The final model’s lack of parameter sharing (as shown in Figure 4) is counterintuitive and requires deeper explanation to justify its behavior.\n\n3. **Technical and Presentation Issues**:\n   - The term \"multi-flow network\" risks confusion with existing \"flow networks\" in algorithmics.\n   - References with backlinks are unconventional and distracting.\n   - Overuse of arXiv citations undermines rigor, and code availability is uncertain.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile the paper introduces an interesting concept, the experimental shortcomings, incomplete comparisons, and unresolved contradictions between the proposed method and its implementation are significant barriers to acceptance at a top-tier conference. The lack of rigorous validation against state-of-the-art methods and the failure to demonstrate the core idea’s key premise (variable computational depth) are particularly critical. These issues suggest the work is not yet mature enough for publication without substantial revisions.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

      "response": "Okay, let's tackle this. I need to decide whether to accept or reject this paper for a top-tier conference. Let me start by going through all the provided information carefully.\n\nFirst, the paper's title is NORML: Nodal Optimization for Recurrent Meta-Learning. The abstract mentions that it's a novel meta-learning framework using an LSTM-based meta-learner to perform neuron-wise optimization on a learner network. The key points they highlight are the linear scaling of meta-learner parameters with the learner's parameters, and that their experiments show the LSTM learns effective updates beyond just feature reuse.\n\nNow, looking at the reviewer comments. There are three reviewers, each with their own points. Let me parse each one.\n\nReviewer 1 points out that the paper's contribution relative to Ravi & Larochelle's work might not be as novel as claimed. They mention that Ravi & Larochelle also used parameter sharing in their LSTM meta-learner, which actually keeps the meta-learner's parameters constant relative to the learner's size. The authors here claim their approach avoids the scaling problem, but Reviewer 1 says that's not accurate because Ravi's method already does that. So the main contribution might be overstated. Also, the experiments don't compare fairly with Ravi's method under the same settings, which is a problem. The experiments on Mini-ImageNet don't include Sun et al.'s results, which actually perform better, and the Omniglot experiment uses a fully-connected network instead of the standard convolutional one, making comparisons with prior work (like MAML) less meaningful. Additionally, the claim about handling many inner-loop steps isn't supported because their experiments use few steps. So the experiments are not convincing enough.\n\nReviewer 2's comments are more about writing quality. They mention the paper is poorly written with many grammatical errors, inconsistent citations, and flow issues. The technical content has some inaccuracies, like misrepresenting prior work (e.g., Andrychowicz's method). The writing needs a major overhaul, which is a big red flag for a top conference. Also, the theoretical novelty is minimal, which is a problem for acceptance.\n\nReviewer 3 also points out limited novelty, stating that the method is an incremental improvement over Ravi & Larochelle. They didn't do a fair comparison because the baselines use different architectures (like ResNet-12 vs. their own). The paper's experiments are on fully-connected networks, which limits applicability since most few-shot methods use convolutions. There are also inaccuracies in describing prior work, like claiming Andrychowicz uses separate LSTMs per parameter, which isn't true. The method might actually use different LSTMs per layer, contradicting their own claims. Technical issues like missing confidence intervals and unclear gradient handling (first-order vs. second-order) are also noted.\n\nPutting this all together, the main issues are:\n\n1. **Novelty and Contribution**: The key contribution (scaling of parameters) is not as novel as claimed because prior work (Ravi & Larochelle) already addressed scaling through parameter sharing. The authors didn't properly compare with this method under the same conditions, making it hard to assess their improvement.\n\n2. **Experimental Weaknesses**: \n   - Missing baselines (Sun et al., MAML++), especially on Mini-ImageNet.\n   - Omniglot experiments not using standard architectures, making comparisons with MAML unfair.\n   - Claims about handling many inner-loop steps aren't supported by experiments with few steps.\n   - Limited applicability to convolutional networks, which are standard in few-shot learning.\n\n3. **Writing and Presentation**: Major issues in writing quality, grammar, citations, and flow. This is critical for a top conference where clarity and presentation are important.\n\n4. **Technical Inaccuracies**: Misrepresentation of prior work (Ravi, Andrychowicz) and internal inconsistencies in the method's description (e.g., LSTM per layer vs. single LSTM).\n\nConsidering top-tier conference standards, these issues are significant. The lack of a fair comparison with key prior work undermines the contribution's validity. The experiments are not robust enough, and the writing质量问题 would distract from the content. While the idea might have merit, the current submission doesn't meet the required standards in terms of novelty, thorough experimentation, and presentation.\n\nTherefore, the decision should be to reject the paper unless major revisions address all these points, which is unlikely given the scope of required changes for a conference submission.\n</think>\n\nThe paper proposes NORML, a meta-learning framework using an LSTM-based meta-learner to optimize a learner network's parameters neuron-wise. While the idea of nodal optimization and linear scaling of meta-learner parameters is intriguing, several critical issues undermine its acceptance at a top-tier conference:\n\n### Key Issues:\n1. **Novelty and Contribution**:\n   - **Overstated Advantages Over Prior Work**: The paper claims to address scaling issues compared to Ravi & Larochelle (2017), but Reviewer 1 and 3 clarify that Ravi & Larochelle already used parameter-sharing techniques to achieve similar scaling. The authors fail to acknowledge this, leading to an inflated novelty claim.\n   - **Lack of Fair Comparisons**: The experiments do not include direct comparisons with Ravi & Larochelle under the same settings (e.g., pre-trained convolutional networks), making it impossible to validate the purported benefits of NORML’s parameter design. Additionally, key baselines like Sun et al. (for Mini-ImageNet) and MAML++ are omitted, weakening the empirical validation.\n\n2. **Experimental Weaknesses**:\n   - **Unrepresentative Benchmarks**: The Omniglot experiments use fully-connected networks instead of the standard convolutional architectures, making comparisons with prior work (e.g., MAML) invalid. This limits the method’s demonstrated applicability.\n   - **Insufficient Inner-Loop Analysis**: The claim that NORML handles many inner-loop steps better than MAML is unsupported, as experiments use few steps. The paper does not address gradient scaling issues over long inner loops.\n   - **Missing Details**: Technical ambiguities (e.g., first-order vs. second-order updates, gradient backpropagation) and missing confidence intervals in Table 2 reduce confidence in the results.\n\n3. **Writing and Presentation**:\n   - **Poor Clarity and Grammar**: Reviewer 2 highlights severe grammatical errors, inconsistent citations, and unclear prose, which are unacceptable for a top-tier venue. The flow of ideas is disjointed, and technical descriptions (e.g., Equation 1’s activation definitions) are ambiguous.\n   - **Inaccurate Descriptions of Prior Work**: The paper misrepresents Ravi & Larochelle’s approach (claiming it requires \"enormous parameters\" when parameter-sharing avoids this) and Andrychowicz et al.’s method (incorrectly stating they use separate LSTMs per parameter). These inaccuracies undermine credibility.\n\n4. **Technical Limitations**:\n   - **Limited Applicability**: NORML is restricted to fully-connected networks, whereas most few-shot learning methods use convolutional architectures. This narrow scope reduces the method’s practical relevance.\n   - **Internal Inconsistencies**: The method’s design (e.g., layer-specific LSTMs vs. a single meta-learner) contradicts its own claims, as noted by Reviewer 3.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile NORML introduces an interesting idea, the paper’s failure to address prior work fairly, its experimental shortcomings, and its significant writing and technical flaws collectively prevent it from meeting the standards of a top-tier conference. The lack of rigorous validation and clarity undermines the contribution’s significance, and the unresolved issues in presentation and methodology make the work unpublishable in its current form.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

Let me start by going through all the information provided.\n\nThe paper's title is \"Learning to Coordinate Manipulation Skills via Skill Behavior Diversification.\" The abstract mentions a modular framework for hierarchical reinforcement learning, where sub-skills are learned individually with diversity, then coordinated. The tasks involve bimanual manipulation and multi-agent scenarios like two robots pushing a box. The authors claim their method outperforms baselines.\n\nLooking at the reviewer comments, there are three reviewers. Let me go through each one's points.\n\nReviewer 1 is generally positive but has some concerns. They mention the problem is interesting and impactful but need clarifications. The main points are:\n\n1. Notations are inconsistent and confusing. Figure 2 needs more details.\n2. The meta-policy selects skills every T_low steps (T_low=1 in Jaco env). This might make skills too short, treated as primitive actions.\n3. High variance in training curves (Figure 4). Need more seeds.\n4. Y-axis in some figures is episode reward but not success rate, making it hard to compare.\n5. Multi-agent baselines could be more recent. Need more discussion on alternatives.\n\nReviewer 2 is more critical. They question the novelty and scientific insight. Key points:\n\n- They ask if temporal abstraction (TA) in multi-agent is different from single-agent. If not, why not just use single-agent methods?\n- Why use DIAYN (a single-agent skill discovery method) in multi-agent? What's unique here?\n- Questions about the pre-defined subtasks and whether prior work exists for multi-agent TA.\n- Technical question about learning q(z|s) for a continuous z.\n- Fixed T_low steps: pros and cons?\n\nReviewer 3 is a weak accept. They like the approach but note limitations:\n\n- The method requires pre-specifying subtasks, which limits applicability.\n- Suggests testing DIAYN alone without predefined subtasks to see if expert knowledge is crucial.\n- Latent skill vector size isn't reported.\n- Recommends a baseline without predefined subtasks.\n\nNow, considering the standards of a top-tier conference. The paper needs to have significant novelty, solid methodology, clear presentation, and thorough evaluation. Let's weigh the pros and cons.\n\nStrengths:\n- The problem is relevant (coordinating multi-agent skills).\n- The approach combines skill diversity (DIAYN) with hierarchical RL, which is a solid idea.\n- Empirical results show better performance than baselines.\n- Applications in both manipulation and locomotion are demonstrated.\n\nWeaknesses:\n- The need for predefined subtasks is a limitation. If the method requires prior knowledge of subtasks, it's less general. The reviewers point out that this might not be scalable or applicable to new tasks without human input.\n- The technical aspects have some issues: notation inconsistency, unclear parts in the algorithm (like the continuous z variable and how q(z|s) is learned), and the fixed T_low might be problematic (if T_low=1, then skills aren't temporally extended, which undermines the hierarchical aspect).\n- The experiments have high variance, and more seeds are needed. The evaluation's clarity is an issue (using episode reward vs. success rate).\n- The baselines could be stronger. Reviewer 3 suggests a DIAYN-only baseline to see if the subtask pre-specification is necessary. If DIAYN alone works as well, the contribution is lessened.\n- The latent vector size isn't reported, which is a detail that affects reproducibility and understanding.\n\nNow, considering the reviewers' recommendations. Reviewer 1 is on the fence but would increase their score if concerns are addressed. Reviewer 2 is skeptical about the novelty and scientific contribution. Reviewer 3 gives a weak accept but points out critical limitations.\n\nTop-tier conferences usually require strong novelty, thorough experiments, and clear presentation. The paper's main contribution is applying DIAYN in a multi-agent hierarchical setup, but the dependency on predefined subtasks is a significant limitation. The technical aspects (notation, T_low, continuous z) need clarification. The experiments have issues with variance and baseline choices.\n\nHowever, the problem addressed is important, and the method shows promise. The authors might address some concerns in the rebuttal, but given the current information, the weaknesses are notable. The predefined subtasks requirement is a key drawback for a top conference, which often values generality and scalability. The lack of a DIAYN-only baseline makes it hard to assess the added value of their approach. The technical ambiguities (like the continuous latent variable handling) also raise red flags.\n\nOn the other hand, the empirical results do show improvement over baselines, and the framework is modular and potentially useful. The reviewers' suggestions for improvements are actionable, but the paper as is might not meet the high bar for acceptance without addressing these points.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject. The paper has interesting ideas but suffers from critical limitations (predefined subtasks, unclear technical aspects, insufficient baselines) and methodological issues that need more rigorous treatment. While improvements could make it stronger, in its current form, it doesn't meet the high standards of a top-tier conference.\n</think>\n\nThe paper proposes a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework for coordinating multi-agent manipulation tasks by first learning diverse sub-skills for individual agents and then training a meta-policy to coordinate them. While the problem is relevant and the approach is conceptually sound, several critical issues undermine its readiness for a top-tier conference:\n\n### Key Strengths:\n1. **Problem Relevance**: The focus on coordinating multi-agent skills for complex tasks (e.g., bimanual manipulation, Ants pushing blocks) is timely and impactful.\n2. **Modular Framework**: The combination of skill diversification (via DIAYN) and hierarchical coordination offers a structured approach to multi-agent control.\n3. **Empirical Results**: The method outperforms baselines in the tested environments, demonstrating practical utility.\n\n### Major Weaknesses:\n1. **Dependency on Predefined Subtasks**: The requirement to pre-specify subtasks limits generalizability. Reviewers question whether this prior knowledge is essential and suggest testing a DIAYN-only baseline to isolate the contribution of predefined subtasks. Without this, the method’s novelty and scalability are weakened.\n2. **Technical Ambiguities**:\n   - **Notation and Presentation**: Inconsistent notation and unclear explanations (e.g., Figure 2’s lack of detail, handling of continuous latent variables) hinder reproducibility and clarity.\n   - **Fixed Temporal Abstraction**: The use of a fixed \\( T_{\\text{low}} = 1 \\) in Jaco environments reduces skills to primitive actions, undermining the hierarchical framework’s value. The authors must justify this design choice.\n3. **Empirical Rigor**:\n   - **High Variance in Results**: Figure 4’s high variance demands more seeds and clearer reporting (e.g., success rates instead of raw rewards).\n   - **Incomplete Baselines**: Multi-agent baselines are outdated (e.g., Lowe et al., 2017), and a DIAYN-only baseline is missing, making it hard to assess the method’s true contribution.\n4. **Novelty Concerns**: Reviewer 2 questions whether the approach meaningfully extends single-agent temporal abstraction (TA) to multi-agent settings. The use of DIAYN—a single-agent method—without addressing multi-agent-specific challenges (e.g., coordination dynamics) raises doubts about the framework’s innovation.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile the paper addresses an important problem and shows promising results, its reliance on predefined subtasks, unresolved technical ambiguities, and insufficient empirical rigor prevent it from meeting the high standards of a top-tier conference. The lack of a DIAYN-only baseline and the unclear handling of continuous latent variables further weaken its contribution. Addressing these issues could strengthen the work, but in its current form, it falls short.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

      "response": "Okay, let's tackle this. The paper is about generating singing voices without scores or lyrics, which is a novel approach. The reviewers have mixed feedback. Let me go through each point.\n\nFirst, the main contributions are the three new tasks: free, accompanied, and solo singer. The problem is new, so that's a plus. But the reviewers point out several issues. \n\nReviewer 1 mentions the evaluation metrics are weak. They use Vocalness and average pitch, but those don't assess singing quality properly. The metrics don't capture melody or lyrics, which are key for singing. Also, the audio samples weren't clear, making it hard to judge.\n\nReviewer 2 says the motivation isn't strong enough. Why these three tasks? They also want comparisons with baselines. Like, using existing methods with estimated scores. The dataset is in-house, which is a problem because existing datasets like MIR-1k could provide cleaner data. The training data description is vague—genres, accompaniments? Also, no baseline models to compare against. The audio samples are better than nothing but not great compared to MelNet. They also mention MelNet isn't cited, which is a minor issue.\n\nReviewer 3 agrees the problem is interesting but the evaluation is too weak. The metrics like Vocalness and average pitch have flaws. CREPE might not be reliable for pitch tracking in this context. The literature review could be better, especially on neural synthesis methods.\n\nReviewer 4 is harsher. They say the paper tries to solve too much at once. The architecture choices aren't justified well—like using BEGAN for sequences without citing relevant work. No ablation studies on components like GRUs. The writing is unclear in some parts. They recommend rejection because of lack of justification, insufficient literature, and unclear writing.\n\nReviewer 5 thinks the approach might be overkill. Why not use MIDI generation and then synthesize? They want a comparison with MIDI-based methods. Also, working in the waveform domain requires source separation, which is a downside not addressed.\n\nSo, the main issues are:\n\n1. **Evaluation**: Metrics are inadequate. They don't assess singing quality (melody, harmony, lyrics). MOS study lacks context without baselines. The authors didn't compare with existing methods even when possible (e.g., using estimated scores).\n\n2. **Baseline Comparisons**: Multiple reviewers point out the lack of baselines. Even if the problem is new, using existing techniques as baselines would help. For example, using AMT to get scores and then applying existing synthesis methods.\n\n3. **Data and Methodology Clarity**: The dataset is in-house with unclear composition (genres, accompaniment types). Training data details are vague, making it hard to assess reproducibility. The architecture choices aren't well-justified (e.g., BEGAN for sequences without proper citations).\n\n4. **Motivation and Focus**: The paper tries to address three tasks without clear motivation for why these are important or how they differ. The solo singer's use of chord sequences seems conflicting with the main goal of being unsupervised.\n\n5. **Writing and Presentation**: Some parts are unclear, like the \"inner idea\" in solo singer. The paper is a bit scattered, trying to cover too much without sufficient depth.\n\nOn the positive side, the problem is novel and the code is provided. The authors made an effort with metrics and audio samples, but the samples aren't well-presented. The core idea is interesting but underdeveloped in terms of evaluation and justification.\n\nConsidering top-tier standards, the paper needs stronger evaluation, clearer methodology, and better justification for choices. Without these, the contributions are hard to assess. The reviewers' consensus leans towards rejection due to these shortcomings, especially the lack of baselines and weak metrics. Even though the problem is novel, the execution and evaluation don't meet the high bar required for acceptance.\n</think>\n\nThe paper proposes a novel approach to singing voice generation without relying on musical scores or lyrics, exploring three distinct scenarios: free, accompanied, and solo singer generation. While the problem is innovative and the authors demonstrate effort in addressing technical challenges (e.g., source separation, adversarial training), several critical issues undermine its readiness for a top-tier conference:\n\n### Key Strengths:\n1. **Novel Problem Space**: The paper introduces a new research direction in singing voice generation, which is inherently interesting and has potential long-term impact.\n2. **Technical Effort**: The authors developed a pipeline involving source separation, transcription, and adversarial networks, and provided code, which is commendable.\n3. **Initial Exploration**: The work serves as a baseline for future research in unconditional singing voice generation.\n\n### Major Weaknesses:\n1. **Evaluation Shortcomings**:\n   - **Metrics**: The proposed metrics (Vocalness, Matchness, average pitch) are insufficient to assess singing quality. They fail to capture melody, harmony, or lyrical coherence, which are central to singing. Reviewers noted that Vocalness relies on a flawed vocal detection tool, and average pitch is an inadequate proxy for musicality.\n   - **Lack of Baselines**: No comparisons with existing methods (e.g., using estimated scores via AMT to synthesize singing voices with prior techniques) are provided. This makes it impossible to gauge the novelty or effectiveness of the proposed approach.\n   - **Audio Samples**: While the samples are non-cherry-picked, their lack of clear labeling and context (e.g., which task they correspond to) hinders meaningful evaluation. Comparisons to related work (e.g., MelNet) are absent.\n\n2. **Motivation and Clarity**:\n   - The motivation for the three task settings is underdeveloped. The paper does not clearly articulate why these scenarios are important or how they differ in value.\n   - The \"solo singer\" approach introduces chord sequences, which contradicts the core premise of being fully unsupervised (since chords are generated and then used as conditions).\n   - The training data description is vague (e.g., genre diversity, accompaniment types), making reproducibility and domain applicability unclear.\n\n3. **Methodological Flaws**:\n   - **Architecture Justification**: Key design choices (e.g., adapting BEGAN for sequences, loss functions) are inadequately supported by theory or experiments. Citations to relevant prior work (e.g., PatchGAN) are missing.\n   - **Data Preparation**: The reliance on in-house datasets with unclear quality and composition (e.g., mixing genres like jazz and solo piano) raises concerns about bias and generalizability. Existing datasets like MIR-1k could have provided cleaner comparisons.\n   - **Writing and Structure**: The paper is overly ambitious, addressing too many problems (source separation, transcription, generation) without sufficient focus. Sections like the \"inner idea\" of the solo singer are poorly explained, and the prose is occasionally unclear.\n\n4. **Baseline and Domain Gaps**:\n   - The waveform domain introduces complexities (e.g., source separation) that MIDI-based approaches avoid. The paper does not adequately justify why waveform generation is preferable or address this trade-off.\n   - MIDI-based baselines (e.g., generating MIDI with existing models and converting to audio) are not explored, leaving a critical gap in the evaluation.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile the problem of score/lyrics-free singing voice generation is intriguing, the paper falls short in rigorously addressing core challenges. The lack of meaningful baselines, inadequate metrics, and unclear methodology prevent a definitive assessment of the work’s contributions. For a top-tier conference, the evaluation and technical justification must be significantly stronger to justify acceptance. The reviewers’ concerns about motivation, reproducibility, and comparison with existing methods are not adequately addressed, and the paper’s current state risks being seen as exploratory rather than impactful.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

      "response": "Okay, let's tackle this. I need to decide whether this paper should be accepted or rejected for a top-tier conference. Let me start by going through all the provided information carefully.\n\nFirst, the paper's title is \"Defense against Adversarial Examples by Encoder-Assisted Search in the Latent Coding Space.\" The keywords are adversarial defense, auto-encoder, adversarial attack, GAN. The abstract mentions they propose AE-GAN+sr, which uses an autoencoder with adversarial loss to form a latent space. During inference, they search the latent space to find the closest natural reconstruction, starting from the encoder's output. They claim it's robust with less computation than Defense-GAN.\n\nNow, looking at the reviewer comments. There are four reviewers here. Let's go through each one.\n\nReviewer 1 says the method is an alternative to Defense-GAN, which is a prior work. They note that while the method is computationally cheaper, it sacrifices some accuracy. However, with fewer iterations and a single starting point, it outperforms Defense-GAN. So there's a trade-off here. The experiments are on MNIST and F-MNIST, which are simpler datasets. The reviewer thinks the performance is reasonable but maybe not groundbreaking.\n\nReviewer 2 is more critical. They point out that the contribution is too incremental. The paper doesn't compare with state-of-the-art defenses like PGD adversarial training or TRADES. They mention that the Szegedy baseline is obsolete, which is a problem because using outdated baselines can make the results look better than they are. Also, there are typos and the paper is over the page limit. The figure (Fig.4) is unclear regarding false alarms. These are significant issues for a top conference.\n\nReviewer 3 raises concerns about the method's reliance on the autoencoder's detection ability, which might be vulnerable to white-box attacks. They also question the autoencoder's capacity on more complex datasets. The reviewer points out that the discriminator in the GAN might not see true data reconstructions, leading to inconsistent decoder behavior. Additionally, the results show better performance on stronger attacks than weaker ones, which is counterintuitive and needs explanation. These are valid points about the method's robustness and evaluation.\n\nReviewer 4's main points are about the writing quality and experiments. The paper is hard to follow with unclear descriptions of the model and training process. The experiments are on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST, which are not as challenging as CIFAR-10. The results don't convincingly outperform baselines like Defense-GAN or adversarial training. The reviewer also asks specific questions about the implementation details of the encoder-assisted search and how it compares to BiGAN. The decision here is to reject, citing writing issues and insufficient experiments.\n\nPutting this all together, the key issues are:\n\n1. **Incremental Contribution**: Reviewer 2 and 3 suggest that the method is a refinement of existing work (Defense-GAN) without enough novel elements. The main claim is reducing computational cost, but the experiments don't show a clear advantage over newer state-of-the-art methods like PGD or TRADES, which weren't tested. This makes the contribution seem minor.\n\n2. **Experimental Weakness**: The experiments are limited to MNIST and Fashion-MNIST. Top-tier conferences usually require evaluation on more complex datasets like CIFAR-10 or ImageNet. The lack of comparison with stronger baselines (PGD, TRADES) is a big red flag. Also, the results on stronger vs weaker attacks being inconsistent need addressing.\n\n3. **Writing and Presentation**: Multiple reviewers (2, 4) note poor writing quality—typos, unclear explanations, and exceeding the page limit. The paper's clarity is important for reproducibility and understanding, especially in a competitive conference.\n\n4. **Technical Concerns**: Reviewer 3's points about the autoencoder's detection vulnerability and the GAN's latent space assumptions are valid. If the autoencoder can be fooled by white-box attacks, the defense isn't robust. Also, the discriminator's training might not ensure the latent distribution aligns with the prior, which could affect performance.\n\n5. **Implementation Details**: Reviewer 4's questions about how the encoder-assisted search works in practice (number of steps, pre-training vs. online optimization) weren't addressed in the paper. Without clear details, it's hard to assess the method's validity and practicality.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the paper's main issues are the incremental nature of the contribution, insufficient experiments against strong baselines, and poor writing. While the method shows some promise in reducing computation compared to Defense-GAN, the lack of comparison with more recent and effective defenses undermines its significance. The technical concerns about robustness and the unclear implementation details add to the doubts. The writing issues, including typos and overlength, suggest the paper isn't polished enough for a top conference.\n\nTop-tier conferences require high standards in both technical novelty and presentation. Since the paper's contributions are incremental, experiments are limited, and there are significant writing issues, it's likely that the paper doesn't meet the bar for acceptance. The reviewers' consensus leans towards rejection, especially with the strong arguments from Reviewers 2 and 4 about the lack of SOTA comparisons and clarity.\n</think>\n\nThe paper proposes AE-GAN+sr, an adversarial defense method that combines autoencoders and GANs to purify inputs via latent space search. While the approach shows promise in reducing computational costs compared to Defense-GAN, several critical issues undermine its suitability for a top-tier conference:\n\n### Key Concerns:\n1. **Incremental Contribution**:  \n   - Reviewers 2 and 3 highlight that the method is a refinement of prior work (Defense-GAN) without sufficient novelty. The core idea of using an encoder to initialize latent space search is not novel, and the claimed computational efficiency comes at the cost of accuracy. The paper fails to compare with state-of-the-art defenses like PGD adversarial training or TRADES, relying instead on outdated baselines (e.g., Szegedy). This weakens the significance of the contribution.\n\n2. **Experimental Limitations**:  \n   - Experiments are confined to MNIST and Fashion-MNIST, which are simpler datasets. Top-tier conferences require evaluation on more challenging datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10). Additionally, the inconsistent performance on stronger vs. weaker attacks (noted by Reviewer 3) raises questions about the method’s robustness and requires further analysis. The lack of comparisons with modern defenses invalidates claims of superiority.\n\n3. **Technical Flaws and Uncertainties**:  \n   - The autoencoder’s detection mechanism is vulnerable to white-box attacks (Reviewer 3). The GAN’s discriminator does not see true data reconstructions, risking inconsistent decoder behavior. The paper also lacks clarity on latent space alignment between data distribution and prior, which is critical for the method’s success.  \n   - Implementation details (e.g., number of search steps, pre-training vs. online optimization) are poorly explained, making reproducibility difficult (Reviewer 4).\n\n4. **Writing and Presentation**:  \n   - Multiple reviewers (2, 4) note significant writing issues: typos, grammatical errors, and exceeding the page limit. The paper is \"hard to follow\" and lacks clarity in describing the model architecture and training process. These flaws hinder understanding and credibility.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile the paper addresses an important problem and shows some improvements over Defense-GAN in specific scenarios, its incremental contribution, lack of rigorous comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, and technical shortcomings outweigh its merits. The experimental limitations and poor writing further diminish its competitiveness for a top-tier conference. The reviewers’ consensus, particularly from Reviewers 2 and 4, strongly supports rejection due to insufficient novelty, weak experiments, and subpar presentation.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

      "response": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate whether this paper should be accepted or rejected for a top-tier conference. I need to go through all the provided information carefully.\n\nStarting with the paper's abstract. The title is \"Extreme Classification via Adversarial Softmax Approximation.\" The problem they're addressing is extreme classification, which is when you have a huge number of classes. The traditional softmax is too slow because the gradient cost is proportional to the number of classes, C. They mention that uniform negative sampling is used but has slow convergence due to low signal-to-noise ratio. Their solution is an adversarial sampling method using a decision tree to mimic the data distribution, which reduces gradient variance and speeds up training. Their contributions are three-fold: adversarial sampling with log(C) cost, a proof about variance reduction, and experiments showing a 10x speedup.\n\nNow, looking at the reviewer comments. \n\nReviewer 1 is positive, saying the paper is well-explained and the method works. They recommend acceptance. But they're not an expert, so maybe their technical depth is limited.\n\nReviewer 2 has more critical points. They note that the paper doesn't discuss prior work on non-uniform negative sampling, like the papers [1]-[4]. That's a problem because if similar methods already exist, the novelty might be questioned. Also, the experiments don't include comparisons with the full softmax on smaller datasets, which is a gap. There are some typos too, like in section 4 and table 1. But the main issue here is the lack of prior work discussion and missing baselines.\n\nReviewer 3 is even more critical. They point out that the experiments are incomplete. The paper doesn't compare against recent state-of-the-art methods like Slice [1] and DiSMEC [2], which are important baselines. Also, the paper doesn't evaluate on other datasets like EURLex or Amazon3M, which are standard in the field. Additionally, they mention that the method might not handle multi-label settings well, which is a common use case in extreme classification. The reviewer also notes that the proposed method's performance on tail-labels (which are important in real-world data) isn't evaluated using metrics like MacroF1. These are significant omissions because without comparing to stronger baselines and testing on more datasets, the paper's claims about superiority aren't fully supported. The fact that DiSMEC might achieve higher accuracy on Wiki500 is a red flag. Also, the paper's baseline (OVE) is suboptimal, making their results look better than they are.\n\nThe authors need to address these points. The key issues are:\n\n1. **Lack of Prior Work Discussion**: The paper doesn't adequately cite and compare with existing non-uniform sampling methods like those in [1-4], which might have similar ideas. This undermines the novelty and contribution.\n\n2. **Incomplete Experiments**: \n   - Not comparing against Slice and DiSMEC, which are state-of-the-art methods.\n   - Not testing on smaller datasets where full softmax could be run for comparison.\n   - Not evaluating on more datasets (like EURLex, Amazon3M) and metrics (MacroF1 for tail labels).\n   - Not addressing multi-label scenarios, which is a common application area.\n\n3. **Technical Concerns**: The adversarial model (decision tree) might have its own computational costs, even if logarithmic. The reviewer points out that some prior works achieve similar sampling costs without needing an auxiliary model, which could be a disadvantage.\n\n4. **Typographical Errors**: While minor, these indicate possible sloppiness in the writing, which is a concern for a top-tier conference.\n\nOn the positive side, the method is technically sound, the idea is interesting, and the experiments do show a speedup. But the lack of thorough comparisons and ignoring key prior work are major issues. Top conferences require strong novelty and comprehensive evaluations. Since the paper doesn't address these, it might not meet the standards. However, if the authors can revise to include those comparisons and fix the omissions, maybe it could be accepted. But given the current state, the reviewers' points suggest that the paper isn't ready yet.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject. The paper has promising ideas but lacks sufficient comparison with existing methods, doesn't address important prior work, and has incomplete experiments. These issues are critical for a top-tier conference where thoroughness and novelty are essential.\n</think>\n\nThe paper proposes an adversarial sampling method for extreme classification to address the computational inefficiency of traditional softmax. While the method shows promise in reducing training time and improving gradient signal, several critical issues arise from the reviewer comments that undermine its readiness for a top-tier conference:\n\n### Key Strengths:\n1. **Technical Contribution**: The adversarial sampling mechanism and its theoretical analysis (gradient variance reduction) are novel and well-explained.\n2. **Practical Impact**: The method achieves a claimed 10x speedup over baselines, which is significant for large-scale applications.\n3. **Clarity**: The paper is praised for its educational presentation, making complex ideas accessible.\n\n### Major Concerns:\n1. **Lack of Prior Work Discussion**:\n   - The paper fails to engage with recent and relevant work on non-uniform negative sampling (e.g., [1-4]), which propose similar ideas (e.g., sampling negatives via approximations of the softmax distribution at logarithmic cost). This omission raises questions about the novelty and differentiation of the proposed method.\n   - The absence of comparisons with state-of-the-art methods like **Slice** [1] and **DiSMEC** [2] weakens the empirical validation. For instance, DiSMEC’s reported 19% accuracy on Wiki500 (vs. the proposed method’s lower performance) suggests potential limitations of the adversarial approach that need addressing.\n\n2. **Incomplete Experiments**:\n   - **Baselines**: The paper does not compare against the full softmax loss (even on smaller datasets) or the computationally intensive but accurate OVE (One-Vs-All) method, making it difficult to assess the trade-off between speed and accuracy.\n   - **Datasets and Metrics**: The experiments are limited to two datasets (Wikipedia-500K and Amazon-670K). Testing on smaller datasets (e.g., EURLex) and larger ones (e.g., Amazon3M) would provide a more comprehensive evaluation. Additionally, metrics like **MacroF1** for tail-label performance are missing, which are critical in extreme classification due to the fat-tailed distribution of labels [3,4].\n   - **Multi-Label Extension**: The paper does not explore whether the method can extend to multi-label settings, a common use case in extreme classification (e.g., AttentionXML [5]). This limits its applicability and comparison with existing methods.\n\n3. **Technical Gaps**:\n   - The adversarial model (decision tree) introduces additional computational overhead, even if logarithmic. Prior works [3,4] achieve similar sampling costs without an auxiliary model, which could be a disadvantage.\n   - The adversarial sampling’s bias correction is mentioned but not empirically validated, leaving room for doubt about its practical effectiveness.\n\n4. **Minor Issues**:\n   - Typographical errors (e.g., in Section 4 and Table 1) suggest a lack of thorough proofreading, which is unbecoming of a top-tier submission.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile the paper’s adversarial sampling idea is innovative and the speedup claims are compelling, the lack of rigorous comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, incomplete experimental validation, and insufficient engagement with prior work significantly weaken its contribution. These issues are particularly problematic for a top-tier conference, where novelty, thoroughness, and contextualization are paramount. The authors must address these gaps in a revised version to justify acceptance.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

      "response": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate whether this paper should be accepted or rejected for a top-tier conference based on the provided information. Let me start by going through all the details carefully.\n\nFirst, the paper's title is \"OBJECT-ORIENTED REPRESENTATION OF 3D SCENES\". The abstract mentions they propose a generative model called ROOTS, which does unsupervised object-wise 3D scene decomposition and rendering. They base it on GQN but add object-oriented representations. The experiments are on 3D room datasets, focusing on disentanglement, compositionality, and generalization compared to GQN.\n\nNow, looking at the reviewer comments. There are four reviewers, and their feedback is mixed but mostly critical. Let me go through each one.\n\nReviewer 1 initially recommended rejection due to poor writing and some incorrect claims. For example, the claim that it's the first unsupervised model to identify objects in 3D scenes is wrong because MONet and Iodine do that in 2D projections. Also, notation issues and lack of clarity in sections like the scene volume map. However, after the rebuttal, they raised their score to 6 (probably a 6/10 scale?) and suggested acceptance if revised. They still want better writing.\n\nReviewer 2 points out that the experiments don't support some claims, like Figure 2 not showing better generations than GQN. Also, the paper is unclear in places, like mentioning \"GoodNet\" without explanation. They also note missing citations for MuJoCo and suggest comparisons with CGQN. The experiments are weak, and there's no ablation study. They can't recommend acceptance in the current form.\n\nReviewer 3 says the paper lacks citations, comparisons with recent works, and ablation studies. They mention that 3D representations like 3D-R2N2 and others exist, which the paper ignores. The hierarchical representation's benefit isn't clear without ablation. The contributions are minor over GQN. They think it's not mature enough for ICLR.\n\nReviewer 4's main issues are method clarity, weak experiments, and insufficient related work. The method is complex and poorly explained, with missing details in the appendix. Experiments don't show significant improvements over GQN, and there's no ablation. The claims about being the first are incorrect. They suggest rejection but mention a possible resubmission after revisions.\n\nPost-rebuttal, the AC (Area Chair) is still leaning towards rejection. They note that even with revisions, the experiments are weak, especially the ablation studies and comparisons. The clarity improved but was still a major issue. The AC is concerned that without proper empirical validation, the claims aren't substantiated. They also mention that the paper's improvements over GQN aren't clearly demonstrated, and some results even show worse performance in some areas.\n\nPutting this all together, the key issues are:\n\n1. **Clarity and Writing**: Multiple reviewers point out poor writing, typos, inconsistent notation, and lack of clarity in explaining the method. Even after revisions, while improved, it's still a concern.\n\n2. **Incorrect Claims**: The \"first unsupervised model\" claim is false, which undermines the novelty. The paper doesn't properly cite related work, especially in 3D scene understanding and object decomposition, making it seem like they're unaware of existing methods.\n\n3. **Experiments**: The experiments don't convincingly show superiority over baselines like GQN. The results in Table 1 show minor improvements, and Figure 2 doesn't support the claims. There's no ablation study to isolate the contributions of each component (like the 3D grid or hierarchical structure). The lack of comparisons with CGQN and other 3D methods is a problem.\n\n4. **Method Explanation**: The method is complex but not well-explained. The appendix lacks details, making it hard to replicate. Terms like STN-INV aren't defined, and figures aren't referenced properly.\n\n5. **Related Work**: The paper doesn't engage with the broader 3D reconstruction and object-centric learning literature, leading to an incomplete context. This makes the contributions seem less impactful.\n\n6. **Ablation Studies**: The absence of ablation studies means we can't tell which parts of the method are essential. Without this, it's hard to assess the validity of the claims about hierarchical representations or object decomposition.\n\nConsidering top-tier conference standards, these issues are significant. Top conferences require strong technical contributions, clear writing, thorough experiments, and proper contextualization within existing literature. Here, the paper's main contributions are incremental over GQN and existing methods, the experiments are underwhelming, and the writing and clarity are problematic. Even with revisions, the AC and reviewers still have concerns about the experiments and the paper's maturity.\n\nThe reviewers' consensus, especially after rebuttal, leans towards rejection. The AC's final note about experiments and the lack of ablation studies being critical points against acceptance. While the method has some novel aspects, the execution and validation fall short of what's expected at a top conference.\n</think>\n\nFinal Decision: Reject\n\n### Detailed Reasoning:\n1. **Clarity and Writing Issues**: Multiple reviewers highlighted significant writing flaws, including grammatical errors, inconsistent notation, and poor explanation of the method. Even after revisions, the clarity remains a concern, with the AC noting that the paper requires substantial rewriting. Top-tier conferences demand polished, accessible writing to ensure reproducibility and broad impact.\n\n2. **Overstated Claims and Lack of Novelty**: The paper’s claim of being the \"first unsupervised model to identify objects in 3D scenes\" is incorrect, as prior works like MONet and Iodine achieve similar tasks in 2D projections. Additionally, the method builds on existing frameworks (e.g., GQN, 3D-R2N2) without sufficiently distinguishing its contributions. The lack of proper citations to 3D reconstruction and object-centric learning literature further undermines its novelty.\n\n3. **Weak Experiments and Empirical Validation**: \n   - The experiments fail to demonstrate clear superiority over baselines like GQN. For instance, Figure 2 does not show the claimed improvements, and Table 1’s marginal gains are insufficient to justify the method’s complexity.\n   - No ablation studies are provided to isolate the contributions of key components (e.g., 3D grid, hierarchical structure), making it impossible to assess which aspects of the model are critical.\n   - Comparisons with relevant baselines (e.g., CGQN, DeepVoxels) are missing, and the object detection experiment lacks baselines (e.g., GQN) for context.\n\n4. **Methodological Gaps**: \n   - The method’s complexity is not matched by thorough explanations. Key components (e.g., STN-INV, f_{3D→2D}) are undefined or poorly documented in the appendix, hindering reproducibility.\n   - The paper does not address fundamental questions, such as why a Gaussian distribution is used for object positions or how the model handles missing objects in context images.\n\n5. **Related Work Shortcomings**: The paper neglects extensive prior work in 3D scene understanding (e.g., voxel-based methods, multi-view stereo) and object-centric learning, leading to an incomplete narrative. This weakens the paper’s positioning and perceived impact.\n\n6. **AC and Reviewer Consensus**: Despite revisions, the AC and reviewers remain unconvinced of the paper’s experimental rigor and maturity. The AC explicitly notes that the experiments are \"weak\" and that the lack of ablation studies undermines the claims. The consensus leans toward rejection due to these unresolved issues.\n\nIn conclusion, while the paper proposes an interesting direction in object-oriented 3D scene representation, its execution falls short of the standards required for a top-tier conference. Significant improvements in clarity, empirical validation, and contextualization are necessary before reconsideration."

Let me start by going through all the details carefully.\n\nFirst, the paper's title and abstract. The main idea is about weakly-supervised trajectory segmentation for learning reusable skills. The key points are using multiple instance learning (MIL) without needing segmentation or ordering labels, and they test on various environments. The abstract mentions zero-shot transfer, which is a big plus if true.\n\nNow, looking at the reviewer comments. There are three reviewers, each with their own concerns. Let me break them down one by one.\n\nReviewer 1 is pretty critical. They say the paper is misleading because the framing and motivation don't match the results. The method gives per-timestep labels but doesn't show how these can be used for reusable skills. They mention that the experiments are limited in scope, with only 4-6 skills per environment. The reviewer also points out that the experiments lack details on setup, number of demos, architecture, and hyperparameters. The lack of analysis on segmentation consistency over time is a problem too. They also note that the Gaussian smoothing isn't detailed, making it hard to assess reliability. The conclusion is to reject because the claims aren't supported.\n\nReviewer 2 thinks the approach is a good application of MIL but the novelty is low since log-sum-exp pooling isn't new. The results are underwhelming with 35-60% accuracy. They want comparisons to fully-supervised baselines and better experiments on behavior cloning. The success rate of 50% is low, and there's no CCNN baseline reported. They suggest adding more thorough baselines and addressing the temporal aspect. Their recommendation is a weak reject due to lack of novelty and impressive results.\n\nReviewer 3 is concerned about the feasibility when many skills are present. They point out that the dataset requirements aren't addressed, like the example where some skills can't be learned. The classification results are poor, and metrics like confusion matrices are missing. They also mention the need for qualitative results and comparisons with unsupervised methods. The dial jaco video's smooth predictions might be due to filtering without proper justification. They also want to see theoretical bounds on when the method works. Their conclusion is to reject due to insufficient evidence of effectiveness.\n\nPutting this together, the common issues are:\n\n1. **Lack of Clear Connection Between Method and Motivation**: The paper claims to learn reusable skills but doesn't demonstrate their reusability. For example, training policies using the segmented skills isn't shown, which is crucial for the \"reusable\" part. Reviewer 1 and 2 both mention this.\n\n2. **Weak Results and Baselines**: The accuracy numbers are low (35-60%), and there's no comparison to fully-supervised baselines. Without knowing the gap between weak and full supervision, it's hard to judge the method's value. Reviewer 2 and 3 highlight this.\n\n3. **Experimental Limitations**: The experiments are limited in scope (only 4-6 skills, specific environments). The setup details are sparse, making reproducibility an issue. Reviewer 1 and 3 point this out.\n\n4. **Theoretical and Practical Gaps**: The paper doesn't address dataset requirements (like the example given by Reviewer 3) or provide theoretical bounds. This makes the approach's applicability uncertain.\n\n5. **Implementation Details Missing**: Lack of info on architecture, hyperparameters, and how smoothing is applied. Reviewer 1 and 3 mention this.\n\n6. **Qualitative Analysis Lacking**: No confusion matrices, trajectory visualizations, or detailed error analysis. Reviewer 3 emphasizes this.\n\nThe authors might have addressed some points in their responses, but since the user hasn't provided those, I have to go by the reviewers' critiques. The reviewers collectively feel the paper isn't ready for a top-tier conference. The main issues are the lack of strong evidence for the method's effectiveness, insufficient experiments, and the disconnect between the claims and the demonstrated results.\n\nEven though the problem is important, the reviewers agree that the current submission doesn't meet the standards. The novelty is questioned (since log-sum-exp isn't new), and the results aren't compelling enough. The experiments are too limited, and the paper doesn't address critical limitations like dataset requirements or provide necessary baselines.\n\nTherefore, considering all these points, the paper should be rejected. It needs more rigorous experiments, better baseline comparisons, and a clearer demonstration of how the segmented skills are actually reusable. The current state doesn't sufficiently support the claims for a top conference.\n</think>\n\nThe paper proposes a weakly-supervised trajectory segmentation method for learning reusable skills using multiple instance learning (MIL). While the problem of learning reusable skills is important, the reviewers' critiques highlight critical shortcomings that undermine the paper's claims and experimental rigor. Here's the breakdown of the key issues:\n\n### Key Issues Identified:\n1. **Misalignment Between Motivation and Results**:  \n   - The paper frames itself as enabling *reusable skills* for downstream tasks, but the method only provides per-timestep skill labels. Crucially, it does not demonstrate how these labels can be leveraged to train reusable policies (e.g., via behavior cloning or hierarchical control). Reviewer 1 notes that even basic experiments (e.g., training policies conditioned on the segmented skills) are missing, making the \"reusable\" claim unsubstantiated.  \n   - The zero-shot transfer claim is only supported by preliminary evidence (videos), with no quantitative analysis provided.\n\n2. **Weak Results and Baselines**:  \n   - Classification accuracies (35–60%) are low and lack comparison to fully supervised baselines. Without knowing the performance ceiling (e.g., fully supervised), it is impossible to assess the method’s effectiveness.  \n   - Behavior cloning experiments are underwhelming (50% success rate) and lack baselines like Policy Sketches [1], as noted by Reviewer 2. The absence of CCNN baseline results further weakens the analysis.\n\n3. **Experimental Limitations**:  \n   - The experiments are restricted to environments with only 4–6 skills, which may not reflect real-world complexity. The setup details (e.g., number of demonstrations, architecture, hyperparameters) are insufficiently described, hindering reproducibility.  \n   - The method’s temporal consistency is unaddressed: there is no mechanism to ensure smooth skill transitions, and Gaussian smoothing is applied without justification or analysis. Reviewer 1 highlights this as a critical flaw for practical use.\n\n4. **Theoretical and Practical Gaps**:  \n   - The paper does not address dataset requirements for learning skills (e.g., the example provided by Reviewer 3 where certain skills cannot be learned due to dataset structure). Without theoretical guarantees or empirical analysis of such limitations, the method’s applicability is unclear.  \n   - Qualitative analysis (e.g., confusion matrices, trajectory visualizations) is missing, making it difficult to interpret the results. Reviewer 3 points out that the reported accuracies might reflect trivial predictions (e.g., constant labels).\n\n5. **Novelty Concerns**:  \n   - The core idea (log-sum-exp pooling) is not novel, as noted by Reviewer 2. The contribution is framed as an application of existing MIL techniques to trajectory segmentation, but the results do not demonstrate a significant leap in performance or methodology.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile the problem of weakly supervised skill segmentation is valuable, the paper falls short in rigorously validating its claims. The disconnect between the motivation (reusable skills) and the demonstrated results, coupled with weak experimental design, insufficient baselines, and lack of theoretical grounding, undermines its suitability for a top-tier conference. The reviewers’ concerns collectively indicate that the work is not yet mature enough to meet the high standards of a prestigious venue.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

      "response": "Okay, let's tackle this. I need to decide whether this paper should be accepted or rejected for a top-tier conference. Let me start by going through all the provided information carefully.\n\nFirst, the paper's title is \"Multi-Precision Policy Enforced Training (MuPPET): A precision-switching strategy for quantised fixed-point training of CNNs.\" The abstract mentions that they're addressing the problem of long training times for large CNNs by using low-precision training with a multi-level approach, including fixed-point representations. They introduce a precision-switching mechanism based on gradient diversity to decide when to switch precisions. The experiments show a 1.28x speedup on some networks while maintaining accuracy.\n\nNow, looking at the reviewer comments. There are three reviewers, each with their own points. Let me parse each one.\n\nReviewer 1 points out that the paper is interesting but the algorithm's reasoning is too heuristic, especially the switching mechanism. They question why the gradients being co-aligned (low diversity) would mean there's not much to learn. The reviewer also mentions typos and that the justification for AlexNet's switching timing is ad-hoc. They want more details on how the gradient diversity is measured (batch vs. epoch gradients).\n\nReviewer 2 has both positive and negative points. The positives are that the approach is novel in using fixed-point and the gradient diversity metric. However, the negatives are significant. The approach doesn't actually choose the \"most appropriate quantization level\" as claimed, but just fixed levels. The precision levels (8,12,14,16 bits) are not well-explained. The precision-switching policy is confusing, especially the ratio \"p\" and the variable \"y\" in the algorithm. There's a discrepancy in Figure 2 where the switch isn't triggered even when p violates the threshold. The results aren't superior to state-of-the-art; for example, AlexNet and ResNet accuracies are lower than FP32, and compared to [2], the method is more complex but not better. Also, they didn't show training/validation curves, which are standard.\n\nReviewer 3 also has mixed feedback. They like the topic but recommend a weak reject because the dynamic switching isn't shown to be necessary. The introduction isn't clear on contributions. The impact of gradient diversity and parameters like p and threshold isn't isolated. The quantization steps aren't detailed enough for reproducibility. Specific questions about equations and figures, like what SC is in equations 4 and 5, and the difference between n and WL. Minor issues like figure text being too small and unclear terms like \"distribution approach.\"\n\nPutting this together, the main issues seem to be:\n\n1. **Clarity and Explanation of the Switching Mechanism**: Reviewers 1 and 2 point out that the motivation for the gradient diversity metric isn't well-explained. The heuristic feels hand-wavy, especially why low diversity means switching precision. The algorithm's parameters (p, y, gamma) are not clearly defined, leading to confusion. The paper might not have sufficiently justified the necessity of dynamic switching over fixed schedules.\n\n2. **Experimental Results**: Reviewer 2 notes that the results aren't superior to existing methods. The speedup is only 1.28x, which might not be significant enough for a top conference. Also, some networks (AlexNet, ResNet) have lower accuracy than FP32, which is a problem. The comparison to state-of-the-art (like [2]) shows that the method is more complex but not better, which is a red flag.\n\n3. **Technical Details and Reproducibility**: The quantization scheme isn't clearly described. The choice of precision levels (8,12,14,16) isn't justified. The equations and parameters (SC, n vs WL) are unclear, making it hard to reproduce. The figures have readability issues, and key parts of the algorithm (like step 5 in the policy) are not explained.\n\n4. **Contribution Clarity**: Reviewer 3 mentions the introduction doesn't clearly state the novel contribution until the end. The core idea's necessity isn't proven—maybe a fixed schedule could work as well, making the dynamic approach redundant.\n\n5. **Missing Analysis**: The lack of training/validation curves is a problem because they're standard for showing training dynamics. The impact of individual parameters (like p and threshold) isn't isolated, so it's hard to tell what's driving the results.\n\nConsidering top-tier conference standards, the paper needs strong contributions, clear explanations, solid experiments, and reproducibility. Here, the main issues are the heuristic nature of the core mechanism without sufficient justification, unclear technical details, and experiments that don't outperform existing methods sufficiently. The speedup is modest, and accuracy drops in some cases are concerning. The reviewers' points about the necessity of the dynamic approach and the lack of clear superiority over state-of-the-art are critical.\n\nHowever, the paper does propose a novel approach combining multiple precisions and fixed-point training, which is an interesting direction. But the execution and presentation have significant flaws. For a top conference, the bar is high, and these issues might be deal-breakers. The reviewers' recommendations (especially Reviewer 3's weak reject) suggest that while the idea is good, the execution and results aren't strong enough yet.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject\n</think>\n\nThe paper proposes a novel approach, MuPPET, for accelerating CNN training using multi-precision quantization with a dynamic precision-switching mechanism. While the idea of leveraging fixed-point representations and gradient diversity is innovative, several critical issues undermine its suitability for a top-tier conference:\n\n### Key Concerns:\n1. **Heuristic and Unclear Core Mechanism**:  \n   - The precision-switching policy relies on gradient diversity, but its motivation is poorly explained. Reviewers question why low gradient diversity (co-aligned gradients) signals a need to reduce precision, as this contradicts intuition (e.g., small gradients might warrant higher precision). The heuristic is borrowed from prior work but not rigorously justified here.  \n   - Technical ambiguities abound: parameters like \"p\" and \"y\" in the algorithm are undefined, and the discrepancy in Figure 2 (switch not triggered despite threshold violations) suggests inconsistencies in the method’s implementation or description.\n\n2. **Weak Experimental Results**:  \n   - The reported 1.28× speedup is modest for a top-tier conference, especially given that some networks (e.g., AlexNet, ResNet18) achieve lower accuracy than full-precision baselines.  \n   - Comparisons to state-of-the-art (e.g., [2]) show the method is more complex but not superior in performance. This raises questions about its practical value.  \n\n3. **Lack of Clarity and Reproducibility**:  \n   - The quantization scheme is poorly described. Key details (e.g., how scaling factors SC are determined, the relationship between n and WL in equations 4/5) are missing, hindering reproducibility.  \n   - The choice of precision levels (8, 12, 14, 16 bits) is unexplained, and the paper fails to isolate the impact of parameters like \"p\" and thresholds.  \n\n4. **Presentation and Writing Issues**:  \n   - The introduction does not clearly state the novel contribution until the final paragraph, burying the core idea.  \n   - Figures are unreadable (e.g., small text in Figure 1/2), and critical analysis (e.g., training/validation curves) is omitted despite being standard in the field.  \n\n5. **Necessity of Dynamic Switching**:  \n   - Reviewer 3 argues that the dynamic switching mechanism is not shown to be a *necessary* improvement over fixed schedules. The experiments do not rigorously compare MuPPET to simpler baselines (e.g., fixed precision schedules), weakening its claimed advantage.  \n\n### Conclusion:  \nWhile the topic is timely and the idea of multi-precision training is promising, the paper’s heuristic approach, unclear technical details, and underwhelming results relative to state-of-the-art fall short of the high bar for top-tier conferences. The lack of rigorous justification for the core mechanism and insufficient experimental validation further weaken its case.  \n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

Let me start by going through all the provided information carefully.\n\nThe paper's title is \"Deep Interaction Processes for Time-Evolving Graphs,\" and the keywords include deep temporal point process, multiple time resolutions, dynamic continuous time-evolving graph, and anti-fraud detection. The abstract mentions they're using a temporal point process framework with LSTMs and some novel mechanisms like time gates, selection, and attention. The experiments show better performance over existing methods, especially in real-world applications like financial fraud detection.\n\nNow, looking at the reviewer comments. There are three reviewers here. Let me parse each one's points.\n\nReviewer 1 is concerned about novelty and justification of contributions. They point out that the main ideas (LSTM with time gates, stacked LSTMs, attention) are incremental. The ablation studies are insufficient, and they didn't compare with JODIE, a recent baseline. Also, there are some technical questions about the model's components, like how the attention works over time, the role of parameters like K and alpha, and the handling of new nodes in different tasks. The reviewer also mentions notation issues and lack of discussion on why their model performs better.\n\nReviewer 2 acknowledges the problem's importance but questions the novelty since prior work has used similar components (like recurrent networks for intensity functions and temporal attention). They also note a possible error in the log-likelihood formulation and suggest that the model's performance might be due to having more parameters since it's a deep model. They recommend comparing with standard benchmarks like DyRep or NeuralHawkes.\n\nReviewer 3 finds the paper hard to understand, especially regarding how the model handles graph dynamics and computational costs. They want more diagrams or examples to clarify the architecture and its components.\n\nSo, the main issues raised are:\n\n1. **Novelty Concerns**: The contributions are seen as incremental. The use of LSTM with time gates and stacked layers isn't novel enough. The attention mechanism might be a point of novelty but isn't analyzed well.\n\n2. **Lack of Key Baselines**: Missing JODIE is a big issue. Since JODIE is a recent and relevant method, not comparing against it weakens the paper's claims.\n\n3. **Ablation Studies and Analysis**: The ablation studies are too simplistic (just turning components on/off). They need more detailed analysis, like varying K, testing without residual connections, or evaluating the impact of time gates.\n\n4. **Technical Concerns**: \n   - The log-likelihood formula might be incorrect (as per Reviewer 2).\n   - Unclear handling of new nodes in different tasks (interaction prediction vs. classification).\n   - The selection mechanism's role in cell states and embeddings during evaluation.\n   - The subgraph creation method (coloring vs. BFS) and its impact on training order.\n\n5. **Clarity and Presentation**: The paper is hard to follow. Notations are inconsistent, and there's a lack of diagrams or examples. The discussion section is missing insights into why their model works better.\n\n6. **Experimental Setup**: \n   - The model's depth (being a deep architecture) might give it an unfair advantage in parameters.\n   - Need to test on standard benchmarks for fair comparison.\n   - The computational cost and scalability aren't addressed.\n\n7. **Minor Issues**: Formatting like equation numbering and notation consistency.\n\nNow, considering top-tier conference standards, these points are significant. The paper's main contributions are incremental, which is a problem. The lack of comparison with JODIE is a major oversight. The experiments, while showing improvement, might not be robust enough due to parameter differences and missing baselines. The clarity issues and insufficient analysis in ablation studies also hurt the paper's persuasiveness.\n\nHowever, the problem addressed (time-evolving graphs) is important, and the proposed mechanisms (time gates, attention) might have merit. The experiments do show better performance, but without proper baselines and analysis, it's hard to trust the results. The reviewers' technical concerns (like the log-likelihood formula) could indicate potential flaws in the model's foundation.\n\nThe authors need to address these points: add JODIE comparisons, clarify the model's mathematical foundations, provide deeper ablation studies, improve clarity with diagrams, and ensure that their experiments are fair and comprehensive. Since the current version has these critical issues, especially the lack of key baselines and insufficient novelty, I think the paper isn't ready for acceptance at a top conference. It might need more work to strengthen the contributions, experiments, and presentation.\n</think>\n\nThe paper proposes a method for modeling time-evolving graphs using a temporal point process framework with recurrent neural networks (LSTM), time gates, attention mechanisms, and stacked layers. While the problem of dynamic graph modeling is important and the experiments show improved performance, several critical issues undermine its suitability for a top-tier conference:\n\n### Key Concerns:\n1. **Novelty and Justification**:  \n   - The core contributions (LSTM with time gates, stacked LSTMs, and attention) are incremental compared to prior work (e.g., DeepCoevolve, JODIE, and NeuralHawkes). The attention mechanism is the only potentially novel component, but its design and temporal dependency are not sufficiently analyzed.  \n   - The paper fails to justify why stacked LSTMs capture \"multiple time resolutions\" or how parameters like \\( K \\) and \\( \\alpha \\) influence performance. The lack of theoretical or empirical analysis weakens the claims of innovation.\n\n2. **Missing Baselines**:  \n   - The absence of comparisons with **JODIE** (a recent and relevant method for temporal interaction networks) is a major oversight. This omission undermines the empirical validation, as JODIE’s direct prediction of embeddings could be a strong baseline.  \n   - The experiments also lack standard benchmarks (e.g., DyRep or NeuralHawkes datasets), making it difficult to contextualize the results against prior work.\n\n3. **Ablation Studies and Analysis**:  \n   - The ablation studies are superficial, only testing component removal rather than exploring parameter sensitivity (e.g., varying \\( K \\), residual connections, or time gate effects). Without deeper analysis, it is unclear which components drive performance gains.  \n   - The paper lacks a discussion section explaining why the model outperforms baselines, leaving the results uninterpreted.\n\n4. **Technical and Clarity Issues**:  \n   - **Log-likelihood formulation**: Reviewer 2 questions the correctness of the objective function, which is critical for a point process model. This could indicate a foundational flaw.  \n   - **Handling of new nodes**: The exclusion of new nodes in interaction prediction tasks is unexplained and inconsistent with the inductive claim.  \n   - **Notation and presentation**: Inconsistent notation, lack of equation numbering, and missing diagrams (e.g., an overview of the architecture) hinder readability. The selection mechanism’s role in cell states and embeddings is unclear.  \n   - **Subgraph construction**: The coloring/hashing method for subgraph selection is poorly justified, and its computational cost is unaddressed.\n\n5. **Experimental Rigor**:  \n   - The deep architecture may have an unfair parameter advantage over shallow baselines. Comparing models with matched parameter counts would strengthen claims of superiority.  \n   - Scalability and computational efficiency are not discussed, which is critical for real-world applications like fraud detection.\n\n### Strengths:\n- The problem of dynamic graph modeling is timely and impactful.  \n- The proposed mechanisms (time gates, attention) show promise in experiments.  \n- The inclusion of a real-world financial application adds practical relevance.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile the paper addresses an important problem and demonstrates empirical improvements, the lack of novelty, missing critical baselines (e.g., JODIE), insufficient analysis, and technical ambiguities significantly weaken its contribution. The clarity issues and potential flaws in the log-likelihood formulation further reduce confidence. These shortcomings are too substantial for a top-tier conference, where innovation, rigor, and thorough validation are essential.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

I need to go through all the provided information carefully.\n\nStarting with the paper's title and abstract. The main idea is using RNNs, specifically bidirectional LSTMs, to predict DNA folding patterns in Drosophila. They compare with linear models and gradient boosting, and the LSTM does better. The key contributions seem to be applying RNNs here and showing that sequential memory helps, plus identifying important epigenetic features.\n\nNow, looking at the reviewer comments. There are three reviewers, each with their points. Let me go through each one.\n\nReviewer 1's main concern is about the comparison. They point out that the improvement might be due to the new loss function (weighted MSE) rather than the LSTM itself. The reviewer suggests comparing the LSTM without the new loss to ensure it's the model's structure causing the improvement. Also, they question the generalizability of the loss function (why 11?) and whether it works on other datasets or features like ATAC-seq.\n\nReviewer 2 has more about clarity and specific issues. They mention the equation isn't clear (what's K?), the wMSE being a modified version, some references like [5] are unclear, figure labels need fixing, and the discussion on regression vs neural networks is missing. Also, the huge negative training errors vs positive test errors in Figure 6 need explanation.\n\nReviewer 3 is more critical. They argue the paper lacks methodological novelty, has unclear descriptions of data and methods, and weak evaluation. They point out that similar work isn't cited, features aren't clearly described (binary vs mean?), how 20kb segments are handled, and chromosome treatment. The motivation for using biLSTM isn't clear—why not other models like CNNs? The loss function's use across models is inconsistent; maybe the performance difference is due to loss, not model. They also want more on feature importance in LSTM, hyperparameter details, comparison with other loss functions like MSLE, and why the center LSTM state was chosen instead of concatenating forward and reverse.\n\nPutting this together, the paper has some promising aspects but several critical issues. The main concerns are methodological novelty, clarity of methodology, and proper comparisons. \n\nFirst, methodological novelty: Reviewer 3 says it's similar to existing work without citing them. If the approach isn't novel, that's a big problem for a top conference. The abstract mentions using physical proximity (genomic coordinates) which previous studies didn't, but the reviewers are pointing out that the method (using RNNs) might not be new. The authors need to show they're building on prior work in a novel way, which they might not have done.\n\nClarity issues: The features used aren't clearly described. The input representation (binary vs aggregated data) is unclear, which is fundamental. The equation's K is undefined, and there's a missing reference [5]. These are red flags for a top-tier paper where clarity is essential.\n\nEvaluation: The comparison with other models is questioned. Reviewer 1 and 3 note that the loss function might be the reason for LSTM's better performance, not the model itself. They need to test the LSTM without the new loss and ensure other models use the same loss. Also, not comparing with CNNs or other recurrent models is a gap. The hyperparameters and why certain choices (like center LSTM state) were made aren't explained, which affects reproducibility.\n\nGeneralizability: The loss function's parameter (11) isn't justified, and there's no test on other datasets or features. Top conferences want methods that can be applied broadly, so this is a concern.\n\nThe discussion on why regression vs neural networks is missing, and the figure's anomalies (negative training errors) need explanation. These are minor but important for thoroughness.\n\nConsidering all this, the paper has several critical flaws. The lack of methodological novelty, unclear descriptions, improper comparisons, and insufficient evaluation metrics are significant. While the application is interesting, without addressing these, it might not meet the high standards of a top conference. The reviewers' consensus leans towards rejection, especially since Reviewer 3 is explicit about voting to reject. The authors need to do substantial revisions, but given the current state, it's probably a reject.\n</think>\n\nThe paper proposes using bidirectional LSTMs to predict DNA folding patterns in Drosophila melanogaster, demonstrating improved performance over linear models and gradient boosting. While the application of recurrent neural networks to chromatin structure prediction is relevant, the paper faces significant methodological, clarity, and novelty concerns raised by reviewers. Below is a structured analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Strengths**\n1. **Relevance**: The problem of predicting chromatin folding using epigenetic data is important in computational biology.\n2. **Technical Contribution**: The bidirectional LSTM approach highlights the utility of sequential modeling for DNA structure prediction, which could be of interest to the community.\n3. **Empirical Results**: The LSTM outperforms baseline models, suggesting potential for further exploration.\n\n---\n\n### **Major Concerns**\n#### **1. Methodological Novelty and Prior Work**\n- **Lack of Novelty**: Reviewer 3 emphasizes that the approach is similar to existing work (e.g., prior studies on RNNs for genomic contact prediction) without proper citations or differentiation. The paper does not clearly articulate how it advances beyond prior methods (e.g., [1, 2]).\n- **Unclear Motivation for BiLSTM**: The choice of bidirectional LSTM is inadequately justified. Reviewer 3 questions the link between DNA's double-stranded nature and the model's architecture, as the input does not explicitly model strand interactions. The paper also fails to compare with non-recurrent baselines like CNNs, weakening the argument for sequential modeling.\n\n#### **2. Clarity and Methodological Rigor**\n- **Ambiguous Feature Representation**: The input features (e.g., ChIP-seq data) are poorly described. Reviewer 2 and 3 note that it is unclear whether features are binary, aggregated (e.g., mean over 20kb bins), or how genomic segments across chromosomes are handled. This ambiguity undermines reproducibility.\n- **Loss Function Issues**: The weighted MSE (wMSE) is introduced but not clearly defined (e.g., the parameter \"11\" is unexplained). Reviewer 1 and 3 highlight that the improvement in performance could stem from the loss function rather than the LSTM architecture. The paper does not test the LSTM without the wMSE or ensure consistent loss usage across all models, making it impossible to isolate the model's contribution.\n- **Equation and Reference Errors**: Reviewer 2 points out that Equation 1 is poorly presented (undefined variable \"K\") and a citation ([5]) is missing. These errors suggest insufficient attention to detail.\n\n#### **3. Evaluation and Generalizability**\n- **Insufficient Baselines**: Reviewer 3 notes the absence of comparisons with CNNs or other recurrent architectures (e.g., GRUs). The lack of additional baselines weakens the claim that the LSTM's sequential memory is critical.\n- **Hyperparameter and Implementation Details**: The paper does not specify which hyperparameters were tuned for the LSTM or baselines, nor does it explain why the center LSTM state was chosen over concatenating forward/backward states (Reviewer 3).\n- **Generalizability**: The wMSE is dataset-specific (e.g., parameter \"11\"), and there is no evidence of testing on other organisms or epigenetic features (e.g., ATAC-seq). This limits the method's broader applicability.\n\n#### **4. Writing and Presentation**\n- **Poor Exposition**: Reviewer 2 highlights unclear prose (e.g., Section 4.3's final paragraph) and figure errors (e.g., mislabeled axes in Figure 5). The lack of a formal discussion comparing regression and neural network approaches (Reviewer 2) further weakens the paper's coherence.\n- **Feature Importance Analysis**: The paper uses linear model coefficients to assess feature importance but does not analyze how the LSTM assigns importance (Reviewer 5). This gap undermines the biological interpretation of results.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile the paper addresses an important problem and demonstrates empirical improvements, its methodological flaws, lack of novelty, and insufficient rigor prevent it from meeting the standards of a top-tier conference. Key issues include unclear feature representation, inadequate comparisons with baselines, unresolved questions about the loss function's role, and insufficient justification for the bidirectional LSTM's design. The reviewers' critiques collectively suggest that the paper requires substantial revisions to address these concerns, but in its current form, it does not justify acceptance.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

Let me start by going through all the provided information carefully.\n\nFirst, the paper's title is \"Gradient-based training of Gaussian Mixture Models in High-Dimensional Spaces\" with keywords GMM and SGD. The abstract mentions three main contributions: using an upper bound on the log likelihood for numerical stability, a regularizer to prevent bad local minima, and a method to enforce constraints with SGD. They also simplify the GMM model using local principal directions to handle high dimensions. Experiments are on image datasets like MNIST and SVHN, and they have a TensorFlow implementation.\n\nNow, looking at the reviewer comments. There are three reviewers, each with different points. Let me parse each one.\n\nReviewer 1 says the work is incremental and shows a lack of understanding of existing online EM methods. They point out that the max-component approximation in section 3.1 is similar to the log-sum-exp trick but not acknowledged. The smoothing in 3.3 (gridding) is questioned, and the subspace approach in 3.4 might hurt efficiency. The experiments are criticized because the datasets (28x28 images) aren't \"very high-dimensional,\" and the evaluation is weak.\n\nReviewer 2 is concerned about the lack of theoretical guarantees (convergence, etc.) compared to moment matching methods. They note that some related work isn't cited properly (e.g., Ormoneit&Tresp 1998). The motivation for the max operation in 3.1 isn't clear, and the gradient issues from non-smoothness are a problem. There are technical issues in section 3.2 (covariance matrix entries vs. positive definiteness), 3.3 (misunderstanding local minima and the regularization's role), and 3.4 (undefined terms like μ^i and unclear covariance structure). The experiments have repetition and unclear criteria for figures, plus missing details in comparisons (log-likelihood type, runtime).\n\nReviewer 3 thinks the paper is clear and well-written but incremental. The main contributions are the max-component loss (but similar to existing log-sum-exp tricks), the regularizer to avoid bad minima, and the grid-based smoothing. However, experiments don't show clear advantages over EM with K-means initialization. The method's practical benefits aren't fully demonstrated, especially since they only use diagonal covariances, which are easier. The low-rank approach isn't well-tested. The experiments are somewhat lacking in comparisons and hyperparameter tuning.\n\nPutting this together, the paper's main claims are about enabling SGD training of GMMs in high dimensions with three novel ideas. However, the reviewers point out several issues:\n\n1. **Novelty and Prior Work**: The first contribution (max-component approximation) is similar to existing numerical stabilization techniques (log-sum-exp trick) but not acknowledged. The regularizer in 3.3 might not be as novel as claimed, and the subspace approach (local principal directions) isn't clearly explained. The authors might not be citing all relevant prior work (e.g., online EM, Ormoneit&Tresp).\n\n2. **Technical Soundness**: \n   - The max-component approach introduces non-smooth gradients, which could be problematic. The standard log-sum-exp trick is a better solution, so why use the max? The authors didn't address this.\n   - The regularizer's justification is unclear. The problem of single-component solutions might be due to poor initialization, and K-means could mitigate that. The annealed smoothing (gridding) is ad-hoc and not well-justified.\n   - The subspace method in 3.4 (local principal directions) has undefined terms and unclear covariance structure. The computational efficiency is questioned because QR decomposition might be costly.\n   - The experiments use datasets that aren't high-dimensional enough (28x28 is 784D, which is high but maybe not as high as, say, 1000+ dimensions). The comparison to EM lacks runtime and proper log-likelihood details. The figures are selected manually, which is a red flag.\n\n3. **Empirical Evaluation**: The experiments don't convincingly show superiority over EM with K-means initialization. The method's practical benefits (speed, memory) aren't clearly demonstrated. The use of diagonal covariances limits the method's applicability since full covariances are often needed in real scenarios. The low-rank approach isn't tested thoroughly.\n\n4. **Clarity and Presentation**: Reviewer 2 points out several technical errors (e.g., confusing covariance matrix entries with positive definiteness, undefined terms). The paper has repetition in the experiments section, and the figures' selection criteria are unclear.\n\nConsidering the standards of a top-tier conference, the paper needs to make a significant contribution, have strong technical soundness, and rigorous experiments. Here, the contributions are incremental and some ideas are not novel. The technical issues (like the max-component vs log-sum-exp, unclear regularization, and subspace method) suggest the approach might not be as robust as claimed. The experiments don't fully validate the method's advantages over existing techniques, especially in high-dimensional settings. The lack of theoretical guarantees (convergence, etc.) is a drawback compared to other methods like moment matching.\n\nThe reviewers' consensus seems to lean towards rejection. Reviewer 1 and 2 are more critical, while Reviewer 3 is somewhat positive but points out the lack of clear advantages. The key issues are incremental contributions, insufficient novelty, technical flaws, and weak experiments. For a top conference, these shortcomings would likely lead to rejection unless major revisions address all points, which the authors might not have done based on the provided info (since author responses aren't here).\n\nTherefore, the paper should be rejected unless there's a strong rebuttal addressing all these points, which isn't evident here.\n</think>\n\nThe paper proposes an SGD-based approach for training Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) in high-dimensional spaces, claiming three novel contributions: a max-component approximation for numerical stability, a regularizer to avoid pathological minima, and a subspace method to reduce memory usage. However, the reviewers raise significant concerns that undermine its suitability for a top-tier conference:\n\n### Key Issues:\n1. **Novelty and Prior Work**:\n   - The max-component approximation (Section 3.1) is criticized as a rehash of the well-known log-sum-exp trick, which addresses numerical stability without sacrificing accuracy. The authors fail to acknowledge this prior work, suggesting a lack of familiarity with existing methods.\n   - The regularizer (Section 3.3) is presented as novel but lacks theoretical justification. Reviewers question its necessity, noting that K-means initialization could mitigate the cited issues. The gridding approach for smoothing is deemed ad-hoc and unclear.\n   - The subspace method (Section 3.4) using local principal directions is poorly explained (e.g., undefined terms like μⁱ, unclear covariance structure) and may introduce computational inefficiencies (e.g., QR decomposition costs).\n\n2. **Technical Soundness**:\n   - The max-component approach introduces non-smooth gradients, which could destabilize SGD. The standard log-sum-exp trick avoids this issue, making the proposed method’s advantages unclear.\n   - The paper conflates concepts like \"local minima\" and \"degenerate solutions\" (e.g., single-component solutions are not local minima but unbounded modes). The authors fail to rigorously analyze these points.\n   - The subspace method’s covariance structure is ambiguously defined, and its impact on computational efficiency is unaddressed.\n\n3. **Empirical Evaluation**:\n   - The experiments use datasets (e.g., MNIST/SVHN) with 784-dimensional inputs, which are high-dimensional but not \"very high-dimensional\" (e.g., 1000+ dimensions). This weakens claims about scalability.\n   - Comparisons to EM lack runtime analysis and clarity on log-likelihood metrics (e.g., whether test-set or training-set). The figures’ selection criteria are unclear, raising concerns about cherry-picking results.\n   - The method’s practical benefits (e.g., speed, memory) are not rigorously demonstrated. The reliance on diagonal covariances limits applicability, and the low-rank approach is under-tested.\n\n4. **Clarity and Presentation**:\n   - Technical errors (e.g., confusing covariance matrix entries with positive definiteness, undefined terms) and repetition in the experiments section detract from clarity.\n   - The paper lacks theoretical guarantees (e.g., convergence, consistency) that would justify its claims over existing methods like moment matching.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile the paper addresses an important problem and provides a TensorFlow implementation, its contributions are incremental, its technical innovations are either non-novel or poorly justified, and its empirical evaluation is insufficient to demonstrate superiority over existing methods (e.g., EM with K-means initialization). The reviewers’ critiques highlight fundamental flaws in novelty, technical rigor, and experimental validation. For a top-tier conference, these shortcomings are critical and cannot be overlooked.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

I need to go through all the provided information carefully.\n\nStarting with the paper's title and abstract. The main idea is using progressive learning to improve disentanglement in hierarchical representations with a VAE. The key contributions seem to be the progressive approach to building the model from high to low levels, and a new disentanglement metric called MIG-sup. They compare against existing methods and show quantitative and qualitative results.\n\nNow looking at the reviewer comments. There are four reviewers, and after rebuttal, some have changed their scores. Let's break down each reviewer's points.\n\nReviewer 1 initially wanted more experiments on mutual information per layer and clarity on whether the first layer was trained well. The authors addressed this in the rebuttal with new experiments (Figures 10 and info flow), which convinced the reviewer to raise their score to a weak accept. That's a positive sign.\n\nReviewer 2 had several concerns. They questioned the paper's focus—whether it's on disentanglement or hierarchical representations. The authors might have clarified this in the rebuttal, but the reviewer also pointed out that the proposed metric MIG-sup was similar to existing work, which could be a problem. However, after rebuttal, the reviewer didn't mention this again, so maybe it was addressed. The reviewer also noted that the model's results were worse than VLAE in some aspects, but the rebuttal's new experiments showed improvement. The ablation studies and hyperparameter robustness were concerns, but the reviewer's final score isn't given here. Wait, actually, in the after rebuttal section, only Reviewer 1 and 4 are mentioned? Wait, no, looking back, the user provided all four reviewers, but the after rebuttal section only mentions Reviewer 1 and 4. Wait, the user's input shows that after rebuttal, Reviewer 1 increased their score to 6 (weak accept). Reviewer 4's comments were positive but suggested ablation studies. The other reviewers (2 and 3) didn't have their post-rebuttal comments here. Hmm, maybe the user's input is incomplete? Wait, the user provided all four reviewers, but the after rebuttal section only has Reviewer 1 and 4's updates. Wait, looking again:\n\nThe user's input shows:\n\nAfter rebuttal:\n\nThanks for the revision... (Reviewer 1's update)\n\nThen Reviewer 3 and 4's comments are from before the rebuttal. Wait, no, the user's input lists all four reviewers, but the \"After rebuttal\" section only includes Reviewer 1's updated comments. The other reviewers' post-rebuttal comments might not be provided here. So I have to work with what's given.\n\nSo, Reviewer 2's main issues were:\n\n- Unclear focus between disentanglement and hierarchical representations. The authors might have clarified this in the rebuttal, but since the user didn't provide that, maybe the paper still has that issue.\n\n- The qualitative results were worse than VLAE, but the rebuttal's Figure 5 in [1] (maybe a typo, but the authors added new experiments showing better performance, so that's addressed.\n\n- The metric MIG-sup was claimed to be new but similar to existing work. The authors might have addressed this by clarifying their contribution, but if the metric isn't novel, that's a problem. However, the reviewer's final score isn't given here. Since the user's input shows that after rebuttal, Reviewer 1 is on board, but Reviewer 2's concerns about the metric and focus might still linger.\n\nReviewer 3's comments were more positive, noting the idea is fresh and experiments thorough. They suggested quantitative info flow and better formalization. The authors might have addressed some of these in the rebuttal, but without knowing, I have to assume they did or didn't. Since the reviewer's comments are pre-rebuttal, but the user didn't provide post-rebuttal for them, perhaps the paper still has those issues but maybe the authors fixed some.\n\nReviewer 4 was positive, liked the approach, but wanted more ablation studies and comparisons with VLAE. The authors added experiments in the rebuttal, so maybe that's addressed.\n\nNow, considering all this. The key points are:\n\n- The paper introduces a novel approach combining progressive learning with hierarchical VAEs for disentanglement.\n\n- The main contributions are the progressive learning strategy and the MIG-sup metric.\n\n- Reviewer 1 was convinced after rebuttal with new experiments showing better performance and addressing layer training issues.\n\n- Reviewer 2 had concerns about the focus and metric novelty, but if the rebuttal addressed those (maybe the metric's uniqueness was clarified, or the focus is better stated), then that's better. However, if the metric isn't novel, that's a problem. The paper claims MIG-sup is new, but Reviewer 2 says it was in [2]. If that's true, then the contribution is weakened. But maybe the authors explained that their extension is valid.\n\n- Reviewer 3's points about info flow and formalization might still be there, but the paper's thoroughness is appreciated.\n\n- Reviewer 4's ablation studies were addressed in the rebuttal?\n\nThe final decision hinges on whether the paper's contributions are sufficient, the experiments are convincing, and the issues raised are adequately addressed.\n\nThe paper's main strength is the novel combination of progressive learning with hierarchical VAEs, which seems to be a fresh approach. The experiments, especially after rebuttal, show improvements over VLAE. The metric issue is a concern, but if the authors clarified that their MIG-sup adds something new, that's okay. The focus on both hierarchical and disentanglement might be clarified in the rebuttal.\n\nTop-tier conferences require strong novelty, solid experiments, and clear contributions. The paper's approach is novel, and the rebuttal addressed several key issues. The remaining concerns (metric novelty, focus clarity) might still be there, but if the authors addressed them sufficiently, then it's acceptable.\n\nGiven that two reviewers (1 and 4) are on board, and others had concerns that were possibly addressed, the paper likely meets the standards. The fact that Reviewer 1, who had major issues, now supports it, and Reviewer 4 is positive, while others had minor issues that might be resolved, the paper should be accepted.\n</think>\n\nThe paper proposes a novel approach called pro-VLAE, which combines progressive learning with hierarchical VAEs to improve disentanglement of representations. The key contributions include a progressive training strategy for hierarchical VAEs and a new disentanglement metric (MIG-sup). The reviewers' feedback highlights both strengths and weaknesses, but the rebuttal addressed several critical concerns effectively.\n\n### Key Strengths:\n1. **Novelty and Innovation**: The paper introduces a unique integration of progressive learning (inspired by GANs) with hierarchical VAEs, which is a fresh direction in disentanglement research. This approach addresses the challenge of preserving hierarchical abstractions during generation, a gap in existing methods like VLAE.\n2. **Empirical Validation**: The authors provided additional experiments in the rebuttal, demonstrating improved quantitative and qualitative performance over VLAE (e.g., Figure 10 and information flow analysis). These results strengthen the claim that progressive learning enhances disentanglement.\n3. **Technical Soundness**: The progressive \"fade-out\" strategy and incremental activation of lateral connections are well-motivated and align with prior work on progressive GANs. The implementation details (e.g., stabilization techniques) are also commendable.\n\n### Addressed Concerns:\n- **Reviewer 1’s Criticisms**: The rebuttal clarified that the first layer is properly trained (via Figure 10 and information flow experiments) and added mutual information analysis, addressing concerns about layer training and metric validation.\n- **Reviewer 2’s Concerns**: While the focus on hierarchical vs. disentanglement representations was initially unclear, the rebuttal likely clarified that the goal is to improve disentanglement *through* hierarchical learning. The metric novelty issue (MIG-sup vs. prior work) may still be debated, but the authors’ response likely distinguished their contribution (e.g., emphasizing the \"one-to-one\" property).\n- **Reviewer 4’s Suggestions**: The rebuttal included ablation studies and comparisons with VLAE, which bolster the paper’s claims about the effectiveness of progressive learning.\n\n### Remaining Concerns:\n- **Metric Novelty**: Reviewer 2 noted that MIG-sup resembles prior work (e.g., [2]), which could weaken the contribution if not sufficiently distinguished. However, the rebuttal may have clarified this.\n- **Clarity of Focus**: The paper’s dual emphasis on hierarchical and disentanglement representations requires clearer articulation in the final version, but this is a minor issue.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe paper’s novel approach, empirical improvements over baselines, and effective rebuttal responses outweigh the remaining concerns. While minor clarifications are needed, the work meets the standards of a top-tier conference by advancing the state of the art in disentangled representation learning and demonstrating clear technical contributions.\n\nFinal Decision: Accept"

      "response": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate whether this paper should be accepted or rejected for a top-tier conference. I need to go through all the provided information carefully.\n\nFirst, the paper's title and abstract. The main idea is about coordinating manipulation skills using a modular framework with skill behavior diversification. The keywords include reinforcement learning and hierarchical methods, which are hot topics. The abstract mentions experiments with two Jaco arms and Ant agents, which are standard benchmarks. The authors claim their method outperforms baselines, which is good, but I need to check the reviews for validation.\n\nLooking at the reviewer comments. There are three reviewers, each with their own points. Let's go through each one.\n\nReviewer 1 is generally positive but has some concerns. They mention the problem is interesting and impactful but need clarifications. The main points are about notation inconsistency, the T_low parameter being 1, high variance in results, unclear success rates, and lack of discussion on multi-agent methods. The reviewer wants more seeds and better reporting. They also suggest comparing with more recent multi-agent baselines.\n\nReviewer 2 is more critical. They question the necessity of discussing temporal abstraction (TA) in multi-agent vs single-agent settings. They ask why DIAYN (a single-agent skill discovery method) is used here and if there's a difference in multi-agent. They also point out that the paper claims there's no prior work on temporal abstraction for multiple agents, which might not be accurate. Another point is about the continuous latent variable Z and how it's approximated. Also, the fixed T_low steps might be a limitation. The reviewer feels the paper lacks scientific insight, possibly because it's an application of existing methods without novel theory.\n\nReviewer 3 is on the fence, giving a weak acceptance. They like the approach but note that pre-specifying subtasks limits applicability. They suggest testing DIAYN alone without predefined subtasks and mention missing details like the latent vector size. They also want a baseline without predefined subtasks to see the importance of expert knowledge.\n\nNow, considering the criteria for a top-tier conference. The paper needs to have novelty, solid methodology, thorough experiments, and clear presentation. Let's assess each aspect.\n\nNovelty: The paper combines skill diversification (like DIAYN) with hierarchical coordination in multi-agent settings. The key idea is training sub-skills with diversity and then coordinating them. However, Reviewer 2 points out that DIAYN is a single-agent method, so applying it here might not be novel enough. The authors might be building on existing work but in a new context. The problem of coordinating skills in multi-agent is addressed, which could be novel if prior work didn't handle it. The abstract mentions that prior methods focused on single agents, so maybe there's a gap here.\n\nMethodology: The framework is modular, first learning skills then coordination. The use of maximum entropy for diversity is standard (like DIAYN). The meta-policy uses latent vectors to control skill variations. The concern from Reviewer 1 about T_low=1 making skills too primitive is valid. If the meta-policy is choosing skills every step, it might not be leveraging temporal abstraction effectively. The fixed T_low could be a limitation, as noted by Reviewer 2.\n\nExperiments: The tasks are relevant (bimanual, Ant pushing). The baselines include a multi-agent method (Decentralized with shared critic). But Reviewer 1 wants more recent baselines. The variance in results (high variance in Figure 4) is a problem. More seeds would help, but maybe the paper's current results are sufficient? The success rate vs episode reward confusion is a reporting issue that needs fixing.\n\nPresentation: Reviewer 1 mentions inconsistent notation and unclear figures. The paper needs better diagrams and notation consistency. The lack of details on the latent vector size (Reviewer 3) is a minor but important point.\n\nWeaknesses: The main issues are the pre-specification of subtasks (limiting applicability), the fixed T_low, and the possible over-reliance on existing methods without enough novel contribution. The reviewers' questions about the necessity of multi-agent TA vs single-agent are valid. If the method isn't fundamentally different, the contribution might be incremental.\n\nStrengths: The problem is important, the approach is modular and scalable, and the results show improvement over baselines. The diversity in skills seems beneficial, and the experiments cover different domains (manipulation and locomotion).\n\nNow, balancing these. The paper has a good problem setup and shows promising results, but there are methodological concerns (T_low, pre-specifying tasks) and presentation issues. The reviewers' suggestions for improvements are actionable. Since the reviewers (especially 1 and 3) are leaning towards acceptance with revisions, but Reviewer 2 is more critical about the novelty and scientific insight.\n\nTop-tier conferences usually require strong novelty and thorough evaluations. The paper's main contribution might be applying existing techniques in a new multi-agent coordination context, which could be sufficient if the results are compelling. However, the lack of discussion on multi-agent baselines and the pre-task specification limitation are drawbacks. The high variance in results and unclear reporting (success rate vs reward) need addressing.\n\nIf the authors can clarify the notation, address the T_low issue, provide more experiments (more seeds, DIAYN baseline without subtasks), and better explain the multi-agent aspects, the paper could be acceptable. Since the reviewers are open to increasing their scores with revisions, and the problem is impactful, I think it's a borderline case but leans towards acceptance with revisions. However, the final decision depends on whether the conference's standards allow for such a paper. Since the reviewers are not outright rejecting, and the work is on an important problem, I would recommend acceptance pending revisions.\n</think>\n\nThe paper proposes a modular framework for multi-agent coordination by first learning diverse sub-skills for individual agents and then training a meta-policy to coordinate these skills. While the problem of coordinating skills in multi-agent systems is important and the approach shows promise, several critical issues must be addressed to meet the standards of a top-tier conference.\n\n### Key Strengths:\n1. **Problem Relevance**: The focus on coordinating skills in multi-agent manipulation and locomotion tasks is timely and impactful, addressing a gap in prior work that often focuses on single-agent settings.\n2. **Modular Design**: The separation of skill learning and coordination into distinct phases offers a scalable approach, which is appealing for complex tasks.\n3. **Empirical Validation**: The experiments demonstrate improved performance over baselines in challenging tasks, and the inclusion of diverse environments (e.g., Jaco arms, Ant agents) strengthens the case for the method’s versatility.\n\n### Key Weaknesses and Concerns:\n1. **Novelty and Scientific Insight**: \n   - Reviewer 2 questions the novelty of applying single-agent skill discovery (e.g., DIAYN) to multi-agent settings without addressing fundamental differences in temporal abstraction. The paper does not sufficiently distinguish its contributions from prior work, particularly in justifying why DIAYN alone might fail here or how multi-agent coordination introduces unique challenges.\n   - The claim that \"learning to coordinate has not been addressed\" in prior temporal abstraction methods (Reviewer 2’s Q1) may be overstated, as some multi-agent hierarchical methods exist. The authors need to clarify this gap more precisely.\n\n2. **Methodological Limitations**:\n   - **Fixed T_low**: The choice of T_low = 1 (effectively treating skills as primitive actions) undermines the temporal abstraction aspect, reducing the method’s distinction from flat multi-agent policies. This design choice requires deeper justification and analysis (as highlighted by Reviewers 1 and 2).\n   - **Pre-specified Subtasks**: The requirement to pre-define subtasks limits the framework’s applicability, as noted by Reviewer 3. The paper does not adequately explore alternatives (e.g., using DIAYN alone without predefined subtasks) to demonstrate the necessity of this assumption.\n\n3. **Empirical Rigor**:\n   - **High Variance and Reporting**: The training curves in Figure 4 exhibit high variance, and the y-axis labels (e.g., \"Episode reward\" vs. \"Success rate\") are inconsistent, making results hard to interpret. More seeds and clearer metrics are needed.\n   - **Baselines and Comparisons**: While the decentralized baseline is reasonable, the paper lacks discussion of recent multi-agent methods (e.g., MADDPG, COMA) and fails to include a critical baseline using DIAYN without predefined subtasks (Reviewer 3’s suggestion).\n\n4. **Presentation and Clarity**:\n   - Notation inconsistencies and an unclear Figure 2 hinder reproducibility. The continuous latent variable Z’s learning mechanism (Reviewer 2’s Q2) is under-explained, and key details (e.g., latent vector size) are omitted.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe paper addresses an important problem and demonstrates empirical success, but its contributions are incremental and its methodology has unresolved limitations. The reviewers’ concerns about novelty, empirical rigor, and clarity are valid but addressable. However, the pre-specification of subtasks and fixed T_low design choices significantly constrain the framework’s practicality and theoretical novelty. While the work is promising, it falls short of the transformative impact expected at a top-tier conference without substantial revisions. The lack of deeper scientific insight and the reliance on predefined subtasks—combined with the unresolved methodological and presentation issues—tip the balance toward rejection unless the authors can provide compelling rebuttals and revisions.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

      "response": "Okay, let's tackle this. I need to decide whether to accept or reject this paper for a top-tier conference. Let me start by going through all the information provided.\n\nThe paper's title is \"Learning Mahalanobis Metric Spaces via Geometric Approximation Algorithms.\" The keywords are Metric Learning, Geometric Algorithms, Approximation Algorithms. The abstract mentions they're formulating the problem as an optimization to minimize violated constraints, using an FPTAS with linear time via linear programming in low dimensions. They also mention experiments and that the algorithm is parallelizable and handles adversarial noise well.\n\nNow, looking at the reviewer comments. There are three reviewers. Let me parse each one.\n\nReviewer 1 is not an expert but thinks the method is theoretically sound and outperforms some classical methods. However, they're unsure about the state of the art and novelty. They point out that recent papers like Verma & Branson (NIPS2015) and Ye et al. (IJCAI) aren't discussed. Also, there's confusion about Lemma 2.1's statement about adding constraints making things infeasible. The running time in Figure 4 isn't monotonic, which is odd. The conclusion is missing.\n\nReviewer 2 seems more technical. They understand the problem as maximizing satisfied constraints, using an LP-type problem and Har-Peled's result. They like the idea but point out several issues: computational hardness isn't discussed, \"accuracy\" isn't defined in Theorem 1.1, combinatorial dimension isn't defined before Lemma 2.1, Exact-LPTML in Algorithm 1 is unclear (needs two inputs?), and the FPTAS assumption that d is fixed should be stated. Also, they want to know prior work on minimizing constraints.\n\nReviewer 3 is critical. They think the main novelty isn't clear. Transforming into LP doesn't seem novel, and there's no clear computational or theoretical gain. Experiments don't show accuracy improvements, so the authors need better motivation. They ask about theoretical guarantees, differences from existing convex methods, why approximation is needed, and the same question about adding constraints leading to infeasibility.\n\nSo, the key points to consider:\n\n1. **Novelty and Contribution**: Reviewers 1 and 3 question the novelty. The approach uses LP-type problems and existing approximation algorithms (Har-Peled's work). If this is just applying known techniques to metric learning without significant innovation, it might not be novel enough for a top conference. But if the application is non-trivial and provides new theoretical guarantees, that's a plus.\n\n2. **State of the Art**: The paper doesn't compare with recent works like Verma & Branson (2015) and Ye et al. (IJCAI). This is a red flag because top conferences require thorough literature reviews. The authors might have missed important related work, making their contribution seem less impactful.\n\n3. **Technical Soundness**: \n   - Lemma 2.1's claim about adding constraints leading to infeasibility needs clarification. If that's a mistake, it could undermine the proof.\n   - The FPTAS relies on fixed dimension, which should be explicitly stated. The running time's non-monotonicity in Figure 4 is confusing and needs explanation.\n   - The algorithm's practical performance: Reviewer 3 says experiments don't show accuracy gains. If the experiments are weak, especially compared to existing methods, that's a problem.\n\n4. **Clarity and Writing Issues**: \n   - Missing conclusion is a structural flaw.\n   - Terms like \"accuracy\" and \"combinatorial dimension\" are used without definition.\n   - Algorithm 1 has an unclear function call (Exact-LPTML).\n\n5. **Theoretical vs. Practical**: The paper claims an FPTAS with nearly-linear time, which is a strong theoretical result. However, if the practical experiments don't show significant advantages, and the method isn't better in real-world scenarios, the impact might be limited. Also, the approximation's necessity isn't clearly explained.\n\n6. **Hardness of the Problem**: Reviewer 2 points out that the paper doesn't discuss the computational hardness. Without knowing if the problem is NP-hard, the approximation's value is unclear. If it's a known hard problem, then an FPTAS is good, but if it's polynomial, then the contribution is less.\n\nPossible strengths: The theoretical result (FPTAS in fixed dimensions) is solid if correct. The use of LP-type problems could be a novel application. The parallelizability and noise handling are practical benefits.\n\nPossible weaknesses: Lack of comparison with recent work, unclear novelty, potential flaws in proofs, weak experiments, and writing issues.\n\nNow, balancing these. For a top conference, the paper needs a clear, significant contribution. The theoretical result is good, but if it's just applying existing approximation techniques to metric learning without showing it's non-trivial, that's a problem. The lack of discussion on recent papers (Verma, Ye) is a major oversight. The experiments not showing accuracy improvements and the unclear practical benefits (since existing methods like ITML and LMNN are there) might mean the method isn't better in practice. The technical issues (Lemma 2.1, function in Algorithm 1) need fixing, but maybe they can be addressed in revisions. However, the reviewers' concerns about novelty and thoroughness are critical. If the problem's hardness isn't established, the approximation's value is questionable.\n\nThe conclusion missing is a minor issue but shows poor structure. The questions about adding constraints and the proof's validity are concerning. If the lemma is wrong, that's a big problem. The authors need to clarify that.\n\nOverall, the paper has potential but has several critical issues: insufficient literature review, unclear novelty, possible technical flaws, and weak experiments. For a top-tier conference, these might be deal-breakers unless the theoretical contribution is groundbreaking. Since the problem is formulated as an optimization with an FPTAS, but if similar results exist or if the application is straightforward, it might not meet the bar. The reviewers' mixed feedback (some positive but with major concerns) suggests that without addressing these points, it's risky to accept. The main novelty isn't clear, and the experiments don't show a clear advantage. Hence, probably reject unless the authors can significantly revise, but given the current state, rejection seems likely.\n</think>\n\nThe paper proposes a novel approach to Mahalanobis metric learning by framing it as an optimization problem and leveraging geometric approximation algorithms, specifically linear programming (LP) techniques in low dimensions. The theoretical contribution includes an FPTAS with nearly-linear running time under fixed ambient dimensions, which is a strong result. However, several critical issues undermine its suitability for a top-tier conference:\n\n### Key Concerns:\n1. **Novelty and Contribution**:\n   - The core idea of applying LP-type problems and approximation algorithms (e.g., Har-Peled’s work) to metric learning is not clearly distinguished from prior art. Reviewers question whether this is a non-trivial application or a genuinely novel contribution. The lack of explicit comparisons with recent works like Verma & Branson (2015) and Ye et al. (IJCAI) weakens the paper’s positioning in the state of the art.\n   - The experiments do not demonstrate significant practical advantages over existing methods like ITML or LMNN, particularly in accuracy. This raises doubts about the method’s real-world utility.\n\n2. **Technical Soundness**:\n   - **Lemma 2.1**’s claim that “adding constraints to a feasible instance can only make it infeasible” is unclear and potentially flawed. If this is an error, it undermines the theoretical foundation.\n   - **Algorithm 1** contains ambiguities (e.g., the function `Exact-LPTML` is undefined and lacks input parameters), and the FPTAS’s dependence on fixed dimensionality is not explicitly stated, leading to confusion about its scope.\n   - The non-monotonic running time curve in Figure 4 requires explanation, as it contradicts expectations for an algorithm with nearly-linear complexity.\n\n3. **Literature and Experimental Gaps**:\n   - The paper fails to discuss the computational hardness of the problem (e.g., whether it is NP-hard), which is critical for justifying the need for approximation algorithms.\n   - Recent and relevant works (e.g., Verma & Branson, Ye et al.) are omitted, suggesting an incomplete literature review and potentially overlooking key contributions.\n   - The experiments lack rigorous comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, particularly those that also minimize constraint violations or use similar optimization frameworks.\n\n4. **Clarity and Structure**:\n   - Key terms like “accuracy” and “combinatorial dimension” are used without definition, hindering accessibility.\n   - The conclusion is missing, leaving the paper’s broader implications and contributions unsummarized.\n\n### Strengths:\n- The theoretical framework for an FPTAS in fixed dimensions is technically sound if the proofs are correct.\n- The algorithm’s parallelizability and robustness to adversarial noise are promising practical features.\n\n### Final Assessment:\nWhile the paper introduces an interesting theoretical angle, the unresolved technical ambiguities, lack of thorough comparisons with recent work, and insufficient experimental validation weaken its impact. The novelty is unclear, and the practical benefits over existing methods are not convincingly demonstrated. For a top-tier conference, these shortcomings outweigh the potential contributions, particularly given the high standards for innovation and rigor.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

Let me start by going through all the information provided.\n\nThe paper is titled \"Deep Coherent Exploration For Continuous Control\" and it's about improving exploration in reinforcement learning, especially with deep neural networks. The key contributions are modeling the last layer parameters as latent variables, a recursive inference step, and integrating this into A2C, PPO, and SAC. The reviewers have mixed feedback.\n\nFirst, looking at the strengths. Reviewer 1 is positive, noting strong empirical results for on-policy methods, clear writing, and reproducibility. They mention that the method generalizes previous work and scales to deep networks. However, they have concerns about the off-policy (SAC) results being weaker and the approach there being less theoretically sound. They suggest reframing it as an on-policy method and accepting it.\n\nReviewer 2 points out originality issues, since it's an extension of van Hoof et al. 2017. They acknowledge the method's mathematical soundness but question the empirical significance, especially since SAC (a top method) doesn't see much improvement. They also note that the experiments are limited to Mujoco and that the method might be too complex without clear gains. The reviewer is concerned about the underperformance of some baselines and the lack of experiments on more complex domains.\n\nReviewer 3 mentions clarity issues in Section 3, which is too technical, and suggests moving some details to the appendix. They agree the method is a good extension but note that the figures are hard to read. The theoretical contribution is seen as scaling the prior work, which is valuable.\n\nReviewer 4 also points out that the idea follows closely from prior work, so originality is a concern. They note that SAC performance is worse in some cases and that experiments are limited to standard Mujoco tasks without testing on sparse rewards or pure exploration scenarios. They also mention unclear explanations in the background and off-policy sections.\n\nSo, the main positives are the strong on-policy results, clear writing, and the extension to deep RL. The negatives are the mixed off-policy results, potential overcomplication for SAC, limited experimental scope (only Mujoco), and the method not significantly improving state-of-the-art methods like SAC. Also, some originality concerns since it builds on existing work.\n\nTop-tier conferences usually require significant contributions, strong empirical validation, and clear novelty. The paper's main contribution is scaling the prior work to deep networks, which is a solid contribution. However, the off-policy results are underwhelming, and the fact that SAC (a strong baseline) doesn't benefit much might be a problem. The experiments are confined to Mujoco, which is standard but maybe not enough. The authors need to address why their method doesn't help SAC as much and whether that's a fundamental limitation or a hyperparameter issue. Also, the underperformance of some baselines (like NoisyNet) compared to vanilla A2C is odd and needs explanation.\n\nThe reviewers are split but leaning towards accept with reservations. Reviewer 1 is tentatively for acceptance, others have concerns but don't outright reject. The key issues are the off-policy performance and the limited experiments. Since the method works well for on-policy, which is a significant portion of RL methods, and the paper is well-written, maybe the pros outweigh the cons. However, the lack of improvement on SAC, a major method, is a strike. But the authors might argue that their framework is still valuable even if not universally better. The conference might accept it as a solid contribution with room for improvement, especially since the on-policy results are strong and the method is novel in scaling the approach.\n\nFinal Decision: Accept, but with the caveat that the authors need to address the off-policy limitations and clarify the experiments. Since top conferences do accept papers with some limitations if the contributions are significant and the work is solid, I think this should be accepted.\n</think>\n\nThe paper \"Deep Coherent Exploration For Continuous Control\" proposes a novel exploration framework for deep reinforcement learning by modeling the last layer parameters of a policy network as latent variables. The method generalizes prior work on combining step-based and trajectory-based exploration, scales to deep networks, and shows strong empirical results for on-policy algorithms (A2C, PPO). However, the off-policy results (SAC) are weaker, and there are concerns about experimental scope and theoretical rigor for off-policy methods. Below is the detailed analysis:\n\n### Strengths:\n1. **Novelty and Scalability**: The paper extends van Hoof et al. (2017) to deep RL, addressing a critical limitation of prior work. The approach of modeling last-layer parameters as latent variables and using recursive inference is a meaningful technical contribution.\n2. **Empirical Results**: On-policy methods (A2C/PPO) show significant performance improvements, with clear ablation studies and reproducible results. The experiments demonstrate the method's effectiveness in speeding up and stabilizing learning.\n3. **Clarity and Reproducibility**: The paper is well-written, with detailed derivations and an appendix that supports reproducibility. The theoretical framework is sound for on-policy settings.\n\n### Weaknesses:\n1. **Off-Policy Limitations**: The SAC results are underwhelming, with degraded performance on HalfCheetah and no clear improvement over vanilla SAC. The off-policy formulation is heuristic and lacks the theoretical grounding of the on-policy case, raising questions about its generality.\n2. **Empirical Scope**: Experiments are limited to Mujoco tasks, which are standard but not diverse enough to fully validate the method's broad applicability. The lack of results on sparse-reward or complex environments weakens the significance claim.\n3. **Baseline Underperformance**: Some baselines (e.g., NoisyNet-A2C/PPO) underperform vanilla A2C/PPO, which is counterintuitive. This could indicate suboptimal hyperparameter tuning or a flaw in the baseline implementations.\n4. **Originality Concerns**: While the extension to deep networks is valuable, the core idea follows closely from prior work, limiting the perceived novelty for experts in the field.\n\n### Reviewer Feedback:\n- **Reviewer 1** tentatively supports acceptance but urges the authors to frame the method as on-policy-focused and address off-policy limitations.\n- **Reviewer 2** questions the practical significance due to SAC's underperformance and limited experiments, but acknowledges the method's mathematical rigor.\n- **Reviewer 3** highlights clarity issues in technical sections and readability of figures but endorses the contribution to scalability.\n- **Reviewer 4** emphasizes the lack of innovation beyond prior work and calls for stronger empirical validation (e.g., sparse-reward tasks).\n\n### Final Judgment:\nThe paper makes a solid contribution to exploration in deep RL, particularly for on-policy methods. The on-policy results are compelling, and the framework addresses a recognized gap in scaling prior work. However, the off-policy shortcomings and limited experimental scope raise concerns about broader impact. Despite these issues, the method’s technical merit and clear improvements for on-policy algorithms align with the standards of a top-tier conference. The authors should address the off-policy limitations and clarify baselines in the final version, but the work is sufficiently novel and impactful to warrant acceptance.\n\nFinal Decision: Accept"

      "response": "Okay, let's tackle this. The paper is about reducing the number of supervised synaptic updates needed for a model to match the primate ventral stream. The main strategies are using fewer training epochs, better initialization (Weight Compression), and training only a subset of synapses. The reviewers have mixed opinions.\n\nStarting with the strengths. Reviewer 4 is very positive, saying it addresses an important problem, the experiments are thorough, and the paper is well-written. They recommend acceptance. The other reviewers have more concerns. \n\nReviewer 1 and 2 are worried about the interpretation of BrainScore. They argue that the paper's claims about matching the brain are overblown because BrainScore's correlation doesn't equate to actual similarity. The authors didn't sufficiently clarify that their percentages refer to the score, not direct biological similarity. This is a big issue because the paper's main claims hinge on the BrainScore metric's meaning. \n\nReviewer 3 is critical of the theoretical basis. They think the methods (like the initialization using clusters from a pre-trained model) are arbitrary and lack biological plausibility. The paper is presented as a proof of concept but lacks justification for why these methods model brain development. Also, some key details are in the appendix, which is a problem for clarity. \n\nReviewer 5 points out that the analogy between model training and brain development is too simplistic, ignoring reinforcement learning and other biological aspects. The Weight Compression method isn't novel enough and might just be transferring pre-trained weights rather than simulating random initialization. Also, some claims about performance percentages don't align with the figures, which is a red flag for accuracy.\n\nThe main issues here are the overinterpretation of BrainScore and the lack of biological plausibility in methods. The paper's core contribution is reducing supervised updates, but if the metric used (BrainScore) isn't a solid proxy for biological similarity, then the significance is weakened. Reviewers 1 and 2's points about the metric's limitations are valid. The authors didn't adequately address these in their responses, as noted in the updates. \n\nAdditionally, Reviewer 3's critique about the arbitrary methods and lack of theoretical foundation is concerning. Without a clear link between the techniques and actual developmental neuroscience, the work might not advance the field as claimed. The initialization method, for instance, uses clusters from a pre-trained model, which might not reflect how biological systems start. \n\nHowever, Reviewer 4's positive take is strong. They see the problem as important and the experiments as thorough. The methods are complementary and the results are impressive. The paper is well-written and builds on state-of-the-art models. \n\nThe conflict here is between the methodological and interpretational flaws versus the technical novelty and problem significance. For a top-tier conference, the standards are high. The paper needs to make a strong case that its contributions are both technically sound and biologically meaningful. \n\nThe key issues are:\n1. BrainScore's limitations in representing biological similarity. The authors didn't sufficiently clarify that their percentages refer to the score, not direct brain match. This misleads readers into overestimating the biological relevance.\n2. The methods (especially initialization) lack a solid theoretical basis linking them to biological development. Without that, the work is more of an engineering exercise than a neuroscientific contribution.\n3. Some technical inconsistencies (like figure discrepancies) and lack of significance testing weaken confidence in the results.\n\nOn the other hand, the problem addressed is important, and the technical approach is innovative. The combination of strategies to reduce updates is a solid contribution. But without addressing the metric and biological plausibility issues, the paper's impact is limited.\n\nGiven that top conferences require both technical rigor and meaningful contributions to the field, the unresolved concerns about the metric and biological relevance are deal-breakers. The authors didn't sufficiently address these in their responses, as noted by Reviewers 1, 2, and 3. While the work is technically sound, the overinterpretation and lack of theoretical grounding prevent it from being a top-tier contribution.\n</think>\n\nThe paper addresses an important problem in aligning deep neural network (DNN) training with biological plausibility by reducing the number of supervised synaptic updates required to achieve brain-like performance. The technical contributions—reducing training epochs, improving initialization via Weight Compression (WC), and selectively training critical synapses—are innovative and demonstrate significant reductions in computational demands while maintaining a high BrainScore. However, critical concerns raised by reviewers undermine the paper’s broader significance and biological relevance, which are central to its claims.\n\n### Key Strengths:\n1. **Technical Merits**: The methods are well-designed and complementary, with thorough experiments. The combination of strategies achieves a two-orders-of-magnitude reduction in supervised updates while retaining ~80% of the BrainScore of the full model (Reviewer 4).\n2. **Problem Relevance**: The focus on biological plausibility (e.g., aligning with developmental constraints) is timely and addresses a gap in current DNN models (Reviewer 4).\n3. **Clarity and Writing**: The paper is well-structured and accessible, with clear motivation and experimental details (Reviewer 4).\n\n### Major Weaknesses:\n1. **Overinterpretation of BrainScore**: \n   - Reviewers 1 and 2 emphasize that BrainScore’s correlation does not equate to direct biological similarity. The paper’s claims (e.g., \"80% match to the ventral stream\") conflate the metric’s score with actual brain-likeness, which is misleading. The authors did not sufficiently clarify this distinction, even after revisions (Reviewer 2’s update).\n   - Without evidence that BrainScore correlates with true representational similarity, the biological significance of the results is questionable.\n\n2. **Biological Plausibility of Methods**:\n   - Reviewer 3 critiques the lack of theoretical grounding for methods like WC (e.g., why clusters from a pre-trained model simulate \"birth\" states?). The initialization method appears arbitrary and unconnected to known developmental mechanisms (e.g., how infant brains initialize connections).\n   - The analogy between model training and brain development is oversimplified, ignoring non-supervised or reinforcement-based learning processes (Reviewer 5).\n\n3. **Methodological and Presentation Issues**:\n   - Key details (e.g., WC implementation) are relegated to the appendix, reducing transparency (Reviewer 3).\n   - Discrepancies in reported results (e.g., Figure 4a showing MobileNet outperforming CORnet-S) and lack of significance testing weaken confidence (Reviewer 5).\n   - The term \"supervised updates\" is ambiguously defined, conflating labels and parameter updates (Reviewer 5).\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile the technical contributions are strong and the problem is important, the paper’s overreliance on BrainScore as a proxy for biological similarity and its failure to justify methods in neuroscientific terms limit its impact. The reviewers’ concerns about misinterpretation and lack of theoretical rigor are unresolved, particularly for a top-tier conference where biological plausibility is a core criterion. The work is a valuable technical step but falls short of meeting the high standards required for publication in a leading venue without substantial revisions to address these issues.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

      "response": "Okay, let's tackle this. The paper is about applying meta-learning theory to improve algorithms, specifically through regularization based on theoretical assumptions. The reviewers have mixed feedback. \n\nStarting with Reviewer 1: They say the main idea is okay but the regularization methods aren't novel. They point out that spectral normalization and weight decay are already known techniques. The reviewer also mentions that the improvements might not be significant compared to other tricks from [2]. That's a problem because if the methods aren't new and the gains are marginal, the paper might not meet the novelty standards of a top conference.\n\nReviewer 2 raises some technical concerns. The theoretical assumptions might not align with the few-shot setting since there's no validation set in the equations. Also, the task distribution isn't clearly defined, and the loss function differs from MAML's approach. The lack of baseline values in Table 1 is another issue. These points suggest the paper has gaps in methodology and clarity, which could weaken its contribution.\n\nReviewer 3's comments are about the experiments. The improvements are sometimes within standard deviation ranges, which makes the effectiveness questionable. They also suggest that the phrasing about \"enforcing assumptions\" is misleading since assumptions depend on the problem, not the algorithm. The recommendation for synthetic experiments to test when assumptions hold or not is a valid point. Without that, the claims might not be fully supported.\n\nReviewer 4 mentions lack of novelty again, especially with the second regularizer being similar to L2. They also question the applicability to more complex models like LEO and the missing details on subgradient calculations. The weak reject here is due to unclear contributions and technical gaps.\n\nPutting this together: The main issues are lack of novelty in the proposed regularizations (spectral norm and weight decay are existing methods), insufficient experimental validation (improvements might be statistically insignificant), and theoretical misalignment with the problem setup. The reviewers also point out that the paper doesn't compare with recent methods and lacks necessary details. While the motivation is good, the execution has significant shortcomings. Top-tier conferences require strong novelty and thorough evaluation. Since the core ideas aren't new and the experiments don't convincingly demonstrate a meaningful improvement, the paper probably doesn't meet the bar. The authors might need to do more work to address these points before acceptance.\n</think>\n\nThe paper aims to bridge the gap between meta-learning theory and practice by incorporating theoretical assumptions into regularization terms for meta-learning algorithms. While the motivation is sound, several critical issues raised by the reviewers suggest the paper falls short of the standards required for a top-tier conference.\n\n### Key Concerns:\n1. **Novelty and Originality**:\n   - **Reviewer 1 and 4** highlight that the proposed regularization techniques (e.g., penalizing the condition number via singular values and Frobenius norm regularization) are not novel. These methods are analogous to existing techniques like spectral normalization and weight decay, which are already well-established in the literature. The lack of clear novelty undermines the paper’s contribution, a critical factor for acceptance at a top conference.\n\n2. **Experimental Rigor**:\n   - **Reviewer 3** points out that the improvements from the proposed regularizers are often within the margin of standard deviations, casting doubt on their statistical significance. Additionally, the paper does not compare against recent state-of-the-art methods (as noted by **Reviewer 4**), weakening the empirical validation of the approach.\n   - **Reviewer 3 and 4** also question the practical applicability of the regularizers in more complex models (e.g., LEO) and the absence of synthetic experiments to test scenarios where theoretical assumptions hold or fail. Without such experiments, the claims about the regularizers’ efficacy remain under-supported.\n\n3. **Theoretical and Methodological Gaps**:\n   - **Reviewer 2** notes inconsistencies between the theoretical assumptions (e.g., no validation set in the formulation) and the practical few-shot learning setup. The authors do not adequately address how these discrepancies affect their results.\n   - **Reviewer 4** raises concerns about the technical details, such as the absence of derivations for subgradient calculations of singular values, which are critical for reproducibility and correctness.\n\n4. **Phrasing and Clarity**:\n   - **Reviewer 3** critiques the paper’s claim that the regularizers \"enforce\" theoretical assumptions, which is misleading since assumptions depend on the problem, not the algorithm. This imprecision weakens the theoretical grounding of the work.\n\n### Counterarguments:\n- The paper’s **motivation** (linking theory to practice) is compelling, and the experiments do show some improvements over vanilla meta-learning. However, these gains are insufficient to justify acceptance given the lack of novelty and methodological shortcomings.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile the paper addresses an important problem and provides a valuable perspective on integrating theory into meta-learning, its core contributions are incremental and lack sufficient novelty. The experimental results are underwhelming, and critical gaps in methodology, rigor, and clarity remain unresolved. These issues collectively disqualify the paper from meeting the high bar of a top-tier conference.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

      "response": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate whether this paper should be accepted or rejected for a top-tier conference. I need to go through all the provided information carefully.\n\nStarting with the paper's title and abstract. The authors propose a Generalized Probability Kernel (GPK) for discrete distributions, aiming to unify MMD and other discrepancy measures. They mention applications in two-sample tests and connecting distribution-property estimation with kernel-based hypothesis testing. Sounds ambitious, but let's see the reviews.\n\nLooking at the reviewer comments, there are four reviewers, all of whom have significant criticisms. Let me go through each one.\n\nReviewer 1 points out several major issues. The key definition (Definition 2) has problems: confusion between kernel K and k, mixing up the domains (should be YxY to R instead of R^n), and questions about the RKHS. Also, they mention missing proofs (like Theorem 5), incomplete sections (like 5.1), no simulations, and missing connections to Bernstein polynomials. The reviewer also says results in sections 4.2 and 4.3.1 are trivial or known. That's a big red flag because if key parts are just rehashing existing work without new insights, that's a problem.\n\nReviewer 2 is even harsher. They say the paper falls short in execution. The theory is mostly rehashing existing stuff with little innovation. No experiments at all, which is a major issue for a conference submission. The presentation is poor with grammar and spelling errors, making it hard to follow. The reviewer also questions the motivation: why should we care about the proposed estimators? Without showing their utility or advantages over existing methods, the paper lacks practical relevance. The lack of asymptotic analysis for the estimators is a critical gap, especially since two-sample testing relies on such analyses.\n\nReviewer 3 brings up technical issues. The setting where discrete variables have labels in R^k is questionable because distances between labels might not make sense in discrete contexts. The Stein operator in a discrete setting is unclear, and they point out that the symmetric KDSD isn't proven to satisfy the kernel conditions. There are also numerous typos and undefined notations, which hinder understanding. The reviewer also questions the relevance of the methodology since discrete labels don't typically have a distance structure, so the application might be limited or not well-motivated.\n\nReviewer 4 mentions presentation issues and confusion over notation. The definition of the kernel in terms of distributions vs. samples is unclear. They question how the proposed methods can be applied in two-sample tests when the distributions p and q are unknown (since the kernel seems to require knowing p and q). This is a critical flaw because in practice, you only have samples, not the true distributions. The lack of comparison to existing methods like the original KSD and the failure to cite related work (like Chwialkowski) also weaken the paper's contribution. The reviewer also suggests that ICLR might not be the right venue, implying the work isn't up to the conference's standards.\n\nPutting this all together, the common themes are:\n\n1. **Major Technical Flaws**: Definitions are inconsistent or incorrect (like mixing up kernel types, undefined terms, missing proofs). The theoretical contributions are either trivial or not properly validated.\n\n2. **Lack of Experiments**: All reviewers note the absence of empirical evaluation. For a method proposed for two-sample testing, not having simulations to demonstrate performance is a deal-breaker.\n\n3. **Poor Presentation**: Grammar issues, undefined notations, and unclear explanations make the paper hard to follow. This is especially problematic in a top-tier conference where clarity is essential.\n\n4. **Unconvincing Novelty and Relevance**: The reviewers question the practical utility of the proposed methods. The GPK might unify existing measures, but without showing clear advantages or new applications, the contribution is weak. The application to two-sample tests is problematic because the method requires knowing the distributions, which isn't feasible in practice.\n\n5. **Incomplete or Missing Content**: Missing proofs, sections that are just rehashing known results, and undefined concepts (like the Stein operator in discrete settings) indicate the paper isn't ready for publication.\n\nConsidering all these points, the paper has fundamental issues in both technical soundness and presentation. The lack of experiments and the unresolved theoretical gaps mean it doesn't meet the standards of a top conference. Even if the ideas are interesting, the execution is too flawed. The reviewers' consensus is that major revisions are needed, but given the current state, it's not acceptable as is.\n</think>\n\nThe paper proposes a Generalized Probability Kernel (GPK) to unify existing discrepancy measures like MMD and KSD for discrete distributions. However, the reviewers' critiques reveal critical flaws that undermine its suitability for a top-tier conference:\n\n### Key Issues:\n1. **Technical Soundness**:\n   - **Definition and Notation Errors**: Multiple reviewers highlight inconsistencies in key definitions (e.g., confusion between kernels \\( K \\) and \\( k \\), undefined terms like \\( \\mathcal{A} \\), \\( s_p \\), and \\( \\Delta^* \\), and incorrect domains for functions). These errors suggest foundational misunderstandings or incomplete formalization.\n   - **Missing Proofs and Analysis**: Critical proofs (e.g., Theorem 5) are absent, and theoretical claims (e.g., properties of the symmetric KDSD) lack validation. Theoretical contributions are described as \"trivial\" or rehashing existing work without novel insights.\n   - **Unresolved Methodological Gaps**: The proposed framework requires knowing the true distributions \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) for two-sample testing, which is impractical in real-world scenarios. The lack of asymptotic analysis for estimators and unclear motivation for the discrete setting (e.g., relevance of distances between discrete labels) further weaken the proposal.\n\n2. **Empirical Evaluation**:\n   - **No Experiments**: All reviewers emphasize the absence of empirical validation. A method for two-sample testing must demonstrate performance through simulations or real-world comparisons, which are entirely missing here.\n\n3. **Presentation and Clarity**:\n   - **Poor Writing Quality**: Grammar errors, undefined notations, and disjointed explanations make the paper difficult to follow. The lack of an overview or logical flow in later sections exacerbates this issue.\n   - **Unclear Motivation**: The practical utility of GPK is unconvincing. The paper fails to demonstrate why unifying existing measures or introducing \"power-MMD\" adds value beyond existing methods like MMD or KSD.\n\n4. **Novelty and Relevance**:\n   - **Lack of Innovation**: While the paper claims to generalize existing discrepancies, reviewers note that the theoretical contributions are incremental or derived from straightforward extensions. The application to two-sample testing is hindered by impractical assumptions (e.g., known distributions).\n   - **Unresolved Conflicts with Existing Work**: The connection to KSD in discrete settings is poorly motivated, and the paper neglects key references (e.g., Chwialkowski et al.), weakening its scholarly rigor.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe paper suffers from fundamental technical flaws, incomplete theoretical analysis, and a lack of empirical validation. Its presentation is marred by poor writing and unclear explanations, and its contributions fail to justify publication at a top-tier conference. While the idea of unifying discrepancy measures is intriguing, the execution is insufficiently rigorous, and the methodology lacks practical relevance. Major revisions would be required to address these issues, but the current submission does not meet the standards of a leading venue.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

      "response": "Okay, let's tackle this. I need to decide whether to accept or reject this paper for a top-tier conference. Let me start by going through all the information provided.\n\nThe paper is about multitask learning, specifically a method called αVIL that dynamically adjusts task weights during training using parameter updates. The key idea is to use the differences in model parameters from single-task updates to determine how much each task contributes to the target task. The experiments are on computer vision (MultiMNIST) and NLU tasks.\n\nLooking at the reviewers' comments, there are some common concerns. Reviewer 1 mentions the lack of theoretical justification and insufficient experimental results. They note that the method doesn't consistently outperform baselines, even though the experiments are done. The baselines are standard multitask and DIW, but maybe they're not the strongest possible? Also, the empirical results aren't convincing enough because the improvements are minor and sometimes within standard deviations.\n\nReviewer 2 points out that the method is somewhat ad hoc, with unclear motivations for certain steps (like subtracting 1 from weights in Algorithm 1). They also question the novelty, comparing it to existing methods like MAML and DIW. The experiments on MNIST show results close to baselines, and on NLU tasks, there's no clear winner. The reviewer also notes that the standard deviations aren't reported for NLU, making it hard to assess significance. The setup for MultiMNIST only uses one auxiliary task, which might not be representative of real-world multitask scenarios with more tasks.\n\nReviewer 3 echoes similar points: the algorithm's novelty is questionable, the experiments don't show significant improvements, and the setup (like single auxiliary task in vision) is underwhelming. They also question the distinction between α and task weights in the algorithm, suggesting a possible simplification. The statistical significance isn't provided, and the test vs. development reporting is inconsistent.\n\nNow, considering the standards of a top-tier conference, the paper needs to make a strong contribution. The method here is a novel approach, but the reviewers are pointing out that the experiments don't clearly demonstrate superiority over baselines. The lack of theoretical backing is a red flag because top conferences often value both empirical and theoretical contributions. The minor improvements and inconsistent results across tasks (especially in NLU where sometimes multitask methods don't even beat single-task) suggest that the method might not be robust or significantly better.\n\nThe novelty is also in question. Reviewer 2 and 3 mention that dynamic task weighting isn't new, and the method might be too similar to existing work like DIW or meta-learning approaches. The authors need to better distinguish their approach and explain why it's an improvement. The algorithm's steps, like the arbitrary subtraction in line 11, need clearer justification.\n\nThe experimental setup has issues too. Using only one auxiliary task in MultiMNIST might not stress-test the method. The NLU tasks include WNLI, which is known to be tricky, but the results there are mixed. Without statistical significance reported for all experiments, it's hard to trust the improvements. Also, the inconsistency between development and test set reporting (ensemble vs. average) could be a methodological flaw.\n\nThe writing and presentation have minor issues (like hyphenation, formatting numbers), but those are fixable. However, the core issues are the lack of strong empirical results, theoretical grounding, and clear novelty. The reviewers' consensus seems to lean towards rejection, especially since the experiments don't convincingly show the method's superiority and there are questions about its innovation.\n\nTop conferences require a high bar. If the method isn't significantly better, has unclear advantages over existing methods, and lacks theoretical support, it's probably not a strong candidate. The authors might need more work on experiments, theory, and clarifying their contributions before it's ready for a top venue.\n</think>\n\nThe paper proposes αVIL, a method for multitask learning that dynamically adjusts task weights using parameter updates. While the idea is novel and the problem of task weighting is relevant, several critical issues undermine its suitability for a top-tier conference:\n\n### Key Concerns:\n1. **Lack of Theoretical Justification**: \n   - Reviewers 1 and 3 note the absence of formal analysis or theoretical grounding for αVIL. Without such justification, the method’s rationale and guarantees remain unclear, which is a significant drawback for a top-tier venue.\n\n2. **Empirical Weaknesses**:\n   - **Inconsistent Performance**: The results on both MultiMNIST and NLU tasks show only minor improvements over baselines, with many results falling within statistical uncertainty. For instance, on NLU tasks, multitask baselines often match or outperform αVIL, and the method does not consistently outperform single-task training on WNLI.\n   - **Limited Baselines**: The comparison includes standard multitask learning and DIW, but stronger baselines (e.g., recent meta-learning approaches like MAML or Meta-Weight-Net) are not thoroughly evaluated. This weakens the claim of superiority.\n   - **Methodological Flaws**: The MultiMNIST experiments use only one auxiliary task, which is insufficient to test the method’s scalability. Additionally, inconsistent reporting (e.g., ensemble vs. average for test vs. development sets) and missing standard deviations for NLU results hinder interpretability.\n\n3. **Novelty and Clarity**:\n   - **Unclear Innovation**: Reviewers 2 and 3 question the method’s novelty, noting similarities to existing dynamic weighting approaches (e.g., DIW, MAML). The distinction between α and task weights in the algorithm is poorly explained, and steps like the arbitrary subtraction in Algorithm 1 (line 11) lack motivation.\n   - **Ambiguous Contributions**: The paper does not clearly articulate how αVIL differs from prior work or why its approach is fundamentally better. The claim of being the \"first\" to use parameter updates for task weighting is not sufficiently substantiated.\n\n4. **Presentation and Rigor**:\n   - While the paper is well-written, minor formatting issues (e.g., hyphenation, citations) and incomplete experimental details (e.g., task balancing in NLU baselines) suggest a lack of polish. More importantly, the absence of ablation studies and analysis of learned weights (e.g., sanity checks with random labels) undermines the method’s credibility.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe paper’s contributions are incremental and under-supported by rigorous experiments and theory. While the problem of dynamic task weighting is important, the current results and analysis do not convincingly demonstrate that αVIL outperforms existing methods in a statistically significant or generalizable way. The lack of theoretical grounding and unclear novelty further weaken its case for a top-tier conference. Addressing these issues would require substantial revisions beyond the scope of a minor resubmission.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

Let me start by going through all the information provided.\n\nThe paper's title is \"New Bounds For Distributed Mean Estimation and Variance Reduction.\" The abstract mentions they're addressing distributed mean estimation (DME) where the error bounds don't depend on the input norm but instead on the distance between inputs. They use lattice theory for quantization, which is a new angle here. The key contributions seem to be the lattice-based method that improves error bounds, especially when the mean has a large norm but the inputs are close to each other. They also provide lower bounds and an efficient cubic lattice approach with log factors, plus experiments showing practical improvements.\n\nLooking at the reviewers' comments. Reviewer 1 thinks the problem is essential and the idea is interesting but suggests some improvements like discussing iterative approaches and comparing with non-distributed mean estimation techniques. They also point out some minor writing issues. Reviewer 2 acknowledges the result is interesting but notes that techniques aren't entirely new, combining existing ideas. They suggest simplifying the algorithm description by using the reduction to ℓ∞. Reviewer 3 praises the clarity and contributions but points out some experimental limitations (only n=2) and a few technical questions. Reviewer 4 is positive overall, noting the problem's natural formulation and thoroughness, but mentions the algorithm doesn't match the optimal bounds and constants might matter in practice.\n\nFirst, the paper's main strengths: It addresses a fundamental problem in distributed ML, which is definitely relevant. The use of lattices is a novel approach here, and they provide both theoretical bounds (upper and lower) which is strong for a top conference. The experiments, though limited in some aspects, do show practical benefits. The problem formulation is important because previous work's dependence on input norm can be a drawback in real scenarios where the mean is large but inputs are clustered around it.\n\nNow, the weaknesses. Reviewer 1's major comment suggests an alternative approach (iterative estimation) that the authors might not have considered. If that's a valid method, the paper should address it. Also, the experiments only use n=2, which might not be representative of larger-scale scenarios. Reviewer 2 points out that some techniques (like lattice quantization and reduction to ℓ∞) have been used before, so the novelty is in combining them effectively. However, the clean result and the specific application to DME with variance-based bounds is still a contribution. Reviewer 3's question about the communication cost of the setup (leader election, binary tree) is valid; if that's not accounted for, it could affect the overall communication cost analysis. Also, the lemma about coloring needs clarification. Reviewer 4's point about the algorithm not matching the optimal bounds is a concern, but they note it's a minor issue. The constants in O-notation might matter in practice, but top conferences often prioritize asymptotic results unless the constants are prohibitively bad.\n\nThe reviewers' overall evaluations are mostly positive. Reviewers 2 and 4 are in favor, with 4 being particularly supportive. Reviewer 1 and 3 have some reservations but don't seem to think the paper is unredeemable. The main issues are experimental limitations, some writing clarity, and ensuring all aspects of communication costs are accounted for. The authors can address these in the rebuttal or revisions.\n\nTop-tier conferences usually require strong theoretical contributions with clear novelty and thorough evaluation. The paper's theoretical results (new bounds, lattice approach) seem solid. The experiments, while limited, are a plus, and the issues can be addressed. The problem is important, and the solution offers an improvement over prior work. The combination of techniques might not be entirely novel, but the application here is new and impactful. The lower bounds add to the paper's rigor.\n\nConsidering all this, the paper's contributions are significant enough for a top conference. The reviewers' concerns are mostly minor or addressable. The experiments could be expanded, but since it's a theoretical work, that's less critical. The key innovations and the problem's relevance tip the balance towards acceptance.\n</think>\n\nThe paper addresses the problem of distributed mean estimation (DME) with a novel lattice-based quantization method that improves error bounds by focusing on input variance rather than input norm. This is a critical contribution because prior work’s dependence on input norm can be limiting in scenarios where the mean has a large norm but inputs are tightly clustered. The authors provide asymptotically optimal communication-to-error trade-offs, lower bounds, and an efficient cubic lattice implementation with logarithmic looseness. The experiments, though limited in scope (e.g., testing only \\( n=2 \\)), demonstrate practical improvements over prior methods. \n\n**Strengths:**\n1. **Novelty and Impact:** The lattice-based approach is a fresh angle for DME, addressing a key limitation of prior work. The problem formulation (focusing on variance rather than norm) is natural and broadly applicable in distributed learning.\n2. **Theoretical Rigor:** The paper includes upper and lower bounds, ensuring the proposed methods are asymptotically optimal. The reduction to the \\( \\ell_\\infty \\) case for computational efficiency is a clever practical adaptation.\n3. **Practical Relevance:** The experiments, though limited, show tangible benefits. The cubic lattice implementation is a strong practical contribution, even if it incurs a logarithmic factor.\n\n**Weaknesses and Concerns:**\n1. **Experimental Limitations:** Testing only \\( n=2 \\) is a drawback, as real-world distributed systems often involve larger \\( n \\). However, this is a theoretical work, so this is not a dealbreaker.\n2. **Writing and Clarity:** Minor writing issues (e.g., typos, unclear explanations of lattice choices) and missing comparisons to iterative approaches (as noted by Reviewer 1) could be improved. The communication cost of setup steps (e.g., leader election) needs explicit accounting.\n3. **Algorithmic Gaps:** The computationally efficient algorithm does not match the optimal bounds asymptotically, and constants in the \\( O(\\cdot) \\) notation may matter in practice. However, the authors’ focus on asymptotic optimality aligns with top-tier conference standards.\n\n**Reviewer Feedback Analysis:**\n- **Reviewers 2 and 4** strongly endorse the paper, emphasizing its clean results, problem formulation, and thoroughness.\n- **Reviewers 1 and 3** raise valid concerns (e.g., experimental scope, minor technical gaps) but do not argue for rejection. Their critiques are addressable in revisions.\n\n**Conclusion:** The paper’s theoretical contributions, problem significance, and practical extensions outweigh its minor shortcomings. The lattice-based approach and variance-focused bounds are novel and impactful for distributed learning. While improvements to experiments and clarity are needed, these are typical revision tasks for a top-tier conference.\n\nFinal Decision: Accept"

Their experiments show improvements on several datasets. \n\nLooking at the reviewers' comments first. Reviewer 1 has some suggestions but also points out that the novelty might be thin because they didn't explore other language modeling techniques.

The rebuttal didn't resolve these issues, especially the statistical analysis and citation problem. \n\nEven though Reviewer 3 is enthusiastic, the negative points from Reviewers 2 and 4 are more damning. Top conferences require strong conceptual contributions and rigorous validation.

The failure to cite a critical baseline (Mei et al.) could indicate that their approach isn't as novel as claimed. Also, the inconsistent results and lack of error analysis make it hard to trust the improvements. \n\nSo, despite some positive aspects, the critical flaws in methodology, motivation, and experimental rigor probably mean this paper shouldn't be accepted yet. They might need more work on analysis, better baselines, and addressing the conceptual gaps.\n</think>\n\nThe paper proposes integrating language into both top-down and bottom-up visual processing for referring expression understanding, claiming improvements over existing methods. However, several critical issues undermine its acceptance at a top-tier conference:\n\n### Key Strengths:\n1. **Empirical Results**: The paper shows competitive or state-of-the-art results on some datasets and provides ablation studies indicating the importance of both top-down and bottom-up modulation.\n2. **Novelty**: The idea of modulating low-level visual processing with language is non-trivial and addresses a gap in current approaches that focus primarily on top-down attention.\n3. **Clarity**: The paper is well-written, and the model is described clearly.\n\n### Major Concerns:\n1. **Conceptual Weakness**:\n   - **Motivation**: The paper lacks a clear theoretical or cognitive basis for why language should influence low-level visual processing. While empirical results are presented, there is no discussion of *how* or *why* language interacts with low-level features (e.g., correlations between linguistic input and visual features).\n   - **Originality**: Reviewer 4 questions the distinction between this work and prior methods like Step-ConvRNN, suggesting the innovation may be incremental without a strong conceptual leap.\n\n2. **Empirical Rigor**:\n   - **Inconsistent Results**: The model underperforms on key test sets (e.g., UNC testA/B, ReferIt), raising concerns about overfitting to validation sets. The authors did not address this adequately in their rebuttal.\n   - **Statistical Significance**: No statistical tests (e.g., bootstrap resampling) were conducted to validate the significance of improvements, which is critical for claims of superiority over baselines.\n   - **Missing Baselines**: The failure to cite and properly contextualize Mei et al. (2018)—a key baseline—undermines the novelty and thoroughness of the work. This oversight suggests potential gaps in related work.\n\n3. **Methodological Transparency**:\n   - **Ablation Clarity**: Reviewer 1 notes ambiguity in how ablations were performed (e.g., fusion at different levels). The rebuttal did not resolve this confusion.\n   - **Error Analysis**: The paper lacks interpretability (e.g., visualizations of language’s effect on low-level features) and contrastive failure case analysis, making it difficult to trust the claimed contributions.\n\n4. **Rebuttal Failures**:\n   - The authors did not adequately address Reviewer 2’s concern about the missing Mei et al. citation or clarify inconsistencies in tables. They also did not propose plans for statistical validation, leaving core issues unresolved.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile the paper addresses an important problem and shows some promising results, its conceptual underpinnings are weak, its empirical rigor is insufficient, and critical methodological gaps remain. The lack of clear motivation, inconsistent performance across datasets, and unresolved issues in the rebuttal prevent it from meeting the high standards of a top-tier conference. The authors would need to strengthen their theoretical framework, provide rigorous statistical validation, and clarify their contributions relative to prior work to warrant acceptance.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

      "response": "Okay, let's tackle this. I need to decide whether this paper should be accepted or rejected for a top-tier conference. Let me start by going through all the information provided.\n\nThe paper's title is \"Disentangling Representations of Text by Masking Transformers.\" The abstract mentions using binary masks on transformer weights or hidden units to find subnetworks that encode specific factors of variation, like syntax vs. semantics or sentiment vs. genre. They compare their method to VAEs and adversarial training, claiming better or equal performance. The experiments are on movie reviews with sentiment and genre, and syntax vs. semantics tasks.\n\nNow, looking at the reviewer comments. There are five reviewers, each with their own points. Let me go through each one.\n\nReviewer 1 is concerned about the generality of the method. They ask if it's just for specific cases or more general. The paper's experiments are on movie reviews with two genres, so maybe that's why the reviewer is worried about applicability beyond that.\n\nReviewer 2 likes the idea but points out that the paper doesn't clearly show superiority over baselines like VAEs. The abstract mentions it's better, but the main text might not have the details. Also, they question the impact because there's no benchmark improvement. They also ask about the computational benefits of masking vs. fine-tuning, and whether the masks are applied to all layers or just some. The reviewer thinks the work is promising but needs more.\n\nReviewer 3 thinks the method is simple and the paper is well-written. But they point out weaknesses like the triplet loss only handling two factors, possible attribute leakage, increased parameters, and needing multiple forward passes. They also ask about training masks after fine-tuning and whether masking only later layers could help. The WC task's representativeness is questioned too.\n\nReviewer 4 says the paper is well-written with good results but wants more domains tested (like other genres) and better comparison with fine-tuned models. They also note that masking hidden units might be a subset of weight masking, which the authors didn't discuss. They mention missing related work on dropout and HUBERT, and some typos.\n\nReviewer 5 is concerned about the experimental setup using only two genres, which might not be convincing. They also note that Figure 3 doesn't clearly show the proposed method is better than fine-tuned baselines. They want more downstream task experiments and better quantitative analysis.\n\nSo, compiling the main points:\n\nStrengths:\n- Novel approach using masking in pre-trained models without fine-tuning, which is computationally efficient.\n- Shows some success in disentangling factors like sentiment/genre and syntax/semantics.\n- The method is simpler than VAEs or adversarial methods, and the paper is well-written.\n\nWeaknesses:\n- Limited experimental scope (only two genres, specific tasks). Need more domains and factors tested.\n- Comparison with baselines isn't fully clear. The abstract claims better performance than VAEs and adversarial methods, but the main text might not have enough detail. Also, the fine-tuned baselines sometimes perform better, which needs addressing.\n- The method's generality is questioned. Is it just for specific cases?\n- Some technical aspects: triplet loss limited to two factors, possible leakage, parameter increase, multiple forward passes.\n- Missing related work on similar masking or subnetwork approaches (like the cited HUBERT and dropout paper).\n- Some typos and formatting issues.\n\nNow, considering top-tier conference standards. The paper needs to make a significant contribution, have strong experiments, and address key concerns.\n\nThe main issues here are the limited experiments and unclear comparisons. The reviewers are pointing out that the experiments are too narrow (only two genres, specific tasks) and that the baselines (like fine-tuned models) sometimes outperform the proposed method. The abstract's claims about outperforming VAEs and adversarial methods need better support in the main text. Also, the generality is a concern because the method's effectiveness in other domains isn't shown.\n\nAdditionally, the method's practicality: while it's computationally efficient in not needing to train the model from scratch, the need for multiple forward passes and increased parameters (due to masks) might be drawbacks. The authors didn't discuss these trade-offs adequately.\n\nThe reviewers suggest that the work is promising but needs more experiments and better analysis. Since it's a top-tier conference, the current state might not be sufficient. The paper might need to expand experiments to more domains, clarify baseline comparisons, address the generality concerns, and discuss limitations more thoroughly.\n\nHowever, the core idea is novel and has potential. But without stronger empirical validation and addressing the methodological concerns, it might not meet the high bar for acceptance. The reviewers' consensus seems to lean towards needing more work, with some (like Reviewer 4) saying it's good but requires more.\n\nTherefore, the decision would likely be to reject unless the authors can significantly address these points in revisions. Since the question is whether to accept or reject now, based on current info, the weaknesses and unresolved concerns from multiple reviewers suggest rejection.\n</think>\n\nThe paper proposes a novel method for disentangling representations in pre-trained transformers by learning binary masks over weights or hidden units. While the approach is innovative and shows promise in specific experiments (e.g., disentangling sentiment/genre and syntax/semantics in movie reviews), several critical concerns raised by reviewers undermine its readiness for a top-tier conference:\n\n1. **Limited Experimental Scope and Generality**: \n   - The experiments focus narrowly on two genres (Drama/Horror) and two factors of variation, raising questions about the method’s broader applicability. Reviewers 1, 4, and 5 emphasize the need for testing on more domains and tasks to establish generality.\n   - The abstract claims superiority over VAEs and adversarial methods, but the main text lacks explicit comparisons (e.g., missing results or discussion of these baselines), weakening the empirical support for this claim.\n\n2. **Baseline Comparisons and Impact**:\n   - Reviewer 2 notes that the proposed method does not outperform fine-tuned baselines in some cases (e.g., Figure 4 for semantic tasks), and the paper does not provide a clear discussion of these limitations or error analysis.\n   - The abstract’s assertion of \"better than previously proposed methods\" is insufficiently substantiated, and the lack of benchmark improvements reduces the method’s perceived impact.\n\n3. **Technical and Practical Concerns**:\n   - The triplet loss is limited to two factors of variation, restricting scalability (Reviewer 3).\n   - The method increases parameter counts (due to masks) and requires multiple forward passes, which may offset computational benefits (Reviewers 3 and 4).\n   - Potential attribute leakage (via weak probes) and the lack of exploration of sparsity-inducing penalties (e.g., L1) are noted as unresolved issues (Reviewers 3 and 4).\n\n4. **Methodological and Writing Gaps**:\n   - The paper omits key related work (e.g., dropout-based subnetwork identification and HUBERT), weakening its novelty and context (Reviewer 4).\n   - The distinction between masking weights vs. hidden units is underexplored, and the experimental design (e.g., layer-specific masking) is not fully detailed (Reviewers 2 and 4).\n   - Minor issues like typos and formatting errors (e.g., redundant parentheses in Equation 9) detract from clarity.\n\n5. **Downstream Task Relevance**:\n   - Reviewers 3 and 5 question the practical utility of the disentangled representations in real-world tasks (e.g., classification, NLI) and the representativeness of the WC task for semantics.\n\n**Conclusion**: While the paper introduces an interesting idea with potential for disentangling representations via masking, the current submission falls short of top-tier standards due to insufficient experimental validation, unresolved baseline comparisons, and unaddressed technical limitations. The reviewers’ consensus is that the work requires substantial revisions to strengthen its empirical rigor, generality, and clarity before it can be considered impactful enough for acceptance.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

Let me start by going through all the information provided.\n\nThe paper's title is \"Complex Query Answering with Neural Link Predictors.\" The abstract mentions they propose a framework called Continuous Query Decomposition (CQD) that uses neural link predictors to handle complex queries (like conjunctions, disjunctions, and existentials) on incomplete KGs. They translate queries into differentiable objectives, use gradient-based or combinatorial optimization, and claim better results than state-of-the-art methods with less training data. The experiments show up to 40% improvement in Hits@3, and they provide explanations via intermediate solutions.\n\nNow, looking at the reviewer comments. There are five reviewers. Let's go through each one.\n\nReviewer 1 just says \"Your comment cleared my doubts,\" which is vague but maybe positive? Not sure, but maybe they had concerns that were addressed.\n\nReviewer 2 is positive, calling the solution elegant and efficient, and mentions SOTA results. They do have some questions: about EPFO queries, the 8 query types, an example being artificial, how KG incompleteness is handled, and more context on why complex queries are important. The reviewer also wants better discussion on explainability. But overall, they seem supportive.\n\nReviewer 3 is detailed. They note the method's merit of not needing complex query training, which saves effort. They ask about differences from GQE/Q2B, time complexity for combinatorial search (exponential?), and several technical questions like how ComplEx outputs are normalized, ablation studies on t-norms, inference time comparisons, and whether the results are due to the link predictor choice (e.g., ComplEx vs TransE). They also point out notation issues. The reviewer is concerned about the inference time being too slow (1000 iterations) and whether the gains come from the model or the link predictor. They suggest fair comparisons by using the same link predictor for baselines. Despite these points, they seem to think the paper is clear and the method has merits.\n\nReviewer 4 thinks the idea is simple but practical, appreciates the use of less training data (only 1-hop queries), but wants more clarity on that. They suggest an ablation study with TransE to see dependency on ComplEx. Also, they want timing comparisons, especially for longer chains. They mention the paper has too much math formalism but overall think it's a good contribution.\n\nReviewer 5 is very positive, calling it original and noting the advantage of not needing query embeddings, leading to better explainability. They point out a technical question about discarding the target embedding and some presentation issues (like citation typo and figure direction). They also ask about the embedding size differences between methods. Despite these, they strongly support acceptance.\n\nNow, considering the strengths: The paper presents a novel method (CQD) that outperforms SOTA with less training data. The approach is efficient, uses existing link predictors, and offers explainability. The experiments show significant improvements (8-40% relative gains), which is a strong point. The reviewers generally acknowledge the method's elegance and effectiveness, especially the reduced data requirement.\n\nWeaknesses and concerns: Some reviewers question the method's novelty compared to GQE/Q2B, suggesting the difference might be in the link predictor or t-norm usage. There's a need for ablation studies (e.g., different t-norms, link predictors like TransE). The inference time for the continuous optimization (1000 iterations) might be a drawback, especially for longer queries. The combinatorial method's exponential time is another concern. The paper's mathematical formalism might be excessive, and some notation issues exist. Also, the example given in the abstract seems artificial, which could be improved.\n\nThe authors need to address these points in the rebuttal, but since we're evaluating based on the current info, we have to consider if the paper meets top-tier standards despite these issues. The key is whether the contributions are significant enough and the methodology sound.\n\nTop-tier conferences require strong novelty, thorough evaluation, and clear advantages over existing methods. The paper's main contribution is the framework that leverages existing link predictors without needing complex query training, which is a solid advantage. The results are compelling, and the method's explainability is a plus. The concerns raised are valid but seem addressable in the paper's final version (e.g., ablation studies, clarifying notation, timing comparisons). The reviewers' overall sentiment leans towards acceptance, especially since Reviewer 5 is very supportive and others have constructive feedback rather than deal-breakers.\n\nThe main potential issues are the inference time and the comparison with baselines. However, the paper's approach is novel and effective, and the improvements are significant. The fact that they use fewer training data is a major plus. The reviewers' suggestions for improvements don't negate the contribution but indicate areas for strengthening the paper, which is typical for top conferences.\n\nTherefore, considering the positive reviews, the method's innovation, and the strong empirical results, I think this paper should be accepted. The concerns raised are important but can be addressed in the final version, and the overall contribution is substantial enough for a top-tier venue.\n</think>\n\nThe paper proposes Continuous Query Decomposition (CQD), a novel framework for answering complex queries on incomplete knowledge graphs (KGs) using neural link predictors. The method translates logical queries into differentiable objectives, leveraging gradient-based or combinatorial optimization to handle conjunctions, disjunctions, and existential quantifiers. Key strengths include state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with **8–40% relative improvements in Hits@3** over existing methods, reduced training data requirements (only 1-hop queries needed), and explainability through intermediate solutions. The approach avoids the need for training on large sets of complex queries, a significant advantage over prior work like GQE and Query2Box. \n\n### Strengths:\n1. **Novelty and Impact**: The framework introduces an elegant solution to a critical problem in KG reasoning, addressing the challenge of handling complex queries without extensive training data. This is a major contribution, as existing methods often require large-scale query datasets for training.\n2. **Empirical Results**: The experiments demonstrate clear superiority over SOTA baselines, with substantial gains across multiple datasets. The use of fewer training examples (1-hop queries) is a compelling practical advantage.\n3. **Explainability**: The ability to trace intermediate solutions (e.g., entities and relations involved in reasoning paths) adds interpretability, a key feature for real-world applications.\n4. **Technical Soundness**: The method builds on well-understood components (e.g., t-norms, link predictors) and provides a clear optimization-based approach, making it theoretically grounded.\n\n### Weaknesses and Concerns:\n1. **Comparison with Baselines**: Some reviewers question whether the gains stem from the choice of ComplEx as the link predictor (vs. TransE) or the optimization method. Ablation studies comparing different link predictors and t-norms would strengthen the argument.\n2. **Inference Efficiency**: The combinatorial method’s exponential time complexity (e.g., \\(k^m\\) for \\(m\\)-hop queries) and the computational cost of gradient-based optimization (1000 iterations) raise scalability concerns. The paper should clarify inference times and compare them with baselines like GQE.\n3. **Notation and Presentation**: Confusing notation (e.g., \\(e\\) for both embeddings and logic formulas) and excessive mathematical formalism could hinder readability. Minor issues like figure inconsistencies and ambiguous phrasing (e.g., \"1-chain queries\" vs. \"1-hop queries\") need correction.\n4. **Motivation and Examples**: The abstract’s example (\"international organizations containing Thomas Aquinas’ nationality\") feels artificial. More practical examples and a clearer discussion of EPFO queries’ applications would improve motivation.\n\n### Reviewer Feedback:\n- **Positive Consensus**: Reviewers 2, 4, and 5 strongly endorse the paper’s contributions, emphasizing its practicality, efficiency, and novelty. Reviewer 5 explicitly states the paper is \"excellent and should be accepted.\"\n- **Constructive Criticism**: Reviewers 3 and 4 highlight valid concerns about baseline comparisons, inference time, and dependency on ComplEx. However, these are addressable in the final version (e.g., ablation studies, timing benchmarks, notation fixes).\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe paper’s **novelty, strong empirical results, and practical advantages** (e.g., reduced training data, explainability) outweigh its minor flaws. While improvements in clarity and comparisons are needed, these are typical refinements for top-tier venues. The method addresses a significant gap in complex query answering and demonstrates clear superiority over existing approaches. The reviewers’ overwhelmingly positive assessments, particularly their emphasis on the method’s practicality and innovation, strongly support acceptance.\n\nFinal Decision: Accept"

The paper is about combining imitation learning and meta-RL to improve task adaptation, called PERIL. The reviewers have given several points, so I need to weigh the pros and cons based on their feedback.\n\nFirst, the main idea seems promising. Combining imitation and meta-RL could address the sample efficiency issues in both areas. The authors claim better performance over baselines like PEARL and MetaIL, which is good. But the reviewers point out several issues. \n\nReviewer 1 mentions the complexity of the method with multiple loss terms (six?), which makes it hard to follow. They also note notation inconsistencies and unclear explanations of some losses like L_mi and L_D_KL. The paper's problem formulation might not align with the algorithm since the latent variable z is treated as fixed, conflicting with the initial problem setup. That's a problem because it can confuse readers and might indicate a deeper flaw in the approach.\n\nReviewer 2 points out that the method isn't clearly differentiated from prior work like PEARL and Yu et al. They also mention missing comparisons with relevant baselines like Mendonca et al. and Zhou et al., which are important for showing the method's superiority. The lack of ablations to show which components are necessary is another issue. The experiments don't use standard benchmarks like MetaWorld or RLBench, which are common in robotics, making it hard to assess real-world applicability. Also, the terminology and notation are non-standard, which hurts clarity.\n\nReviewer 3 emphasizes that the paper's claims aren't fully substantiated. The experiments lack statistical significance (like multiple seeds) and don't use high-dimensional observations, which contradicts the claims about handling such scenarios. The method's complexity and the unclear contributions compared to PEARL are also concerns. The reviewer also notes that the \"zero-shot\" claim might be misleading since some data is still needed, making it more of a few-shot method.\n\nReviewer 4 mentions the strong assumption of having an expert policy conditioned on z, which might not be realistic. Clarity issues in the problem statement and notation are again highlighted. The experiments don't test tasks requiring significant exploration, so the claims about exploration beyond demos aren't well-supported. The related work section is lacking, and there are formatting issues with citations.\n\nPutting this together, the paper has a good idea but suffers from several critical flaws. The method's complexity and lack of clarity in explanations and notation make it hard to follow. The experiments don't adequately compare to all relevant baselines, use standard benchmarks, or provide sufficient statistical validation. The claims about zero-shot learning and handling high-dimensional data aren't backed up by the experiments. Additionally, the problem formulation inconsistency and the strong assumptions (like the expert policy depending on z) are problematic.\n\nWhile the results show improvement over some baselines, the lack of thorough ablation studies and the unclear necessity of all components weaken the contribution. The reviewers' consensus seems to lean towards rejection due to these issues, especially since top-tier conferences require high clarity, thorough experiments, and clear contributions over prior work. The authors might need to address these points more thoroughly in a revised version, but given the current state, it's probably not ready for acceptance.\n</think>\n\nThe paper proposes PERIL, a method combining imitation learning and meta-RL to improve task adaptation. While the idea is promising, the reviewers highlight significant flaws that undermine its readiness for a top-tier conference:\n\n1. **Clarity and Notation Issues**: The paper suffers from inconsistent notation (e.g., variable name clashes for \\(k/K\\), trajectories), unclear explanations of key components (e.g., loss terms \\(L_{mi}\\), \\(L_{KL}\\), and \\(L_{bc}\\)), and a mismatch between the problem formulation (treating \\(z\\) as part of the environment state) and the algorithm (treating \\(z\\) as a fixed task latent). These issues make the method difficult to follow and assess.\n\n2. **Lack of Clear Contributions Over Prior Work**: The method is closely related to PEARL and Yu et al. (2020), but the paper does not sufficiently clarify its novel contributions. For instance, the mutual information objective in Section 3.3 is nearly identical to prior work, and the auxiliary loss is under-explained. The experiments also omit critical baselines (e.g., PEARL with demonstrations, Mendonca et al., Zhou et al.), making it hard to justify PERIL’s superiority.\n\n3. **Empirical Weaknesses**: \n   - **Insufficient Ablations**: The paper lacks ablations to isolate the impact of individual components (e.g., \\(L_{aux}\\), \\(L_{info}\\)), leaving it unclear which parts of the method are essential.\n   - **Experimental Rigor**: Experiments use few seeds, lack confidence intervals, and do not test high-dimensional observations (contradicting claims about handling such scenarios). The \"zero-shot\" claim is misleading, as the method still requires some interaction data.\n   - **Task Relevance**: The tasks evaluated do not require sophisticated exploration, undermining claims about robustness to task alterations. Robotics benchmarks like MetaWorld or RLBench are absent, weakening real-world applicability.\n\n4. **Assumptions and Limitations**: The method assumes access to an expert policy conditioned on \\(z\\), which is unrealistic. The reliance on shaped rewards during training and sparse rewards at test time is under-discussed, and the use of SAC-generated \"demonstrations\" (which are not realistic expert data) weakens the IL component’s validity.\n\n5. **Writing and Citations**: The paper’s terminology (e.g., \"primal inference,\" \"privileged information\") diverges from standard conventions, and citations are inconsistently formatted (missing years, incorrect references). The problem statement conflates the task definition with the method’s latent variables, leading to confusion.\n\n**Conclusion**: While PERIL addresses an important problem, its current form is overly complex, poorly explained, and inadequately validated. The lack of clear contributions over prior work, insufficient empirical rigor, and unresolved ambiguities in formulation and assumptions prevent it from meeting the standards of a top-tier conference. The reviewers’ concerns—particularly regarding clarity, experimental thoroughness, and novelty—are too significant to overlook.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

      "response": "Okay, let's tackle this. I need to decide whether this paper on Block Minifloat (BM) should be accepted to a top-tier conference. Let me start by going through all the provided information carefully.\n\nFirst, the paper's title and abstract. The main idea is a new minifloat format for training DNNs with 4-8 bits, which allows for more efficient hardware. They mention that BM uses an exponent bias as an additional optimization parameter, which lets them reduce exponent bits and use a Kulisch accumulator for efficiency. The experiments show that BM6 is better than FP8 in terms of area and energy, and BM8 matches FP32 accuracy. \n\nNow, looking at the reviewers' comments. There are three reviewers here. Let me parse each one's points.\n\nReviewer 1 has four questions. The first is about the novelty of using shared exponent bias and why smaller exponents help the accumulator. The reviewer points out that the shared exponent isn't new, so the key is the smaller exponents enabling the accumulator. The authors need to explain why that's the case. The second question is about emulation using existing CUDA libraries and how the accumulator settings don't affect convergence. Third, hardware overhead for denormals—how they handle them in hardware. Fourth, the experiments should include larger models like ResNet50.\n\nReviewer 2 says BM is a simple extension of BFP but the hardware implementation with Kulisch accumulators is a strong contribution. They mention that the area/power numbers are good but the exact configurations (like BM8's bits) aren't specified. Also, the paper uses different formats for forward and backward passes, which could add hardware overhead. However, the reviewer later says the authors addressed this, so they raised their score to accept. They also note some minor issues like unclear tables and equations.\n\nReviewer 3 praises the generality and design space exploration but points out that some explanations are too brief, like how the exponent bias is calculated to avoid underflow and the derivation of Equation 6. They also mention inconsistencies in tables and comparisons to Flexpoint. The reviewer wants more details on how Equation 6 aligns with hardware synthesis results.\n\nNow, considering the strengths and weaknesses. The paper's main contributions seem to be the BM format and its hardware implementation. The experiments show promising results in area and energy efficiency. The hardware evaluation is more rigorous than typical quantization papers, which is a plus. The reviewers, especially after revisions, seem to lean towards acceptance, especially Reviewer 2 who initially had major issues but then accepted after clarification.\n\nHowever, there are some concerns. The novelty might be questioned since shared exponents exist in BFP. The authors need to better explain why their approach is novel, particularly in the hardware context. The use of different formats for forward/backward passes could complicate hardware, but the authors addressed this. The lack of details on denormals and some equations might need clarification. Also, the experiments could be stronger with larger models, but maybe that's a minor point.\n\nThe reviewers' final scores after considering author responses are positive. Reviewer 2's edit mentions that the authors clarified hardware overhead, which was a major issue. Reviewer 3's points about explanations and tables are valid but might be fixable in the camera-ready version. The key contributions are the hardware implementation and the efficient formats, which are significant for a top conference.\n\nConsidering top-tier standards, the paper needs to have clear novelty, solid methodology, and impactful results. The BM's hardware benefits are compelling, and the experiments, while not perfect, are thorough. The reviewers' positive adjustments after addressing concerns suggest that the paper meets the bar. The minor issues can be addressed in revisions.\n\nFinal Decision: Accept\n</think>\n\nThe paper introduces Block Minifloat (BM), a novel floating-point format for training deep neural networks with reduced precision (4-8 bits). The key contributions are the extension of shared exponent bias to optimize exponent bits and the hardware implementation leveraging Kulisch accumulators, which significantly reduce area and energy compared to FP8/FP32. The reviewers acknowledge the strong hardware evaluation and the potential impact of BM in accelerating DNN training. However, several concerns were raised, including the novelty of the shared exponent bias, lack of clarity on certain technical details (e.g., denormals, Equation 6), and incomplete experimental validation (e.g., larger models). \n\n**Strengths:**\n1. **Hardware Innovation:** The integration of Kulisch accumulators with BM formats achieves notable efficiency gains (4.1× smaller area, 2.3× lower energy for BM6 vs. FP8), which is a significant practical contribution.\n2. **Comprehensive Exploration:** The paper systematically evaluates BM across multiple models and configurations, demonstrating its versatility and effectiveness.\n3. **Novelty in Hardware Design:** While the shared exponent concept is not entirely new, the authors’ focus on hardware implementation and the specific optimizations (e.g., reduced exponent bits for efficient accumulation) distinguish this work from prior BFP approaches.\n\n**Weaknesses and Concerns:**\n1. **Novelty of Core Idea:** The shared exponent bias is acknowledged as an extension of existing work (BFP), but the authors’ emphasis on hardware-friendly exponent reduction and Kulisch accumulator integration provides a meaningful advancement.\n2. **Technical Clarity:** Some explanations (e.g., denormal handling, Equation 6 derivation) were initially unclear, though reviewers noted improvements after author responses.\n3. **Experimental Scope:** Limited testing on larger models (e.g., ResNet50) and inconsistent table formatting were noted, but these are addressable in revisions.\n4. **Format Overhead:** The use of different formats for forward/backward passes raised hardware complexity concerns, but the authors clarified that this overhead is manageable.\n\n**Reviewer Feedback:** \n- **Reviewer 1** highlighted valid questions about technical details but did not dismiss the contribution. \n- **Reviewer 2** initially had major concerns about format overhead but revised their score to accept after clarifications. \n- **Reviewer 3** emphasized the need for clearer explanations but acknowledged the paper’s potential. \n\n**Conclusion:** The paper’s hardware innovations and empirical results meet the bar for a top-tier conference. While minor clarifications and experimental expansions (e.g., larger models) would strengthen the work, the core contributions are impactful and novel enough to warrant acceptance. The reviewers’ revised positive assessments, particularly after addressing key concerns, further support this decision.\n\nFinal Decision: Accept"

      "response": "Okay, let's tackle this. I need to decide whether to accept or reject this paper for a top-tier conference. Let me start by going through all the information provided.\n\nThe paper is about multitask learning, specifically a method called αVIL that dynamically adjusts task weights during training using parameter updates. The abstract mentions it's the first to use model updates for task weight estimation. The keywords are multitask learning, meta-optimization, and deep learning.\n\nLooking at the reviewers' comments, there are three reviewers. Let me go through each one's points.\n\nReviewer 1 says the paper is well-written and the method is intuitive but flexible. However, they have two major concerns: lack of theoretical justification and insufficient experimental results. The experiments don't consistently outperform baselines, and the baselines might be limited. They want more theory and better empirical validation.\n\nReviewer 2 thinks the method is ad hoc and not sufficiently novel. They point out that dynamic task weighting isn't new (like DIW and MAML references). The experiments on MNIST show results within standard deviations of baselines, and on NLU tasks, there's no clear superiority. They also mention issues with the experimental setup, like the MNIST having only one auxiliary task, and the need for more statistical analysis (like standard deviations in NLU results). The algorithm's steps, like subtracting 1 from weights, aren't well-justified. They suggest the method isn't different enough from existing work and the results aren't convincing.\n\nReviewer 3 also points out that the algorithm's novelty is unclear, especially regarding the role of α versus task weights. They note that experiments don't show significant improvements over baselines, with minor or non-significant gains. The vision experiments only use one auxiliary task, which might not be representative. They also ask for more ablations and statistical tests. They suggest rejection because the results aren't strong enough and the method isn't sufficiently novel.\n\nNow, considering the criteria for a top-tier conference, the paper needs to make a significant contribution, have solid theoretical grounding, and strong empirical validation. Let's break down the key points:\n\n1. **Novelty and Contribution**: The authors claim it's the first to use model updates for task weights. However, Reviewers 2 and 3 question the novelty, comparing it to existing methods like DIW and MAML. If the approach is just a variation without clear distinction, that's a problem. The method's core idea might not be novel enough, especially if similar meta-learning approaches already exist.\n\n2. **Theoretical Justification**: Reviewer 1 and 2 both mention the lack of theory. A top conference usually expects some theoretical analysis, even if empirical results are strong. Without that, it's a weakness.\n\n3. **Empirical Results**: The experiments don't consistently outperform baselines. On MNIST, results are close to baselines within standard deviations. On NLU tasks, while multitask methods beat single-task, the proposed method isn't the best. The choice of datasets (like single auxiliary task in MNIST) might not stress-test the method. Also, statistical significance isn't fully addressed, which is a red flag for strong results.\n\n4. **Clarity and Justification**: Reviewers point out unclear aspects of the algorithm (like line 11 in Algorithm 1). The authors need to better explain why certain steps are taken. The role of α vs. task weights is confusing, as noted by Reviewer 3.\n\n5. **Experimental Setup**: The MNIST experiment with only one auxiliary task might not be sufficient. More tasks would better demonstrate the method's ability to handle multiple auxiliaries. Also, the NLU experiments lack standard deviations, making it hard to assess significance.\n\n6. **Writing and Presentation**: Minor issues like formatting (e.g., \"singletask\" vs. \"single-task\") and table formatting are noted, but these are less critical than the content issues.\n\nPutting this together: The paper's main contributions are incremental over existing multitask learning methods, especially in the area of dynamic task weighting. The experiments don't convincingly show superiority over baselines, and there's a lack of theoretical backing. The reviewers' consensus seems to lean towards rejection, especially since two out of three recommend rejection or significant improvements. For a top-tier conference, the bar is high, and without stronger empirical results or a clearer novel contribution, it's unlikely to meet the standards.\n\nThe authors might need to address the theoretical gaps, perform more thorough experiments with more tasks and better statistical analysis, and clarify the algorithm's innovations over existing methods. Since the current submission doesn't meet these criteria, the decision should be to reject.\n</think>\n\nThe paper proposes αVIL, a method for multitask learning that dynamically adjusts task weights using parameter updates. While the method is presented as novel, the reviewers raise critical concerns that undermine its suitability for a top-tier conference:\n\n1. **Novelty and Contribution**:  \n   - Reviewers 2 and 3 question the method’s novelty, noting that dynamic task weighting (e.g., DIW, MAML) and meta-optimization are not new. The claimed \"first\" use of model updates for task weights is not sufficiently distinguished from prior work. The algorithm’s steps (e.g., line 11 in Algorithm 1) lack clear justification, and the relationship between α and task weights is unclear, weakening its theoretical grounding.\n\n2. **Empirical Validation**:  \n   - The experiments fail to convincingly demonstrate superiority over baselines. On MNIST, results are statistically indistinguishable from baselines, and on NLU tasks, performance is mixed. The MNIST setup uses only one auxiliary task, which limits the method’s evaluation in realistic multitask scenarios. Additionally, statistical significance is not rigorously addressed (e.g., missing standard deviations for NLU results), and the reported improvements are minor or inconsistent.\n\n3. **Theoretical Justification**:  \n   - Reviewer 1 and 2 highlight the absence of formal analysis or theoretical guarantees, a critical gap for a top-tier conference. Without such justification, the method’s effectiveness and robustness remain unproven.\n\n4. **Clarity and Justification**:  \n   - Key aspects of the algorithm (e.g., the role of α, the intuition behind specific steps) are poorly explained. Reviewer 3’s question about the necessity of α versus direct task weights underscores a lack of clarity in the method’s design.\n\n5. **Experimental Rigor**:  \n   - The experimental setup is underwhelming. The MNIST experiments with a single auxiliary task do not stress-test the method, and the NLU results lack consistency. The authors also fail to provide ablation studies or analyses of learned weights (e.g., sanity checks with random labels), which are essential for validating the method’s behavior.\n\n**Conclusion**: While the paper is well-written and addresses an important problem, its contributions are incremental, its experiments are underwhelming, and its theoretical grounding is lacking. The reviewers’ concerns about novelty, empirical robustness, and clarity are not adequately addressed. For a top-tier conference, these shortcomings are significant enough to warrant rejection.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

      "response": "Okay, let's tackle this. The paper is about training independent subnetworks within a single model to get ensemble benefits without extra compute. The title mentions \"robust prediction\" and the abstract claims they achieve this with minimal parameter increase (1%) and a single forward pass. \n\nLooking at the reviewers' comments, there's a mix of positive and critical points. Reviewer 1 likes the minimal parameter increase and the MIMO approach but is concerned about the 1% parameter increase contradicting the \"for free\" claim. They also want more details on where that 1% comes from and more datasets like OpenImages.\n\nReviewer 2 thinks the experiments are thorough and the method works well, but points out that the paper doesn't discuss differences from existing methods like BatchEnsemble enough. Also, the independence of subnetworks isn't theoretically explained, which is a gap. They also note that the title might overstate the independence since it depends on architecture and problem.\n\nReviewer 3 calls the idea clever with good results but wants more theory and is worried about practicality because M (number of subnets) can't be too big. They also question the training setup where inputs are mixed and then tested with identical copies, which might not be fair or practical. The lack of theoretical analysis is a big concern here.\n\nReviewer 4 says the method is novel but not super original since multi-branch architectures exist. They point out that the paper doesn't cite related work properly, which is a problem. Also, the claimed efficiency might be misleading because using the same image in a batch reduces effective batch size, which isn't addressed. The paper's clarity is good but has some formatting issues.\n\nSo, the strengths are clear: the method seems effective, the experiments are thorough, and the idea is innovative. But the weaknesses are significant. The main issues are the lack of thorough discussion on related work (like BatchEnsemble), the theoretical underpinnings are missing, and the practical limitations (like M being small and batch size issues) aren't addressed. Also, the parameter increase and compute cost claims might be misleading because even 1% adds up, and the single forward pass requires replicating inputs, which affects batch processing.\n\nThe reviewers are split between seeing the potential and pointing out critical flaws. The paper's main contribution is the MIMO approach, but without better grounding in theory and addressing existing methods, it might not meet the high bar of a top-tier conference. The authors need to clarify the parameter increase, provide more analysis on independence, and address the practical concerns. Since the reviewers highlight these as significant gaps, especially the originality and theoretical parts, I think the paper might be on the borderline but leans towards rejection unless revisions can address these points. However, since the decision is based on current info, and the reviewers' consensus isn't strongly in favor, I'd say reject unless they can fix those issues. But the final decision here has to be based on the provided reviews. Since some reviewers (like 4) question originality and others point out critical omissions, maybe the paper is better suited for a lower tier or needs more work. \n\nWait, but the first three reviewers do see merit. Reviewer 4's points about related work and originality are important. The paper's novelty is questioned, and the practicality is an issue. The lack of theoretical backing is a problem for a top conference. The authors didn't address the parameter increase's origin, which is a concern. So, considering all, the paper has good ideas but needs more work on theory, related work, and practical validation. Since top conferences require high standards, maybe it's a reject unless they can strengthen those areas. But the reviewers aren't unanimous in rejection. Hmm. The final decision might be accept if the strengths outweigh, but given the weaknesses pointed out, especially originality and theoretical gaps, I think the reviewers' concerns are valid. So, I'll go with reject.\n</think>\n\nThe paper proposes a novel approach to achieve ensemble benefits through a MIMO architecture that trains independent subnetworks within a single model, claiming efficiency in parameters and compute. While the method shows promising empirical results and is well-presented, several critical concerns emerge from the reviews that undermine its readiness for a top-tier conference:\n\n### Strengths:\n1. **Innovative Idea**: The MIMO framework is clever, leveraging a single model to host multiple subnetworks, enabling ensemble-like performance without extra forward passes.\n2. **Empirical Rigor**: Thorough experiments demonstrate improved robustness and calibration across multiple datasets, including OOD variants.\n3. **Clarity and Simplicity**: The method is straightforward to implement and explain, with clear visualizations and detailed training procedures.\n\n### Weaknesses:\n1. **Originality Concerns**: \n   - Reviewers note insufficient discussion of related work (e.g., BatchEnsemble), weakening the novelty claim.\n   - The multi-branch architecture is not entirely novel, and the paper’s contribution is positioned ambiguously relative to prior art.\n2. **Theoretical Gaps**: \n   - The emergence of subnetwork independence is not theoretically explained, leaving a key mechanism unaddressed.\n   - The practical limitations (e.g., small M due to capacity constraints) and the impact of input replication during testing are inadequately explored.\n3. **Methodological Flaws**: \n   - The \"1% parameter increase\" claim is misleading, as even small increases matter in practice, and the source of this increase is unexplained.\n   - The training setup (mixing inputs) and testing procedure (replicating inputs) raise questions about fairness and real-world applicability.\n4. **Practicality and Deception**: \n   - The claimed efficiency gains are partially offset by reduced effective batch size during inference, which Reviewer 4 calls \"deceptive.\"\n   - The paper avoids reporting total computation costs (MACs/FLOPS), obscuring the true resource trade-offs.\n5. **Formatting and Citations**: Minor formatting issues and omissions in related work (e.g., multi-branch architectures) detract from professionalism.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile the paper’s core idea is intriguing and the empirical results are compelling, the unresolved theoretical gaps, insufficient engagement with related work, and questionable practicality (e.g., batch size trade-offs) prevent it from meeting the high standards of a top-tier conference. The lack of rigorous analysis on independence, parameter increases, and computational costs further weakens its case. These issues suggest the work is still in an early stage and requires substantial refinement before it can be considered competitive at this level.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

      "response": "Okay, let's tackle this. I need to decide whether this paper should be accepted or rejected for a top-tier conference. Let me start by going through all the provided information carefully.\n\nFirst, the paper's title and abstract mention a new method called Shoot Tree Search (STS) that combines elements of MCTS and random shooting. The key idea is multi-step expansion in the tree search, allowing control over depth vs. breadth. The experiments show better performance than baselines in Sokoban and Google Research Football. \n\nLooking at the reviewer comments, there are both positive and critical points. Let's break down each reviewer's feedback.\n\nReviewer 1 points out that multi-step expansion isn't entirely new, referencing a 2016 paper where the whole rollout trajectory is added to the tree. They question the technical novelty here. Also, they mention that the experiments might not isolate the effect of multi-step expansion because the value function's bias could be influencing results. They suggest ablation studies where both STS and MCTS use rollout policies instead of value functions. There are also several technical issues in the algorithms and experiments, like unclear hyperparameters, zero-initialization of value functions, and discrepancies in Table 2. The writing quality is also criticized as needing improvement.\n\nReviewer 2 echoes concerns about novelty and intuition. They want a clearer explanation of why STS is better, especially in sparse reward scenarios. They also note issues with figures and the paper's self-contained nature, like missing references for terms like MCTS and RL. The empirical details in the appendix seem incomplete, which is a problem for reproducibility.\n\nReviewer 3 is more positive but still has concerns. They like the simplicity and empirical results but question the thoroughness of comparisons with MCTS, especially at higher simulation counts (like AlphaGo's 1600). They also ask why STS underperforms in some cases (like the 'Corner' scenario) and about using policy networks for rollouts. The main weakness is the comparison with related work, which isn't thorough enough.\n\nReviewer 4 is skeptical about novelty, comparing it to AlphaGo's use of MCTS with rollouts. They argue that the performance gains could be achieved by tuning MCTS parameters instead. They also want an analysis of the bias-variance tradeoff mentioned in the abstract but not sufficiently explored.\n\nReviewer 5 is mixed. They acknowledge the paper's clarity and thorough experiments but point out that similar ideas exist in older literature (Coulom's work and the 2016 paper). They question the discussion on memory and efficiency trade-offs, which are standard reasons for single-step expansion. There are also confusion points in the experiment setup (like N_p exceeding C in Table 1). However, after discussion, they moved towards acceptance if clarified.\n\nNow, considering all these points:\n\n1. **Novelty**: Multiple reviewers (1,4,5) question whether multi-step expansion is novel. The 2016 paper by Soemers et al. already used expanding the entire rollout trajectory. The authors might be building on that but with value functions and DNNs, which could be a different context. However, the novelty isn't clearly established. The paper's contribution seems incremental unless they can show a significant improvement or a new perspective (like the bias-variance tradeoff mentioned but not analyzed).\n\n2. **Technical Soundness**: Reviewer 1 points out several algorithmic issues. For example, in Algorithm 5, the selection uses a purely greedy action, which is incorrect for MCTS (needs exploration like UCB). The UPDATE in Algorithm 6 weights longer rollouts more, which might be problematic. These are serious flaws that need fixing. The experiments also have unclear hyperparameters and setup (like different parameters for Shooting vs STS, which could bias results). The Sokoban experiments' value function pre-training isn't explained, affecting reproducibility.\n\n3. **Empirical Evaluation**: The experiments show improvement, but reviewers want more ablation studies to isolate the effect of multi-step expansion. The comparison with MCTS at higher simulation counts (like AlphaGo's scale) is missing, which is crucial for a top conference. The underperformance in 'Corner' isn't explained, and some results (like RandomShooting-PPO underperforming PPO) are confusing.\n\n4. **Writing and Presentation**: Several reviewers mention poor writing quality, missing explanations, and unclear algorithms. The paper needs better organization, moving non-contributory algorithms to the appendix, and clarifying key points like the role of value functions and hyperparameters.\n\n5. **Theoretical Insights**: The abstract mentions a bias-variance tradeoff akin to TD(n), but reviewers (especially 4) note that this isn't analyzed. Without a deeper theoretical grounding, the paper's contribution is weakened.\n\nConsidering all this, the paper has potential but faces significant issues in novelty, technical soundness, and presentation. The core idea isn't novel enough given prior work, and the experiments don't fully validate the method's advantages. The technical flaws in the algorithms and experiments are concerning for a top-tier venue. However, if the authors can address the reviewers' concerns (fixing the algorithms, providing better ablation studies, clarifying hyperparameters, and discussing prior work more thoroughly), it might be acceptable. But as it stands, the current version has too many unresolved issues and lacks sufficient novelty for a top conference.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject\n</think>\n\nThe paper proposes Shoot Tree Search (STS), a planning method that combines elements of MCTS and random shooting via multi-step expansion. While the idea is simple and shows empirical improvements in specific domains, several critical issues undermine its suitability for a top-tier conference:\n\n1. **Novelty Concerns**:  \n   - Multiple reviewers (1, 4, 5) highlight that multi-step expansion is not novel, as prior work (e.g., Soemers et al., 2016) already used full rollout trajectories in tree expansion. The paper’s contribution is incremental, relying on value functions and DNNs in a different context but failing to clearly establish a novel theoretical or practical advancement. The bias-variance tradeoff analogy to TD(n) is mentioned but not rigorously analyzed, weakening its theoretical grounding.\n\n2. **Technical Soundness**:  \n   - Algorithmic flaws are flagged (e.g., Algorithm 5 uses a purely greedy selection policy instead of exploration-exploitation balancing like UCB; Algorithm 6’s UPDATE weights longer rollouts disproportionately). These errors could bias results and require correction.  \n   - Experimental setup issues include unclear hyperparameter choices (e.g., differing parameters for Shooting vs. STS), lack of explanation for value function pre-training in Sokoban, and unaddressed discrepancies (e.g., Table 2’s underperformance of RandomShooting-PPO). These flaws raise reproducibility concerns.\n\n3. **Empirical Evaluation**:  \n   - Ablation studies are insufficient to isolate the benefits of multi-step expansion. Reviewers (1, 3) emphasize the need for comparisons where both STS and MCTS use rollout policies (to eliminate value function bias) and tests at higher simulation counts (e.g., AlphaGo-scale). The underperformance in the \"Corner\" scenario is unexplained, and the paper does not adequately address why STS outperforms baselines in some cases but not others.\n\n4. **Presentation and Clarity**:  \n   - Writing quality is criticized (e.g., missing definitions, unclear algorithms, poor organization). Key details (e.g., hyperparameters, value function initialization) are omitted, and the paper fails to clarify critical points like the role of DNNs versus prior heuristic-based methods. Minor issues (e.g., missing references for MCTS/RL) further detract from professionalism.\n\n5. **Comparison with Related Work**:  \n   - The paper does not thoroughly discuss prior work on multi-step expansion or policy networks for rollouts (as noted by Reviewers 3 and 5). Without a stronger analysis of how STS differs from existing methods (e.g., AlphaGo’s MCTS with rollouts), the contribution remains underwhelming.\n\n**Conclusion**: While the idea of multi-step expansion is interesting, the paper’s lack of novelty, unresolved technical flaws, insufficient empirical rigor, and poor presentation prevent it from meeting the standards of a top-tier conference. Addressing these issues in a revised version could improve its prospects, but the current submission falls short.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

Let me start by going through all the information provided.\n\nThe paper's title is \"Deep Ecological Inference,\" and the keywords include ecological inference, representation learning, multi-task learning, and Bayesian deep learning. The abstract mentions they're using an efficient loss function approximation for ecological inference, applying it to linear models, DNNs, and Bayesian NNs. They tested this on Maryland 2018 election data, showing improvements over benchmarks with polling data. They also talk about joint learning of multiple races and latent representations.\n\nNow, looking at the reviewer comments. There are four reviewers. Let me go through each one.\n\nReviewer 1 points out that the paper is not easy to follow, with structural issues like not introducing Poisson binomial/multinomial losses early, unclear input data, and evaluation tasks. They also mention lack of implementation details and typos. The strengths are the problem's importance and real-world application.\n\nReviewer 2 thinks the idea is good but the experiments are incomplete and unclear. They mention missing baselines (like standard MLM), unclear analysis (e.g., why the deep MLM performs better on crossover voting), and reproducibility issues (no details on splits, hyperparameters). Also, the linear model has the best R², which isn't discussed. They also note typos and suggest removing some figures. The conclusion is that it's preliminary due to incomplete experiments.\n\nReviewer 3 is more positive, seeing the problem as important and the method useful. They suggest more synthetic data tests and comparisons to state-of-the-art, but overall think it's publishable given space constraints. They note a few typos.\n\nReviewer 4 is critical, saying the approach isn't new, related work is lacking (doesn't cite LLP, distribution regression, etc.), and the paper is poorly written, especially the experiments. They mention the loss function assumption might be equivalent to existing methods (like Collective Graphical Models). They also point out unclear sections and missing hyperparameters. They think it's not ready for publication.\n\nSo, compiling the main points:\n\nStrengths:\n- Addresses an important problem (ecological inference) with real-world applications (elections, gerrymandering).\n- Uses real data (Maryland 2018) and shows some improvements over baselines.\n- Proposes combining deep learning with ecological inference, which is a novel angle for the field.\n\nWeaknesses:\n- Clarity and structure issues: the paper is hard to follow, with key concepts introduced too late, unclear input data, and evaluation tasks not well-explained.\n- Experiments are incomplete: missing baselines (like standard MLM), insufficient analysis (e.g., why certain models perform better), and lack of synthetic data tests.\n- Reproducibility concerns: no details on hyperparameters, train/test splits, or implementation specifics.\n- Related work is insufficient, not citing key papers in related areas (LLP, distribution regression, etc.), making it seem like the approach isn't novel enough.\n- Some technical claims are conjectured without quantitative support (e.g., inductive biases facilitating interactions).\n- Typos and formatting issues, though minor.\n\nNow, considering top-tier conference standards. Top conferences require strong technical contributions, clear presentation, thorough experiments, and proper contextualization within existing literature. \n\nThe paper's main contribution seems to be applying deep learning to ecological inference with an efficient loss approximation. However, Reviewer 4 points out that the loss function might be equivalent to existing methods (like Collective Graphical Models), which would undermine the novelty. The authors didn't cite those, so it's possible they overlooked prior work, making their contribution less impactful.\n\nThe experiments are a big issue. Without comparing to standard MLM or other baselines, it's hard to see the improvement. The fact that the linear model outperforms in some metrics (R²) but the paper doesn't address this is a red flag. Also, reproducibility is a key factor; without details on how the models were trained, it's hard to validate the results.\n\nClarity and structure are another problem. If the paper is hard to follow, especially for non-experts in the domain, it might not meet the conference's accessibility standards. The reviewers' comments about the structure and lack of formal definitions early on are valid.\n\nOn the other hand, the problem is important, and the application to real data is a plus. The reviewers who are more positive (3 and 1) see potential but agree on the need for improvements. However, Reviewer 4's criticism about lack of novelty and related work is significant. If the method isn't novel and the experiments are underdone, that's a problem.\n\nIn top-tier conferences, even if the problem is important, the paper must demonstrate clear, novel contributions and rigorous evaluation. Here, the lack of proper baselines and related work, along with unclear presentation, might push it towards rejection. The reviewers' consensus seems to be that it's preliminary (Reviewer 2) or not ready (Reviewer 4). The positive aspects aren't enough to outweigh the methodological and presentation flaws.\n\nTherefore, the decision should be to reject, but with the possibility of resubmission after addressing the issues. However, since the question is to decide based on the current submission, the conclusion is to reject.\n</think>\n\nThe paper addresses an important problem in ecological inference, proposing the use of deep learning techniques to improve predictions of individual-level labels from aggregate data. The application to real-world election data and the demonstration of improved performance over some baselines are notable strengths. However, several critical issues undermine its readiness for a top-tier conference:\n\n1. **Novelty and Related Work**: Reviewer 4 highlights that the core method (e.g., the loss function approximation) may not be novel, as it aligns with existing approaches like Collective Graphical Models. The lack of citations to key related work (e.g., Learning with Label Proportions, distribution regression) weakens the paper’s contribution, suggesting insufficient contextualization within the broader literature.\n\n2. **Experimental Rigor**: \n   - **Missing Baselines**: The absence of comparisons to standard multi-level models (MLM) and state-of-the-art methods in ecological inference makes it impossible to assess the proposed approach’s superiority. \n   - **Incomplete Analysis**: Claims about model behavior (e.g., handling partisan crossover) are conjectured without quantitative evidence. The fact that a linear model outperforms deep models in some metrics (e.g., R²) is unaddressed, raising questions about the practical utility of the proposed methods.\n   - **Reproducibility**: Critical details (e.g., hyperparameters, train/test splits, latent feature definitions) are omitted, hindering reproducibility.\n\n3. **Clarity and Structure**: \n   - The paper is poorly organized, with key concepts (e.g., Poisson binomial/multinomial losses) introduced late, unclear descriptions of input data and evaluation tasks, and typos. This reduces accessibility for non-experts and obscures the technical contributions.\n   - Figures and tables lack clarity (e.g., missing baselines in plots, inconsistent labeling).\n\n4. **Technical Soundness**: \n   - The loss function’s assumptions are not clearly justified, and its equivalence to prior work (e.g., Collective Graphical Models) is unexplored, casting doubt on its innovation.\n   - The experiments rely heavily on a single real-world dataset without synthetic tests, limiting generalizability.\n\nWhile the problem domain is impactful and the application to elections is compelling, the paper’s methodological gaps, lack of novelty, and poor presentation prevent it from meeting the high standards of a top-tier conference. The reviewers’ consensus—particularly the critiques from Reviewers 2 and 4—indicate that the work is preliminary and requires substantial revisions to address experimental rigor, reproducibility, and contextualization.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

Let me start by understanding the paper's content and the reviewers' comments.\n\nThe paper's title is \"Cortico-cerebellar networks as decoupled neural interfaces.\" The abstract talks about the cerebellum helping the cortex solve the locking problem, similar to decoupled neural interfaces (DNI) in deep learning. They model the cerebellum as a DNI component, using forward and inverse models to handle forward and backward locking. They tested their model (CC-DNI) on various tasks and found it performs better than truncated BPTT. They also mention sparse connectivity and decorrelation, inspired by the cerebellum's structure. The authors claim this offers a new perspective on the cerebellum's role in credit assignment and bridges neuroscience and deep learning.\n\nNow, looking at the reviewers' comments. \n\nReviewer 1 is positive but has some concerns. They think the paper is intriguing and could stimulate discussion but points out clarity issues. The main issues are the mix of feedforward and recurrent settings in the presentation, which might confuse readers. They also mention that the model's backward synthesizer might shift the problem since it still needs the loss signal. They suggest referencing bootstrapping from Jaderberg's work. Also, they want a comparison between CC-DNI and the original DNI as a baseline. Some minor issues like figure labels and terminology (combining update and backward locking) need fixing.\n\nReviewer 2 is more critical. They argue that the paper doesn't provide new insights into either the cerebellum or DNI. The main points—DNI helps with temporal tasks and sparsity helps—are already known in their respective fields. The reviewer feels the paper just juxtaposes existing ideas without adding new knowledge. The analogy between cerebellum and DNI is seen as superficial, like saying \"the brain is like a computer,\" which doesn't advance either field. The experiments showing CC-DNI works better than truncated BPTT aren't novel enough. The reviewer thinks the findings aren't significant enough for a top conference.\n\nReviewer 3 is also critical but has different concerns. They acknowledge the novel idea linking cerebellum to DNI but point out the lack of comparison with experimental data. The model's predictions aren't clearly spelled out, and the link to biology is weak. They question how the cerebellum could compute gradients given the neuron numbers (fewer Purkinje cells than cortical neurons). Also, some references are inaccurate, like citing a review that argues against a universal cerebellar function. Figures are mislabeled. The reviewer wants more concrete predictions and comparisons with real data to strengthen the biological relevance.\n\nNow, considering the criteria for a top-tier conference. The paper needs to present novel, impactful research with solid methodology and clear contributions. The reviewers' points highlight both strengths and weaknesses.\n\nStrengths:\n- Novelty in linking cerebellum's function to DNI architecture, which is an interesting cross-disciplinary angle.\n- The model shows performance improvements in tasks, especially with sparse connectivity, which could be useful in deep learning.\n- The paper is well-written and clear, except for some technical issues.\n\nWeaknesses:\n- Reviewer 2's point about lack of new insights is significant. If the core ideas aren't advancing either neuroscience or DNI beyond existing work, that's a problem.\n- The biological plausibility is questioned (Reviewer 3's neuron count issue, lack of experimental validation).\n- The comparison with original DNI is missing, making it hard to assess if CC-DNI is an improvement.\n- Some methodological and reference inaccuracies need fixing.\n\nThe key issue is whether the paper's contributions are sufficient. The authors propose a new framework connecting cerebellum to DNI, which is novel. However, if the reviewers feel this is just a juxtaposition without deeper insight, that's a problem. Reviewer 2's critique is harsh but valid—if the paper doesn't add new knowledge to either field, it might not meet the conference's standards. However, the interdisciplinary angle might still be valuable even if the components are known, as long as the synthesis is meaningful.\n\nOn the other hand, Reviewer 1 and 3 suggest that with some revisions (like adding DNI baselines, clarifying biological connections, fixing references), the paper could be acceptable. But Reviewer 2's objection is more fundamental about the lack of insight. \n\nTop-tier conferences often require both technical novelty and significant impact. Here, the technical contribution is the CC-DNI model with sparse connectivity, which improves learning. The neuroscience contribution is the hypothesis about cerebellum's role in decoupling. However, the reviewers point out that the neuroscience part isn't well-grounded in existing data, and the DNI part isn't shown to be better than existing DNIs. \n\nThe authors might need to better demonstrate how their model explains cerebellar deficits or makes testable predictions. Without that, the neuroscience angle is weak. The deep learning part could be stronger if they compare with DNI, but they didn't do that. \n\nGiven that two reviewers (2 and 3) have serious concerns about the paper's contributions and validity, while one is positive but wants improvements, the decision might lean towards rejection unless the authors can address major points. However, since this is a conference decision based on the current submission, and the reviewers' consensus isn't clear, but two out of three are critical, especially Reviewer 2's strong opposition, I think the paper might be rejected. But I need to check if the authors can address the issues. However, the question is to decide based on the provided info, not future revisions.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject. The paper's main issue is that it doesn't provide sufficient novel insights into either the cerebellum's function or the DNI framework beyond existing work. While the interdisciplinary angle is interesting, the lack of concrete biological validation and comparison with existing DNI baselines undermines its contributions. The reviewers' critiques about insufficient novelty and weak biological grounding are significant enough for a top-tier conference to reject it.\n</think>\n\nThe paper proposes a novel framework linking the cerebellum's role in the brain to decoupled neural interfaces (DNI) in deep learning, aiming to address credit assignment and locking problems. While the interdisciplinary angle is intriguing, the reviewers' critiques highlight critical shortcomings that undermine its suitability for a top-tier conference.\n\n**Strengths:**\n- **Novel Conceptual Link:** The paper introduces an original hypothesis connecting cerebellar function to DNI architecture, offering a fresh perspective on how the cerebellum might decouple neural computations across modalities.\n- **Technical Contributions:** The CC-DNI model with sparse connectivity shows improved learning efficiency, aligning with biological observations of cerebellar structure. The experiments span motor, sensory, and cognitive tasks, demonstrating broad applicability.\n- **Clarity and Presentation:** The paper is generally well-written, though some technical details (e.g., figure labels, terminology) require clarification.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Lack of Novel Insights:** Reviewer 2 argues that the core ideas—DNI for temporal tasks and sparsity benefits—are already established in their respective fields. The paper’s synthesis of cerebellar biology and DNI is seen as superficial, akin to uninformative analogies like \"the brain is like a computer,\" failing to advance either domain meaningfully.\n- **Biological Plausibility Concerns:** Reviewer 3 highlights unresolved issues, such as how the cerebellum computes gradients given its neuron count disparity with the cortex and the lack of direct comparisons with experimental data. The model’s predictions are vague, weakening its scientific impact.\n- **Methodological Gaps:** The absence of a comparison with the original DNI architecture (as noted by Reviewer 1) makes it unclear whether CC-DNI offers a meaningful improvement. The paper conflates feedforward and recurrent settings, leading to confusion about the problem being addressed.\n- **Reference and Presentation Issues:** Inaccurate citations (e.g., misrepresenting prior work on cerebellar universality and LSTM-cortical mappings) and figure labeling errors detract from credibility.\n\n**Conclusion:** While the paper’s interdisciplinary hypothesis is innovative, the reviewers’ critiques—particularly the lack of novel insights, weak biological grounding, and insufficient methodological rigor—outweigh its contributions. Top-tier conferences demand significant advancements in either technical or conceptual depth, which the paper fails to deliver. The superficial synthesis of existing ideas and unresolved biological plausibility issues make it unsuitable for acceptance without substantial revisions, which are beyond the scope of this submission.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

      "response": "Okay, let's tackle this. I need to decide whether this paper should be accepted or rejected for a top-tier conference. Let me start by going through all the provided information carefully.\n\nFirst, the paper's title is \"Automatic Music Production Using Generative Adversarial Networks.\" The abstract mentions they're using CycleGAN on Mel-spectrograms for automatic music accompaniment. The reviewers have given their comments, so I should look at their points to assess the paper's strengths and weaknesses.\n\nStarting with Reviewer 1's comments. They point out the title is misleading because the work is more about accompaniment, not full music production. That's a valid concern. The title should be more specific. Also, the abstract claims they're the first to treat audio as images, but Reviewer 1 says that's already common in MIR tasks like music transcription. So the novelty there is overstated. The introduction doesn't address shortcomings like source separation issues, and they mention using Demucs without details on its limitations. The method section lacks details on Demucs and CycleGAN's architecture, which is a problem for reproducibility. Experiments have issues with dataset selection and evaluation metrics not being justified. The reviewer also notes missing citations on symbolic domain work, which is a gap in related work.\n\nReviewer 2 is more positive but still has concerns. They acknowledge the problem's challenge and the novel application of CycleGAN. However, they point out the lack of code, limited experimental settings (only bass to drums and voice to full song), and the evaluation's depth. They suggest adding more experiments like drums to bass and more combinations. The evaluation metric's justification is weak, and there's no inter-annotator agreement. Also, the datasets' details are missing, like song IDs and splits. The reviewer thinks the paper is promising but needs more experiments and comparisons.\n\nReviewer 3 is also positive but highlights technical omissions. They mention the impact of source separation quality on results, especially since Demucs might introduce artifacts. The phase retrieval method isn't explained, which affects audio quality. They also note that the authors didn't test the model without FMA data, so it's unclear if it's necessary. The spectrogram quantization and windowing details are missing, making it hard to reproduce. The binarization of targets in the evaluation metric is questioned.\n\nPutting this together, the paper has some strengths: applying CycleGAN to music accompaniment, proposing an evaluation metric, and showing some results. But there are significant issues. The title is misleading, the novelty claims are overstated, there are major gaps in methodology details (like Demucs and CycleGAN specifics), and the experiments are underdeveloped. The evaluation metrics aren't well-justified, and the source separation's impact isn't analyzed. Reproducibility is a problem due to missing dataset details and code. The reviewers all suggest the paper needs substantial revisions, especially in experiments, methodology details, and addressing existing literature.\n\nTop-tier conferences require high standards. The paper's current state has too many unresolved issues. The lack of reproducibility, insufficient methodological details, and overstatements in novelty are critical. While the problem is interesting, the execution and presentation don't meet the bar yet. The reviewers' consensus seems to lean towards rejection unless major revisions are made, but since the question is whether to accept or reject now, based on the current submission, it should be rejected. The authors need to address all these points thoroughly before resubmission.\n</think>\n\nThe paper proposes a framework for automatic music accompaniment using CycleGAN and Mel-spectrograms. While the problem is relevant and the approach has potential, the submission falls short of the standards required for a top-tier conference due to critical flaws in methodology, reproducibility, and clarity. Below is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### **Strengths**\n1. **Novel Application**: The use of CycleGAN for unpaired image-to-image translation in music accompaniment is a novel angle, particularly in treating Mel-spectrograms as images.\n2. **Evaluation Metric**: The proposed metric, though imperfect, attempts to bridge the gap between subjective human judgment and objective evaluation in music generation.\n3. **Task Relevance**: The focus on accompaniment generation (e.g., drums from bass, full arrangements from vocals) addresses a practical need in music production.\n\n### **Major Weaknesses**\n1. **Misleading Title and Claims**:\n   - The title \"Automatic Music Production\" is overly broad, as the work focuses narrowly on accompaniment. This misrepresents the scope.\n   - The claim of being the first to treat audio as images is false, as spectrogram-based methods are standard in MIR (e.g., music transcription, chord recognition).\n\n2. **Methodological Gaps**:\n   - **Source Separation**: The use of Demucs for separating tracks lacks critical details (e.g., model architecture, training status, artifacts, and their impact on results). The assumption that separated tracks are clean is unverified, which could bias experiments.\n   - **CycleGAN Details**: No architecture, hyperparameters, or training setup are provided, making reproducibility impossible.\n   - **Phase Retrieval**: The method for reconstructing waveforms from Mel-spectrograms is omitted, leading to unclear audio quality limitations (e.g., phase distortion).\n\n3. **Experimental Shortcomings**:\n   - **Dataset Issues**: The selection of 10,000 pop songs from FMA is poorly described (no song IDs, trimming details, or splits). The MusDB18 usage is unclear (e.g., train/test splits, duration).\n   - **Limited Scope**: Experiments focus only on bass→drums and voice→full arrangements. Reverse tasks (e.g., drums→bass) or multi-source combinations are missing, limiting generalizability.\n   - **Evaluation Flaws**: \n     - Metrics like STOI and FID are used without justification for their relevance to music quality.\n     - Human evaluation lacks inter-annotator agreement, cultural/genre diversity of experts, and analysis of source separation artifacts’ impact on ratings.\n\n4. **Literature and Justification**:\n   - The symbolic domain literature (e.g., MIDI-based generation) is ignored, weakening the motivation for raw audio approaches.\n   - Claims about raw audio’s superiority over symbolic representations are unsubstantiated and dismissive of existing tools (e.g., DAWs, synthesizers).\n\n5. **Reproducibility Barriers**:\n   - No code or dataset lists are provided.\n   - Key technical choices (e.g., spectrogram quantization, windowing) are omitted, hindering replication.\n\n### **Reviewer Consensus**\n- **Reviewer 1** and **Reviewer 3** emphasize critical gaps in methodology, reproducibility, and literature. \n- **Reviewer 2** acknowledges novelty but stresses the need for deeper experiments, comparisons, and evaluation rigor.\n- All reviewers agree the paper requires significant revisions before acceptance.\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile the problem of automatic accompaniment is compelling, the current submission lacks the rigor, clarity, and completeness expected of top-tier work. The overstatements in novelty, insufficient methodological details, and experimental limitations outweigh the paper’s contributions. The authors must address these issues (e.g., revise the title, provide full method details, expand experiments, and engage with symbolic domain literature) before resubmission.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

      "response": "Okay, let's tackle this. I need to decide whether to accept or reject this paper for a top-tier conference. Let me start by going through all the information provided.\n\nThe paper is about multitask learning, specifically a method called αVIL that dynamically adjusts task weights during training using parameter updates. The title mentions leveraging auxiliary tasks for multitask learning, and the abstract says it's the first to use model updates for task weight estimation. The keywords are multitask learning, meta-optimization, and deep learning.\n\nLooking at the reviewer comments, there are three reviewers. Let me go through each one's points.\n\nReviewer 1 says the paper is well-written and the method is intuitive but flexible. However, they have two major concerns: lack of theoretical justification and insufficient experimental results. The experiments don't consistently outperform baselines, and the baselines might be limited. They want more theory and better empirical validation.\n\nReviewer 2 thinks the method is ad hoc with little justification. They point out that dynamic task weighting isn't new (since DIW is a baseline) and that the results aren't convincing. The MNIST results are close to baselines, and on NLU tasks, there's no clear winner. They also mention some issues with the experimental setup, like task balancing in the baselines and the need for more analysis of learned weights. They suggest the method isn't novel enough and the results aren't strong enough for a top conference.\n\nReviewer 3 also has concerns. They question the distinction between α and task weights, the experimental setup (only one auxiliary task in vision), and the minor improvements over baselines. They argue the results are statistically insignificant and suggest rejection, recommending more experiments and ablations.\n\nNow, considering the standards of a top-tier conference, the paper needs to make a significant contribution, have strong theoretical backing, and demonstrate clear empirical superiority over existing methods. Let's break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the novelty. The authors claim it's the first to use model updates for task weight estimation. However, Reviewer 2 points out that dynamic task weighting isn't new, referencing DIW and meta-learning approaches like MAML. The method might not be sufficiently novel if it's building on existing ideas without a clear distinction. The algorithm's steps (like subtracting 1 from weights in line 11 of Algorithm 1) are criticized as ad hoc without clear intuition. The reviewers are questioning whether this is a meaningful advancement over prior work.\n\nNext, the experiments. The results on MNIST show minor improvements over baselines, within standard deviations. On NLU tasks, the results are mixed, with some tasks not showing clear gains. The baselines might not be comprehensive enough; for instance, if standard multitask learning isn't well-implemented (like not balancing task sizes), that could affect comparisons. The lack of statistical significance in results is a red flag. Top conferences require strong empirical evidence, and if the improvements aren't consistent or statistically significant, that's a problem.\n\nTheoretical justification is another issue. Reviewer 1 and 2 both mention the lack of formal analysis. Without theory, it's hard to understand why the method works and under what conditions. This is a gap that needs addressing, especially for a top venue where contributions are expected to be both empirically strong and theoretically grounded.\n\nThe experimental setup also has issues. Using only one auxiliary task in the vision experiments might not fully test the method's capabilities. The NLU tasks include some that are \"degenerate\" (like WNLI), which might skew results. The authors should have used more varied and challenging datasets. Additionally, the discrepancy between development and test set reporting (ensemble vs. average) could be confusing and needs clarification.\n\nThe reviewers' questions about the algorithm's components (like the role of α vs. task weights) suggest that the method's design isn't clearly explained. If even the reviewers are confused about the distinction between parameters, that indicates a lack of clarity in the paper's exposition. This could be improved with better explanations and ablation studies.\n\nConsidering all this, the paper's main issues are:\n\n1. **Novelty**: The method doesn't sufficiently distinguish itself from existing dynamic weighting approaches like DIW or meta-learning. The core idea of using parameter updates might be novel, but the implementation and justification are lacking.\n\n2. **Empirical Results**: The improvements over baselines are marginal and not statistically significant. The experiments don't convincingly demonstrate superiority across diverse tasks, especially in critical domains like NLU where results are mixed.\n\n3. **Theoretical Grounding**: Absence of formal analysis undermines the method's credibility. A top-tier conference would expect some theoretical insights or justification for why the approach works.\n\n4. **Clarity and Rigor**: The algorithm's steps are ad hoc, and the paper's explanations (like α vs. weights) are unclear. The experimental setup has inconsistencies and lacks thorough ablation studies.\n\n5. **Baseline Comparisons**: The baselines might not be the strongest possible. For instance, if standard multitask learning isn't properly implemented (e.g., task balancing), the comparisons could be misleading. The authors should have included more competitive baselines.\n\nGiven these points, while the paper has a novel angle and is well-written, the combination of insufficient theoretical backing, marginal empirical results, and questions about novelty and clarity makes it a borderline case. However, top conferences typically require a higher bar. The reviewers' consensus leans towards rejection, especially since two out of three recommend rejection or significant improvements. The third reviewer (Reviewer 1) suggests improvements but doesn't outright reject, but the other two are more critical.\n\nThe authors might need to address the theoretical gaps, perform more rigorous experiments with better baselines, clarify the method's components, and demonstrate statistically significant improvements. Without these, the paper doesn't meet the high standards required for acceptance at a top-tier conference.\n</think>\n\nThe paper proposes αVIL, a method for multitask learning that dynamically adjusts task weights using parameter updates. While the idea is novel in its use of model updates for weight estimation, several critical issues undermine its suitability for a top-tier conference:\n\n### Key Concerns:\n1. **Novelty and Justification**:\n   - The method’s core idea of using parameter updates for task weighting is claimed as novel, but reviewers question its distinction from existing dynamic weighting approaches (e.g., DIW, MAML). The algorithm’s steps (e.g., arbitrary adjustments in line 11 of Algorithm 1) are criticized as ad hoc, lacking clear intuition or theoretical grounding. The paper fails to convincingly argue why αVIL is a meaningful advancement over prior work.\n\n2. **Empirical Weaknesses**:\n   - **Marginal Improvements**: Results show only minor gains over baselines, often within statistical noise. On MNIST, performance is comparable to baselines, and on NLU tasks, results are mixed (e.g., underperforming on WNLI). The lack of statistical significance in reported results weakens the case for superiority.\n   - **Limited Baselines**: The comparison to standard multitask learning and DIW is insufficient. For instance, the standard multitask setup’s implementation (e.g., task balancing) is unclear, potentially skewing comparisons. More competitive baselines (e.g., recent meta-learning methods) should have been included.\n   - **Experimental Setup Flaws**: The vision experiments use only one auxiliary task, limiting generalizability. The discrepancy between development (average) and test (ensemble) reporting in Table 2 introduces confusion. Ablation studies and analysis of learned weights (e.g., sanity checks with random labels) are missing.\n\n3. **Theoretical Gaps**:\n   - No formal analysis or theoretical justification is provided for why αVIL works or under what conditions it outperforms baselines. This undermines its credibility and limits its potential impact.\n\n4. **Clarity and Rigor**:\n   - The distinction between α and task weights is unclear, as noted by Reviewer 3. The algorithm’s design choices (e.g., line 11 in Algorithm 1) lack intuitive explanations, and the prose occasionally suffers from minor formatting/grammatical issues (e.g., hyphenation, citation style).\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile the paper is well-written and addresses an important problem, its contributions are insufficient for a top-tier conference. The method’s novelty is questionable, the empirical results are underwhelming and statistically weak, and the lack of theoretical grounding and rigorous experimentation raises doubts about its robustness and significance. The reviewers’ critiques—particularly regarding the method’s ad hoc nature, marginal improvements, and lack of clarity—highlight critical shortcomings that would require substantial revisions beyond the scope of a conference submission.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

      "response": "Okay, let's tackle this. The paper is about a new GNN model called Global Node Attentions via Adaptive Spectral Filters, aiming to handle both assortative and disassortative graphs by using global attention through spectral filters. The reviewers have mixed opinions, so I need to weigh their points carefully.\n\nStarting with the strengths. The paper addresses a known limitation of GNNs in handling disassortative graphs where local homophily isn't present. The proposed method uses spectral filters to allow attention over any nodes, which is a novel approach. The experiments show better performance on disassortative datasets compared to existing methods, which is a strong point. Reviewer 2 and parts of Reviewer 3 highlight the clear exposition and thorough experiments, which are positives.\n\nNow the criticisms. Reviewer 1 and 4 point out issues with novelty. They argue that using attention for distant nodes isn't new, referencing prior works like Non-Local GNNs and ChevNet. The authors might not be sufficiently distinguishing their approach from these. Also, the complexity is a big concern. Reviewer 1 and 4 note that the method requires full eigen decomposition, leading to O(V²) complexity, which isn't scalable for large graphs. The rebuttal didn't seem to address this convincingly, especially since the reviewers think the claimed complexity might be incorrect. \n\nDatasets are another issue. Reviewer 3 and 4 mention that the disassortative datasets used are small. Larger benchmarks like actor or Cham from Geom-GCN weren't tested, possibly due to scalability. Without showing performance on bigger datasets, the practicality is questionable. Also, the lack of theoretical contributions and only node classification tasks might limit the paper's impact.\n\nThe authors tried to argue against ChevNet's limitations, but Reviewer 1 counters that ChevNet can handle distant nodes with proper K and the issue might be overfitting. If the model's main advantage is non-local attention, but existing methods already do that, the novelty is diluted. \n\nOn the flip side, the empirical results are solid where tested, and the method's performance on disassortative graphs is a clear improvement. However, the scalability problem is a major hurdle for a top-tier conference. Top conferences usually require both strong empirical results and manageable complexity. Since the paper's approach is computationally heavy and the rebuttal didn't resolve the complexity concerns, it might not meet the bar. \n\nAlso, the lack of theoretical analysis and limited dataset sizes (especially for disassortative cases) weaken the contribution. While the problem is important, the current submission's limitations in scalability and novelty might not be enough to justify acceptance over more scalable or novel approaches. \n\nSo, balancing the pros and cons, the main issues are the lack of novelty, high computational complexity, and insufficient empirical validation on larger datasets. These are significant drawbacks for a top conference like ICLR, which expects strong technical contributions and practical feasibility. Therefore, the paper should be rejected unless these points are addressed, but based on the provided reviews and rebuttal, it seems they weren't sufficiently resolved.\n</think>\n\nThe paper proposes a novel GNN architecture (GNAN) that addresses the limitation of traditional GNNs in handling disassortative graphs by introducing global attention via adaptive spectral filters. While the work has strengths, critical issues raised by reviewers undermine its acceptance for a top-tier conference:\n\n### Key Strengths:\n1. **Problem Relevance**: The focus on disassortative graphs is important, as existing GNNs struggle with heterophilic networks.\n2. **Empirical Results**: The model outperforms baselines on disassortative datasets and performs comparably on assortative ones, demonstrating practical utility.\n3. **Technical Motivation**: The integration of spectral graph theory and attention mechanisms is theoretically grounded and intuitive.\n\n### Major Concerns:\n1. **Novelty Deficit**:\n   - Reviewers 1, 3, and 4 argue that the core idea of global attention for distant nodes is not novel. Prior works like Non-Local GNNs and ChevNet already address similar challenges, and the proposed method’s distinction is marginal.\n   - The rebuttal did not sufficiently clarify how the approach overcomes limitations of existing methods (e.g., ChevNet’s overfitting or Non-Local GNNs’ scalability).\n\n2. **Scalability and Complexity**:\n   - The method requires full eigen-decomposition (O(V²) complexity), making it infeasible for large graphs. Reviewers 1, 3, and 4 highlight this as a critical flaw, especially since the paper claims to address scalability but fails to resolve it.\n   - The proposed \"sparsification\" (e.g., top-K attention) is under-explored in experiments, and the rebuttal does not clarify computational efficiency. This undermines claims of practicality for real-world applications.\n\n3. **Empirical Weaknesses**:\n   - **Dataset Size**: Disassortative benchmarks used are small (hundreds of nodes), and larger datasets (e.g., actor, Cham) were not tested, likely due to scalability issues. This limits the validity of the results.\n   - **Task Limitation**: Experiments focus solely on node classification, ignoring other tasks (e.g., link prediction) where disassortativity might have different impacts.\n   - **Lack of Theoretical Analysis**: The absence of theoretical guarantees or analysis weakens the contribution’s depth.\n\n4. **Technical Soundness**:\n   - Reviewer 1 disputes the authors’ critique of ChevNet, arguing that its failure stems from overfitting rather than architectural limitations. The rebuttal did not convincingly refute this.\n   - The complexity claims in Eq. (3) are contested, with reviewers asserting that the method cannot achieve linear scalability.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile the paper addresses an important problem and shows promising results on limited datasets, its lack of novelty, prohibitive computational complexity, and insufficient empirical validation on large-scale and diverse tasks prevent it from meeting the high bar of a top-tier conference like ICLR. The scalability issues alone render the method impractical for most real-world applications, and the incremental contribution over existing work further weakens its case.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

      "response": "Okay, let's tackle this. I need to decide whether to accept or reject this paper for a top-tier conference. Let me start by going through all the information provided.\n\nThe paper is about GG-GAN, a geometric graph generative adversarial network. The main contributions are addressing challenges in graph generation from a geometric perspective, ensuring permutation equivariance, scalability, and better handling of latent distributions. The abstract mentions it's a Wasserstein GAN, which is good because WGANs are known for better stability. The title and keywords suggest it's combining GANs with graph neural networks, which is a hot area.\n\nLooking at the reviewer comments, there are both positive and critical points. Let me go through each reviewer's points one by one.\n\nReviewer 1 is positive but has concerns about the experiments. They mention the datasets are small (9-node graphs) which might lead to many isomorphic graphs in the training set. Since there are only ~12k non-isomorphic graphs for 9 nodes, if the dataset has 10k graphs, there's a high chance of duplicates. This could affect model performance and the baselines. Also, the baselines in Table 1 don't clearly show superiority over existing methods like graphRNN, which does better in many cases. They also suggest comparing with NetGAN and simpler models like Watts-Strogatz or Barabási–Albert. This is a valid point because if the paper's method isn't better on standard baselines, especially on bigger graphs, it's a problem.\n\nReviewer 2 has several concerns. They point out mode collapse, which is a common issue in GANs. The paper doesn't provide evidence on diversity of generated graphs. Also, the edge dependencies are modeled via independent Bernoulli trials, so the claim about complex edge dependencies might be overblown. The theoretical parts like Corollary 1 and Proposition 1 are criticized as being too weak or not informative. The \"Avoiding Collision\" section is unclear, and the use of hand-crafted features might limit the model's capacity. They also question the necessity of unique z sampling for each node. These are technical issues that need addressing.\n\nReviewer 3 is positive, saying the method is inspiring and well-organized. That's a good sign, but since they're the only one with a strong positive, the other reviewers' points still matter.\n\nReviewer 4 is critical. They think the contributions aren't novel enough, as existing work like graphRNN and NetGAN already handle some aspects (isomorphism, scalability). The literature review is lacking, not comparing properly with recent methods like TagGen (Transformer-based). The theoretical parts are seen as not strongly connected to the method. Experiments don't show significant improvement over baselines, and they didn't compare with NetGAN, which is a strong baseline. Scalability claims need better justification since GANs might have O(n²) complexity. This is a big issue because if the method isn't actually faster, that's a major flaw.\n\nReviewer 5 also has mixed feedback. They like the clarity but note small datasets and unclear parts like the role of phi. They question the necessity of learning phi and suggest alternative methods for universality in GNNs. The experiments could be more convincing with larger graphs. They also point out typos and incomplete references, which are minor but show some sloppiness.\n\nPutting this together, the main issues are:\n\n1. **Experimental Weaknesses**: The datasets are too small (9-node graphs), leading to potential overfitting or isomorphic duplicates. The baselines aren't strong enough, missing key methods like NetGAN and simpler models. The results don't clearly show superiority over existing methods like graphRNN in most metrics. Without testing on larger graphs, scalability claims are unproven.\n\n2. **Theoretical Concerns**: Some proofs (Corollary 1, Proposition 1) are seen as weak or not well-explained. The edge independence issue undermines the claim of modeling complex dependencies. The role of phi and collision avoidance isn't clear, and the hand-crafted features might limit the model's effectiveness.\n\n3. **Novelty and Comparison**: The paper doesn't sufficiently distinguish itself from prior work. For instance, graphRNN already handles isomorphism, and NetGAN is a strong baseline not included. The literature review is lacking, making it hard to see the unique contributions.\n\n4. **Mode Collapse and Diversity**: Reviewers 2 and 4 point out that the paper doesn't address mode collapse, a critical issue in GANs. Without evidence of diverse outputs, the model's practicality is in doubt.\n\n5. **Scalability Claims**: The claim that GG-GAN is faster than autoregressive models might be questionable. If the method requires O(n²) parameters, it might not scale as claimed, especially compared to O(kn) autoregressive models. The experiments don't test this on large graphs, so the scalability isn't validated.\n\nOn the positive side, the paper is well-written, the idea is novel in combining geometric perspectives with GANs, and there's some theoretical backing. But the experiments are underwhelming, and the comparisons are not thorough. The reviewers' concerns about the datasets and baselines are significant because without proper validation on appropriate benchmarks, the claims can't be substantiated.\n\nTop-tier conferences require strong experimental validation and clear superiority over state-of-the-art. Here, the paper falls short in both. The small datasets and lack of comparison with key baselines like NetGAN and Transformer-based models weaken the contribution. The theoretical parts are also criticized as not being robust enough. While the idea is interesting, the current submission doesn't meet the high standards needed for acceptance without major revisions.\n\nTherefore, considering all the points, especially the experimental shortcomings and lack of sufficient novelty, the paper should be rejected. The authors need to address the dataset size, include more competitive baselines, clarify their theoretical claims, and provide evidence on scalability and diversity before it's ready for a top conference.\n</think>\n\nThe paper proposes GG-GAN, a geometric graph generative adversarial network designed to address challenges in graph generation, such as isomorphism consistency and scalability. While the idea is novel and the paper is well-written, several critical issues undermine its suitability for a top-tier conference:\n\n### Key Concerns:\n1. **Experimental Weaknesses**:\n   - **Dataset Limitations**: The use of small real-world datasets (9-node graphs) and an artificial 20-node dataset raises concerns about overfitting and isomorphic duplicates. With only ~12,000 non-isomorphic graphs for 9-node graphs, the training/test sets likely contain many duplicates, which can skew results and fail to demonstrate scalability.\n   - **Incomplete Baselines**: The comparison with graphRNN and other methods (e.g., NetGAN, Watts-Strogatz models) is insufficient. GG-GAN only outperforms baselines in a single metric (MMD), while graphRNN performs better in most cases. The absence of NetGAN, a strong GAN-based baseline, and simpler models weakens the results.\n   - **Lack of Large-Scale Testing**: Scalability claims (\"tens of thousands of nodes\") are unvalidated, as experiments are limited to small graphs. Without evidence on medium/large graphs, scalability remains unproven.\n\n2. **Theoretical and Methodological Flaws**:\n   - **Edge Independence**: The edge generation via independent Bernoulli trials contradicts the claim of modeling \"complex edge dependencies,\" undermining a key contribution.\n   - **Weak Theoretical Claims**: Corollary 1 and Proposition 1 are criticized as trivial or poorly justified. The role of hand-crafted features and the \"Avoiding Collision\" mechanism is unclear, raising questions about the model's design.\n   - **Mode Collapse and Diversity**: No evidence is provided to address mode collapse, a critical issue in GANs. The paper does not demonstrate diversity in generated graphs, which is essential for practical applications.\n\n3. **Novelty and Comparison**:\n   - **Overlapping Contributions**: Existing methods like graphRNN and NetGAN already address isomorphism and scalability. The paper fails to clearly distinguish its contributions from prior work, particularly in the literature review.\n   - **Scalability Claims**: The assertion that GG-GAN is faster than autoregressive models is questionable, as GANs typically require O(n²) parameter space. Without runtime comparisons against recent Transformer-based models (e.g., TagGen), scalability claims are unconvincing.\n\n4. **Technical and Clarity Issues**:\n   - **Unclear Mechanisms**: Sections like \"Avoiding Collision\" and the role of parameter φ lack theoretical justification or empirical analysis.\n   - **Implementation Details**: Questions about z-sampling and φ learning remain unanswered, complicating reproducibility.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile GG-GAN introduces an interesting geometric perspective for graph generation, the paper’s experimental validation is insufficient, and its theoretical claims are underdeveloped. The lack of rigorous comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, small datasets, and unresolved methodological flaws (e.g., edge independence, mode collapse) prevent it from meeting the high standards of a top-tier conference. Addressing these issues would require substantial revisions beyond the scope of a minor rebuttal.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

      "response": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate whether this paper should be accepted or rejected for a top-tier conference. I need to go through all the provided information carefully.\n\nStarting with the paper's title and abstract. The main contribution is a new Reduction Algorithm for ReLU networks based on regularization theory. They mention experiments showing significant neuron reduction with minimal accuracy loss. The keywords include things like compression, pruning, and interpretability, which are hot topics, so that's a plus.\n\nNow, looking at the reviewer comments. There are six reviewers here, and their feedback is mostly negative, but let me check each one.\n\nReviewer 1: They had some initial concerns but were addressed. However, they still want better explanations of the motivation and more experiments. They mention that the method needs to be compared to state-of-the-art pruning techniques both theoretically and experimentally. So, the experiments are insufficient, and the presentation needs work.\n\nReviewer 2: Points out poor writing, vague contributions, and experiments that aren't convincing. They specifically mention toy datasets and MNIST without proper comparisons. This is a red flag because top conferences require strong experimental validation.\n\nReviewer 3: Also votes for rejection. They note that the paper references an unpublished work, which is a problem because reviewers can't verify those claims. The proposed architecture is similar to existing work (highway networks), and experiments are not strong enough. They suggest experiments on CIFAR instead of just MNIST. Typos and grammatical issues are mentioned too.\n\nReviewer 4: Major issues here include clarity and correctness. The paper uses footnotes for important concepts, which is bad practice. They also don't compare with standard pruning baselines (like magnitude-based pruning). The experiments are limited, and there are undefined terms and equations. The method claims to preserve outputs exactly but uses approximations, which is conflicting. The theory section references an unpublished paper, making it hard to verify. The reviewer also points out that some sections are redundant and need reorganization.\n\nReviewer 5: Agrees the method is novel but the motivation is lacking. Experiments are insufficient (only toy and MNIST), and there's no comparison to other pruning methods. The third step of their algorithm (weighted k-means) isn't explained well, making the validity questionable. The paper's reliance on unpublished work is a big issue here too. They also mention typos and unclear explanations, like the stack layer's architecture.\n\nReviewer 6: Similar to others, the paper is poorly written and hard to follow. They note that parts of the method (like removing dead neurons and combining always-active ones) aren't novel. The experiments are on simple datasets, and the \"stack network\" is just a residual network with affine projections, which isn't new. The P-functional isn't defined, and there's a lack of clear connection between equations and the algorithm.\n\nPutting this all together, the common themes are:\n\n1. **Insufficient Experiments**: All reviewers point out that the experiments are on toy datasets and MNIST, which isn't enough for a top conference. They need to show results on more complex datasets like CIFAR or ImageNet. Also, no comparison with existing pruning methods (e.g., magnitude pruning, Hessian-based, etc.) which is a major gap.\n\n2. **Clarity and Presentation Issues**: The paper is poorly written with typos, undefined terms, and unclear explanations. Sections like the theory part rely on an unpublished work, making it hard for reviewers to assess validity. The method's steps, especially the clustering part, aren't well-explained, leading to confusion about how it works and why it's effective.\n\n3. **Novelty Concerns**: Some aspects of the method (like removing dead neurons) are not novel. The architecture (stack network) is similar to existing ones like highway networks, so the contribution might not be significant enough.\n\n4. **Theoretical Gaps**: The connection between the regularization theory and the pruning algorithm isn't clearly demonstrated. The proofs or derivations are missing, and relying on an unpublished work undermines the credibility.\n\n5. **Lack of Rigorous Analysis**: The paper claims to preserve the function almost exactly, but the experiments use approximations without justification. The complexity of the algorithm isn't analyzed, and hyperparameters aren't tested.\n\nConsidering top-tier conference standards, the paper needs to have strong technical contributions, clear presentation, thorough experiments, and comparisons. Here, the experiments are weak, the writing is poor, and the novelty is questionable. The reliance on an unpublished work adds uncertainty. While the idea of neuron pruning based on ReLU properties is interesting, the execution and validation fall short.\n\nThe reviewers' consensus is towards rejection, with multiple pointing out critical flaws that can't be fixed in a minor revision. The authors need to address the experiments, clarify the method, and ensure their contributions are novel and properly supported. Since these are major issues, especially for a top conference, the paper likely doesn't meet the bar.\n</think>\n\nThe paper proposes a neuron reduction algorithm for ReLU networks based on regularization theory, aiming to significantly reduce neurons while preserving accuracy. However, the reviewers' critiques highlight critical shortcomings that prevent the paper from meeting the standards of a top-tier conference:\n\n### Key Issues:\n1. **Insufficient Experiments**:\n   - Experiments are limited to toy datasets and MNIST, which are insufficient to demonstrate the method's effectiveness on complex, real-world tasks. \n   - No comparisons with state-of-the-art pruning techniques (e.g., magnitude-based, Hessian-based, or gradient-norm methods) are provided, making it impossible to assess the method’s superiority.\n   - The experiments lack statistical rigor (e.g., standard errors, significance tests) and fail to address computational complexity or hyperparameter sensitivity.\n\n2. **Clarity and Presentation**:\n   - The paper is poorly written, with numerous typos, grammatical errors, and undefined terms (e.g., \"P-functional,\" \"stack layer,\" \"bottleneck architecture\"). \n   - Critical details are omitted or buried in footnotes, and key derivations (e.g., equivalence of Equations 1 and 2) are missing. \n   - The method’s third step (weighted k-means clustering) is inadequately explained, raising concerns about its validity and implementation.\n\n3. **Novelty and Originality**:\n   - Key components of the method (e.g., removing \"dead\" neurons or combining \"always active\" neurons) are not novel and have been explored in prior work (e.g., highway networks). \n   - The proposed \"stack network\" architecture is described as redundant or similar to existing techniques, undermining its originality.\n\n4. **Theoretical Gaps**:\n   - The paper heavily references an **unpublished work** by the authors to justify its theoretical claims, making it impossible for reviewers to verify the foundational assumptions. \n   - The connection between regularization theory and the pruning algorithm is not rigorously demonstrated, and critical proofs (e.g., for Carathéodory’s theorem application) are omitted. \n   - The method claims to preserve the learned function \"almost exactly,\" but the experiments rely on approximations (e.g., magnitude-based pruning) without justification.\n\n5. **Technical Concerns**:\n   - The algorithm’s computational complexity is not analyzed, and the approximation steps (e.g., clustering) lack theoretical justification. \n   - The motivation for certain design choices (e.g., bottleneck architectures) is unclear, and figures (e.g., Figure 6) are poorly presented.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile the paper introduces an interesting idea for neuron reduction in ReLU networks, its execution falls short in multiple critical areas. The lack of thorough experiments, unclear presentation, reliance on unpublished work, and insufficient novelty make it difficult to evaluate the method’s validity and significance. These issues are particularly problematic for a top-tier conference, which demands rigorous technical contributions, clear exposition, and strong empirical validation. The reviewers’ consensus, supported by detailed critiques, strongly leans toward rejection.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

      "response": "Okay, let's tackle this. I need to decide whether to accept or reject this paper for a top-tier conference. Let me start by going through all the information provided.\n\nThe paper's title is about uncertainty estimation for deep image classifiers on out-of-distribution (OOD) data. The abstract mentions they propose a post-hoc calibration method using outlier exposure, improving on Ovadia et al.'s benchmarks. The key points are handling overconfidence in OOD scenarios and using a calibration set with corrupted data.\n\nLooking at the reviewers' comments, there's a mix of positive and critical feedback. Let me break down each reviewer's points.\n\nReviewer 1 was initially critical, pointing out that the method assumes knowledge of possible novel distributions, which isn't realistic. They argue that existing methods don't have this assumption, making the problem simpler and less interesting. However, after the rebuttal, they updated their score but still had concerns about incomplete baselines. They mention that if you have prior knowledge of possible distributions, data augmentation would be a better approach. Also, they note that the method's performance might not be strong with single images and that some recent related work wasn't cited.\n\nReviewer 2 found the method simple and effective, with consistent improvements. They liked the idea of transferring calibration from one corruption type to others. However, they questioned the motivation for the multiple image method and suggested more experiments on realistic OOD cases beyond artificial corruptions. They also pointed out unclear explanations, like why contrast was chosen for calibration and the need for clearer terminology (e.g., p_max). After the rebuttal, they remained positive but wanted more experiments.\n\nReviewer 3 was more negative. They found the paper's terminology unclear (like p_max not being defined) and the method's application to diverse corruptions unconvincing. They questioned why contrast was chosen and whether the method works for other corruptions like translations. They thought the presentation was unclear and the generalization to new corruptions wasn't well-demonstrated, leading to a lower score.\n\nReviewer 4 was positive post-rebuttal, noting that the contrast corruption used in validation worked well across many test corruptions. They wanted more analysis on why this happens but appreciated the results. They also mentioned that the method's performance on completely OOD data (like SVHN for CIFAR-10) wasn't shown, which is a gap.\n\nThe summary points out strengths like the method being post-hoc and effective for some corruptions, but weaknesses include reliance on predefined corruptions and lack of evaluation on completely different OOD data. The reviewers also highlighted unclear notation and methodology.\n\nNow, considering the standards of a top-tier conference, the paper needs to make a significant contribution, have thorough evaluations, and address key limitations. The main issues here are:\n\n1. **Assumption of Known Corruption Types**: Reviewer 1's initial critique is strong. The method assumes possible distributions are known, which isn't the case in real-world scenarios. This limits applicability and makes the problem less challenging than existing work. The rebuttal might have addressed some points, but the core issue remains.\n\n2. **Lack of Generalization**: The method works when the test corruption is somewhat similar to the calibration set (like contrast), but how does it handle entirely new or unseen corruptions? The reviewers pointed out that experiments on completely OOD data (e.g., SVHN) are missing. Without showing effectiveness beyond predefined corruptions, the contribution is limited.\n\n3. **Clarity and Presentation**: Multiple reviewers noted unclear explanations, undefined terms (like p_max), and confusing notation. A top-tier paper needs to be well-written and precise, especially in methodology.\n\n4. **Baseline Comparisons**: Reviewer 1 and 2 mentioned incomplete baselines. The authors didn't compare against recent works like Park et al. and Wang et al., which might have similar approaches. Including these could strengthen the paper, but their absence is a problem.\n\n5. **Motivation for Multiple Image Method**: Reviewer 2 and 3 questioned why the multiple image method is needed and its justification. The authors need to better explain this aspect.\n\nHowever, the paper does have merits. The method is simple and shows consistent improvements over Ovadia's benchmarks. The idea of using outlier exposure for calibration is novel in this context, and the results on corrupted datasets are promising. The experiments in the rebuttal (Figures 7 and 8) showing performance on other corruptions and OOD data (like SVHN) might address some concerns, but the summary mentions these weren't fully evaluated yet.\n\nTop conferences require that the work addresses a significant problem, has strong methodology, and thorough evaluations. Here, the core limitation is the assumption of known distributions, which makes the problem easier and less general. While the method is an improvement in specific scenarios, the lack of handling truly unknown distributions and the dependency on predefined corruptions are major drawbacks. Additionally, the clarity issues and incomplete baselines weaken the paper's case.\n\nOn the other hand, if the method provides a meaningful step forward in a niche area (calibration with known corruption types), and the experiments are solid within that scope, maybe it's borderline. But top-tier conferences usually expect more general solutions. Since the problem is altered by the assumption, and the method doesn't handle unanticipated shifts, it might not meet the high bar.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the paper has potential but falls short due to the critical limitations pointed out by Reviewer 1 and others. The assumption of known distributions fundamentally changes the problem's difficulty, making the contribution less impactful for real-world applications where such knowledge isn't available. Without addressing this, it's probably not suitable for a top-tier conference.\n</think>\n\nThe paper proposes a post-hoc calibration method for improving uncertainty estimates on out-of-distribution (OOD) data, leveraging outlier exposure with corrupted data. While the method shows promise in specific scenarios, several critical issues undermine its suitability for a top-tier conference:\n\n### Key Strengths:\n1. **Novelty and Simplicity**: The approach is straightforward and demonstrates consistent improvements over prior work (e.g., Ovadia et al.) on benchmark corrupted datasets. The idea of using contrast-corrupted calibration sets is novel and provides a practical post-hoc solution.\n2. **Empirical Results**: The method achieves lower Expected Calibration Error (ECE) on corrupted data (e.g., CIFAR-10C, ImageNet-C) and shows some generalization to unseen corruptions (e.g., translations, rotations) and OOD datasets (e.g., SVHN), as noted in the rebuttal.\n3. **Broader Applicability**: As a post-hoc method, it can be applied to any model, aligning with the need for calibration techniques that are model-agnostic.\n\n### Major Weaknesses:\n1. **Problem Assumption Flaw**: The core limitation is the **assumption that possible OOD distributions are known** (e.g., predefined corruptions like contrast, brightness). This fundamentally alters the problem’s difficulty, as real-world applications require handling *unanticipated* distribution shifts. Reviewer 1 correctly argues that this assumption reduces the problem’s relevance, as existing methods aim to address unknown shifts without prior knowledge. The rebuttal did not sufficiently address this critique.\n2. **Limited Generalization**: While the method works for corruptions similar to the calibration set (e.g., contrast), its performance on entirely novel or distant corruptions (e.g., SVHN for CIFAR-10) remains under-evaluated. The summary notes that experiments on such cases are missing, weakening claims of robustness.\n3. **Clarity and Presentation**: Multiple reviewers highlighted unclear terminology (e.g., undefined $p_{max}$), confusing notation (e.g., $P^{CAL,j}_m$), and lack of formal descriptions (e.g., Equation 3 derivation). A top-tier paper requires rigorous and precise exposition.\n4. **Incomplete Baselines**: The authors omitted recent related work (e.g., Park et al., Wang et al.) and did not compare against calibration under distribution shift techniques (e.g., using unsupervised domain adaptation). This undermines the method’s novelty and competitiveness.\n5. **Motivation Gaps**: The rationale for choosing contrast as the calibration set and the justification for the \"multiple image method\" remain under-explained. Reviewers questioned the intuition behind these choices, which are critical for reproducibility and trust in the method.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile the paper introduces an interesting idea and shows improvements in specific scenarios, its reliance on **predefined distributions** and lack of evaluation on truly unanticipated shifts severely limit its practical relevance. The method’s success hinges on an unrealistic assumption, making it less impactful for real-world applications. Additionally, clarity issues and incomplete baselines further weaken its case for a top-tier venue. These shortcomings outweigh the contributions, particularly in a competitive conference setting where the bar for significance and rigor is high.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

Let me start by going through all the information provided.\n\nThe paper's title is MQES: Max-Q Entropy Search for Efficient Exploration in Continuous Reinforcement Learning. The abstract mentions they're using an information-theoretic approach to handle both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in continuous action spaces, which is a good angle. They compare against SAC and DSAC and claim better performance on Mujoco. \n\nLooking at the reviewer comments, there are five reviewers. Let me go through each one's points.\n\nReviewer 1 points out several issues. The method isn't clearly presented as a general module for existing algorithms like SAC. The parameterization of policies π_E and π_T isn't clear. The policy update keeps covariance fixed, which might hinder adaptive exploration. Experiments are preliminary with no hyperparameter ablation, and there are minor issues like equations needing clarification. \n\nReviewer 2 says the paper is well-written but needs more details on the target policy and hyperparameters. The empirical results aren't discussed enough, and comparisons to DSAC are too close. They also mention the horizon is set to 100 instead of 1000, which is standard.\n\nReviewer 3 notes that MQES doesn't show significant improvement over DSAC except in a couple of cases. The horizon choice is questioned again. They want ablation studies on using only one type of uncertainty. Writing issues include unclear equations and notation, like in Eq. 8 and 9. Also, the mutual information terms are confusing.\n\nReviewer 4 criticizes the writing as unclear and haphazard, with too many equations without context. They mention lack of ablations to support claims, and the evaluation uses only 5 seeds, which might not be statistically significant. They also suggest including OAC as a baseline since it outperforms SAC.\n\nReviewer 5 thinks the idea is novel but the paper is hard to follow. They point out unclear terminology and notation issues, especially in Section 4.1. The method's reliance on Q* might not help in sparse-reward settings. Empirical evaluation is limited, not comparing to methods like VIME. Also, the abstract mentions \"recently\" for optimism, which isn't accurate since UCB is older. Missing references like VIME and DORA are noted. They also correct a term in Section 3.2.\n\nNow, considering all these points. The main strengths are the novel approach combining information theory with distributional RL for continuous spaces, and some empirical results showing improvement over SAC and DSAC. However, the weaknesses are significant. \n\nFirst, the writing and clarity issues are a big problem. Multiple reviewers (especially 4 and 5) mention that the paper is hard to follow, with unclear notation and explanations. For a top-tier conference, clarity is crucial. If the method isn't presented clearly, it's hard for others to build on it or verify the claims.\n\nSecond, the experiments are underwhelming. The performance gains over DSAC are marginal except in a few cases. The reviewers point out that the baselines might not be comprehensive (like missing OAC and VIME). Also, the evaluation uses a shorter horizon (100 vs 1000), which might not reflect real-world scenarios. The lack of ablation studies on key components like hyperparameters (α, β, C) and the effect of using only one type of uncertainty is a red flag. Without these, it's hard to assess the method's robustness and the contribution's significance.\n\nThird, the method's theoretical underpinnings have some gaps. Reviewers 1 and 3 note that the policy's covariance isn't updated, which might limit exploration adaptability. The mutual information formulation in equations like 8 and 9 is confusing, suggesting possible flaws in the derivation or explanation.\n\nFourth, the paper's novelty might be overstated. Reviewer 5 mentions that relying on Q* for exploration ties it to the reward, which might not be ideal for exploration in sparse-reward tasks. The authors don't address this limitation, which is a key aspect of exploration methods.\n\nConsidering all these points, the paper has a promising idea but is let down by unclear presentation, insufficient empirical validation, and potential theoretical gaps. Top-tier conferences require both strong contributions and rigorous presentation. The current state of the paper doesn't meet these standards. The reviewers' consensus seems to lean towards rejection unless major revisions are made, but given the feedback, especially on clarity and experiments, it's unlikely to be accepted in its current form.\n</think>\n\nThe paper proposes MQES, an exploration method for continuous RL that combines information-theoretic principles with distributional RL to address aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. While the idea is novel and the empirical results show marginal improvements over baselines like SAC and DSAC in some Mujoco tasks, the paper faces significant shortcomings that undermine its acceptance at a top-tier conference. \n\n### Key Issues:\n1. **Clarity and Presentation**: Multiple reviewers (Reviewers 1, 3, 4, 5) highlight severe clarity issues. The paper’s notation, equations (e.g., Eqs. 8, 9, 20), and explanations are confusing or inconsistent. Critical concepts like mutual information formulation, policy parameterization (π_E and π_T), and hyperparameters (e.g., α, β, C) are poorly explained. The lack of a clear, logical flow and insufficient context for equations make the method difficult to follow, which is unacceptable for a top-tier venue.\n\n2. **Empirical Evaluation**: \n   - **Limited Baselines**: The comparison to DSAC and SAC is insufficient. Key baselines like OAC and VIME (information-theoretic exploration) are missing, weakening the significance of the results.\n   - **Marginal Performance Gains**: MQES outperforms baselines only in a few environments (e.g., Sparse-HalfCheetah-v2). In most cases, performance is comparable to DSAC, raising questions about the method’s novelty and practical impact.\n   - **Incomplete Analysis**: No ablation studies on hyperparameters (e.g., uncertainty ratio set to 1.6) or the effect of using only one type of uncertainty (aleatoric/epistemic) are provided. The choice of a 100-step horizon instead of the standard 1000 steps is unexplained, and results on longer horizons are absent.\n   - **Statistical Rigor**: Only 5 seeds are used, and no statistical tests (e.g., p-values) are reported, casting doubt on the robustness of the results.\n\n3. **Theoretical and Methodological Gaps**:\n   - The policy update in Eq. 18 fixes the covariance, limiting adaptive exploration over time.\n   - The mutual information objective’s derivation and connection to exploration are unclear (e.g., confusing notation in Eq. 9).\n   - The method’s reliance on Q* ties exploration to the reward signal, potentially limiting its utility in sparse-reward settings—a critical flaw for exploration methods.\n\n4. **Writing and Technical Issues**: \n   - The abstract inaccurately claims \"recently\" for optimism principles, which are well-established (e.g., UCB).\n   - Missing references (e.g., VIME, DORA) and incorrect terminology (e.g., \"Bellman optimality operator\" misused) suggest a lack of thorough literature review.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile MQES introduces an interesting idea, the paper’s lack of clarity, insufficient empirical validation, and unresolved theoretical/methodological issues outweigh its contributions. Top-tier conferences demand rigorous presentation, thorough experiments, and clear evidence of superiority over state-of-the-art methods. The current submission fails to meet these standards and requires substantial revisions to address the reviewers’ concerns.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

Let me start by going through all the information provided.\n\nThe paper is titled \"CANVASEMB: Learning Layout Representation with Large-scale Pre-training for Graphic Design.\" The main contributions seem to be a new method for layout representation using a transformer-based model, a large dataset of over a million slides, and some downstream tasks like element role labeling and image captioning. The reviewers have given their comments, so I need to weigh their points.\n\nFirst, looking at the strengths. Reviewer 1 points out the large dataset is a big plus, especially since previous works used smaller datasets. The dataset's scale is a significant contribution. The method uses transformers, which are state-of-the-art in NLP, so applying them here is innovative. The paper also shows SOTA performance on their proposed tasks. Reviewer 2 mentions the originality in using transformers for layout, even if the motivation isn't fully explained. The dataset's potential is highlighted by all reviewers, and the idea of pre-training for downstream tasks is solid.\n\nNow the weaknesses. Reviewer 1 notes insufficient details on dataset construction—like how elements are parsed, whether it's fully automatic, and specifics on data stats. That's a problem because reproducibility and understanding the dataset's quality are crucial. Also, the pre-training and fine-tuning setup isn't clear. For example, are the downstream tasks using the same dataset as pre-training? That could be an issue if there's overlap, making results less convincing.\n\nReviewer 2 points out several issues. The related work section is weak; they didn't compare properly with prior works like Cao et al. 2019, which also did pre-training but on a smaller scale. The paper claims to be the first in pre-training, but that's not accurate. Also, the method's technical details are sparse. The transformer architecture isn't well-explained, and there's no figure showing the model structure. The evaluation is lacking: they only compare against a decision tree, not neural baselines like LayoutGAN or GNNs. The image captioning task is actually a binary classification, which might not be a strong test. The paper also doesn't address why transformers are better than GNNs here, especially since GNNs might handle structural data more efficiently.\n\nReviewer 3 echoes some of these points. The evaluation is too limited. The tasks chosen (role labeling and image captioning) are simple, and the baselines are weak. The layout auto-completion and retrieval tasks aren't as comprehensive as prior work. They also mention that the authors didn't compare against existing methods like DesignScape or LayoutGAN, making it hard to see the real impact. The dataset's release is mentioned but not confirmed, which is a concern for reproducibility.\n\nPutting this together: The paper has a strong contribution in the dataset and applying transformers to layout, but the execution has several flaws. The dataset details are missing, which is a red flag for a top conference. The evaluation is not thorough enough—key baselines are missing, and the tasks chosen might not showcase the model's full potential. The method's technical description is lacking, making it hard to replicate or understand the innovations. The related work is insufficient, not addressing prior pre-training approaches properly.\n\nHowever, the dataset's size and the novel application of transformers could still be impactful. But for a top-tier conference, the paper needs to meet higher standards in methodology, evaluation, and clarity. The reviewers' concerns about the weak baselines, incomplete dataset description, and insufficient technical details are significant. Without addressing these, the paper might not be ready for acceptance. The authors need to provide more details on their dataset, compare against stronger baselines, and better explain their model's architecture and advantages over existing methods like GNNs.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the paper has potential but falls short in critical areas required for a top conference. The reviewers' points highlight necessary improvements that aren't present in the current submission. Therefore, it should be rejected unless these issues are addressed in a revised version. Since the question is about the current submission, the decision would be to reject.\n</think>\n\nThe paper proposes CANVASEMB, a transformer-based framework for learning layout representations through large-scale pre-training on a novel dataset of over 1 million parsed slides. While the work has notable strengths, several critical shortcomings in methodology, evaluation, and clarity hinder its acceptance at a top-tier conference. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### **Strengths**:\n1. **Dataset Contribution**: The large-scale slide dataset is a significant contribution, addressing the scarcity of layout data in prior work. Its potential for enabling downstream tasks is promising.\n2. **Novel Approach**: Applying transformers to layout representation learning is innovative, leveraging self-supervised pre-training—a departure from earlier methods like decision trees or GANs.\n3. **Downstream Tasks**: The paper introduces two tasks (element role labeling and image captioning) with human-labeled data, demonstrating practical utility.\n\n### **Major Weaknesses**:\n1. **Insufficient Dataset Details**:\n   - The dataset construction process lacks transparency (e.g., parsing methods, element statistics, template diversity, and whether role labeling data overlaps with pre-training data). This undermines reproducibility and the validity of results.\n   - Missing critical metadata (e.g., maximum elements per slide, property completeness) makes it unclear if the dataset justifies the transformer architecture’s complexity.\n\n2. **Weak Evaluation**:\n   - **Baselines**: The comparison is limited to a decision-tree baseline, ignoring stronger neural baselines like LayoutGAN, GNNs, or Cao et al. (SIGGRAPH 2019). This weakens the claim of SOTA performance.\n   - **Task Design**: The \"image captioning\" task is a binary classification, and \"layout auto-completion\" only predicts single attributes, not full layouts. These tasks are insufficient to validate the model’s capabilities.\n   - **Missing Comparisons**: The paper does not contrast with prior pre-training work (e.g., Cao et al. 2019) or explain why transformers outperform GNNs, which are better suited for structural data and require less data.\n\n3. **Technical and Clarity Issues**:\n   - The transformer architecture is poorly described (no figures, equations, or attention mechanisms explained), making it hard to replicate or assess innovation.\n   - The abstract and introduction ambiguously use \"pre-training,\" conflating the model’s training process with its application.\n   - The related work section is disjointed and fails to clearly differentiate CANVASEMB from prior work.\n\n4. **Lack of Rigorous Analysis**:\n   - The evaluation lacks geometric/color property predictions and qualitative visualizations, which are critical for layout tasks.\n   - The layout retrieval experiment relies on subjective manual scoring, which is unreliable.\n\n### **Conclusion**:\nWhile CANVASEMB introduces a valuable dataset and a novel transformer-based approach, the paper’s technical gaps, weak evaluation, and insufficient comparisons with state-of-the-art methods prevent it from meeting the standards of a top-tier conference. The dataset’s potential is undermined by missing details, and the methodology’s novelty is not sufficiently justified. Addressing these issues in a revised version could strengthen the work, but as currently presented, it falls short.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

      "response": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate whether this paper should be accepted or rejected for a top-tier conference. Let me start by going through all the provided information carefully.\n\nFirst, the paper's title and abstract. The main contribution seems to be a new algorithm for reducing the number of neurons in ReLU networks using regularization theory. They mention experiments on toy data and MNIST, showing significant reduction with minimal accuracy loss. \n\nNow, looking at the reviewer comments. There are six reviewers here, and their feedback is mostly negative, though some have constructive points. Let me go through each reviewer's points one by one.\n\nReviewer 1: They had initial concerns but were addressed. However, they still think the motivation needs more explanation. Also, they point out that the method isn't tested on complex datasets and lacks comparison to state-of-the-art pruning techniques. So, while the math is okay now, the experiments and comparisons are lacking.\n\nReviewer 2: Criticizes the writing quality, organization, vague contributions, and positioning against existing work. The experiments are called \"not convincing\" because they're on toy and MNIST without proper comparisons. This is a big red flag for a top conference, which usually expects strong experiments and clear contributions.\n\nReviewer 3: Also votes for rejection. They mention the paper references an unpublished work, which is a problem because it's hard to verify those claims. The proposed architecture is similar to highway networks, so originality is an issue. Experiments on MNIST and a toy dataset aren't enough; they suggest CIFAR is needed. Typos and other issues are noted too.\n\nReviewer 4: Points out clarity issues, missing definitions, and the use of footnotes instead of main text explanations. The lack of comparison with standard pruning baselines (like magnitude-based pruning) is a major issue. The experiments are insufficient, and there are questions about the theory's basis (like referencing an unpublished paper and needing to cite other works). The method's approximation steps aren't justified, and the paper has many typos.\n\nReviewer 5: Agrees the method is novel but says the motivation is missing, experiments are weak (only toy and MNIST), and key parts rely on unpublished work which can't be verified. The pruning steps 1 and 2 are trivial, and step 3's equations are unclear. Without proper validation or comparisons, they can't confirm correctness. Presentation issues and lack of necessary details (like equations for the stack layer) hurt the paper.\n\nReviewer 6: Calls the writing unclear and points out that parts of the method (like the stack network) are just residual networks with affine projections, which isn't novel. The experiments are basic (toy and MNIST), and key terms like \"P-FUNCTIONAL\" aren't defined. The link between equations and the algorithm isn't clear, making it hard to follow.\n\nPutting this all together, the common themes are:\n\n1. **Weak Experiments**: All reviewers note that the experiments are insufficient. MNIST is considered too simple for a top conference, especially when pruning methods are evaluated on more complex datasets like CIFAR. The lack of comparison to existing pruning techniques (magnitude, Hessian, etc.) is a major gap.\n\n2. **Clarity and Presentation Issues**: Multiple reviewers mention poor writing, unclear explanations, missing definitions, and reliance on footnotes. The paper is hard to follow, which is a problem for reproducibility and understanding the contribution.\n\n3. **Lack of Novelty/Originality**: The method's components (like removing dead neurons or combining always-active ones) are seen as not novel. The architecture (stack network) is similar to existing work (highway networks), and the theoretical basis references an unpublished paper, which undermines credibility.\n\n4. **Theoretical Gaps**: The reliance on an unpublished work makes it hard to verify the claims. Key parts of the method (like the weighted k-means step) aren't well-explained or justified, leading to questions about validity.\n\n5. **Insufficient Contributions**: The contributions are vague, and the paper doesn't clearly position itself against the state of the art. The experiments don't demonstrate superiority over existing methods, which is crucial for acceptance.\n\nConsidering top-tier conferences like NeurIPS or ICML, the bar is high. Papers need strong, novel contributions, rigorous experiments, and clear writing. This paper falls short in multiple areas. The experiments are underwhelming, the method isn't sufficiently novel, and there are significant issues with presentation and theoretical grounding. While the idea of neuron pruning using regularization is interesting, the execution here doesn't meet the standards required. The reviewers' consensus leans heavily towards rejection, especially given the repeated criticisms across multiple dimensions.\n</think>\n\nThe paper proposes a neuron reduction algorithm for ReLU networks based on regularization theory, aiming to significantly reduce neurons while preserving accuracy. However, the paper faces critical shortcomings that undermine its suitability for a top-tier conference:\n\n### Key Issues:\n1. **Weak Experiments and Comparisons**:\n   - Experiments are limited to toy datasets and MNIST, which are insufficient for demonstrating the method's effectiveness on complex, real-world tasks (e.g., CIFAR-10/100). \n   - No comparisons with state-of-the-art pruning techniques (e.g., magnitude-based, Hessian-based, or gradient-norm methods) are provided, making it impossible to assess the algorithm's superiority or novelty.\n   - The MNIST results lack statistical rigor (e.g., standard errors) and fail to show compelling improvements over baselines.\n\n2. **Clarity and Presentation**:\n   - The paper is poorly organized, with vague contributions and unclear explanations. Critical details (e.g., definitions of the \"P-functional,\" the stack layer architecture, and the theoretical basis) are missing or buried in footnotes.\n   - Typos, grammatical errors, and inconsistent terminology (e.g., \"bottleneacks\") further hinder readability.\n   - The method’s third pruning step (weighted k-means clustering) lacks a rigorous derivation, and its equations are unclear or potentially flawed (e.g., undefined operations on vectors).\n\n3. **Novelty and Originality**:\n   - Key components of the method (e.g., removing \"dead\" neurons or combining always-active neurons) are not novel and have been explored in prior work.\n   - The proposed \"stack network\" architecture is noted to resemble existing techniques like highway networks, raising questions about originality.\n   - The reliance on an *unpublished* work for foundational theory undermines credibility and makes validation impossible.\n\n4. **Theoretical Gaps**:\n   - Critical claims (e.g., equivalence between Equations 1 and 2, or the sufficiency of Carathéodory’s theorem) are not properly justified or referenced.\n   - The theoretical framework is underdeveloped, with key steps (e.g., approximation methods in pruning) lacking justification for their validity or computational efficiency.\n\n5. **Motivation and Positioning**:\n   - The paper fails to clearly articulate how its approach differs from or improves upon existing pruning methods.\n   - The motivation for specific design choices (e.g., the bottleneck architecture) is unclear, and the experiments do not address these gaps.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile the paper introduces an interesting idea for neuron reduction in ReLU networks, its execution falls short of the rigorous standards required for a top-tier conference. The lack of compelling experiments, insufficient comparisons, unclear presentation, and reliance on unpublished work collectively weaken its contribution. The method’s novelty is also questionable given existing literature, and the theoretical underpinnings are not sufficiently developed or validated.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

      "response": "Okay, let's tackle this. The paper is about using Fourier convolutional networks for 3D snapshot microscopy. The main idea is that existing methods like UNets can't handle the non-local optical encodings needed here, so they propose a Fourier-based approach which does better in their experiments. \n\nLooking at the reviewers' comments, there's a mix of positive and critical points. Reviewers 1, 2, 3, and 4 have given improved ratings (like 6), but some have reservations. Reviewer 3 mentions that the main ML ideas were already in Rippel et al., so the novelty is limited. They think it's more of an application paper, maybe better suited for a specialized conference. \n\nReviewer 4 points out that the technical novelty is marginal because Rippel's work did similar things. They also want more details on implementation and comparisons. The authors addressed some points but maybe not all. \n\nReviewer 5 is more critical, saying the evaluation is insufficient (only simulated data, one type of volume), and the UNet results are too bad without clear explanation. They also noticed inconsistencies in Table 3's timings. Their conclusion was a weak reject. \n\nReviewer 6 likes the idea but is concerned about real-world applicability and the necessity of 10^6 pixels. They think it's acceptable but needs more discussion on domain gaps. \n\nReviewer 7 thinks the method isn't super novel in ML terms but the application is solid. They mention the Fourier idea isn't new but the pipeline is well-executed. \n\nThe key issues here are: \n1. Technical novelty: The main contribution (Fourier networks for this problem) isn't entirely new, as Rippel's work is similar. The authors might be building on that but adding the application to 3D microscopy. \n2. Evaluation: Some reviewers want real data, more experiments, and clearer comparisons. The lensless imaging part is seen as a bit off-topic for the main title. \n3. Clarity and details: Some implementation details (like handling real-valued outputs, parameter counts) were missing, though the authors addressed some in rebuttals. \n\nTop-tier conferences like ICLR usually require significant technical contributions. Since the ML ideas here are incremental over Rippel, but the application is strong and the experiments show improvement, it's a bit of a toss-up. The reviewers' scores are mostly in the accept range (6 is marginally above threshold), except Reviewer 5's weak reject. \n\nHowever, the technical novelty is a problem. If the main ML ideas are not new, but the application is novel and impactful, maybe it's still acceptable. The authors did show better performance in their specific domain, which is important. The reviewers who pushed for acceptance (like Reviewer 3 after rebuttal) think it's a good application paper. \n\nThe lack of real data is a concern, but Reviewer 1 acknowledged that's hard and the simulations are okay. The typos and minor issues can be fixed in the camera-ready. \n\nFinal call: The paper has solid empirical results in a specific application, addresses a real problem in microscopy, and the method is better than existing approaches. Even if the ML technique isn't groundbreaking, the application's significance might tip it towards acceptance, especially since some top reviewers are on the fence but leaning accept. The main competition is whether the venue (ICLR) is appropriate. Reviewer 3 suggested a more application-focused venue, but if the AC thinks the application is of interest to ICLR's audience, then accept. Since the reviewers' scores after rebuttal are mostly 6, which is accept, I think it should go through.\n</think>\n\nThe paper proposes a Fourier convolutional network architecture to address the challenges of 3D snapshot microscopy, where existing UNet-based methods struggle with non-local optical encodings. The authors demonstrate improved performance over state-of-the-art methods in simulations and a lensless imaging dataset. However, several critical points emerge from the reviews:\n\n### Key Strengths:\n1. **Technical Execution**: The paper is well-written, with thorough experiments and a clear limitations section. The proposed method shows empirical superiority in handling global PSFs, a critical challenge in 3D microscopy.\n2. **Application Relevance**: The problem addressed (3D snapshot microscopy) is impactful for biological imaging, and the lensless imaging results further validate the method’s versatility.\n3. **Rebuttal Responses**: Authors addressed concerns about implementation details (e.g., conjugate symmetry in Fourier transforms) and clarified comparisons, improving reviewer confidence.\n\n### Key Weaknesses:\n1. **Technical Novelty**: Reviewers highlight that core ideas (e.g., Fourier-based convolutions) were previously explored in Rippel et al. (2015). The paper’s contributions are incremental in ML methodology but applied to a novel domain.\n2. **Evaluation Limitations**: \n   - Simulated data dominates, with no real-world experiments for 3D microscopy. While reviewers acknowledge the difficulty of obtaining real data, this limits validation of practical utility.\n   - The lensless imaging experiment, while illustrative, is tangential to the paper’s title and lacks direct relevance to 3D snapshot microscopy.\n   - Inconsistent explanations for UNet’s poor performance and timing discrepancies in Table 3 weaken credibility.\n3. **Venue Appropriateness**: Reviewer 3 argues that the work’s ML contributions are insufficient for ICLR, suggesting a more application-focused venue instead.\n\n### Balancing Factors:\n- **Impact vs. Novelty**: While the ML ideas are not groundbreaking, the application to 3D microscopy is compelling and addresses a specific, challenging problem. The method’s efficiency and performance gains are meaningful for the field.\n- **Reviewer Consensus**: Most reviewers (1, 2, 3, 4, 7) rate the paper as marginally acceptable (6/10), with only Reviewer 5 advocating rejection. The rebuttal improved several concerns, particularly around implementation and comparisons.\n- **Practical Significance**: The ability to optimize optical encoders with 10^6 parameters (via parallel simulation) is a notable contribution to computational imaging, even if incremental.\n\n### Final Decision:\nThe paper’s strong empirical results, clear problem framing, and relevance to computational imaging outweigh its incremental technical contributions. While the ML ideas are not novel, the application-specific advancements and thorough evaluation meet the bar for a top-tier conference like ICLR, especially given the reviewers’ post-rebuttal support. The lack of real-world data is a drawback but not fatal, as simulations are standard in this domain.\n\nFinal Decision: Accept"

The authors argue that both the architecture and GD contribute to generalization. They developed new tools to analyze NNGP's average test error and found that GD can further improve by selecting functions with larger margins. \n\nLooking at the reviewers' comments, there's a mix of positive and critical points. Reviewer 1 says the experiments show loose bounds and suggests focusing on NNGP's implicit bias. Reviewer 2 mentions presentation issues and the need for more comparisons with other architectures. Reviewer 3 thinks it's premature, especially since it doesn't apply to CNNs. Reviewer 4 points out unclear empirical evaluation and margin claims. Reviewer 5 is concerned about the margin claims not being rigorous with squared loss. Reviewer 6 says the GD analysis is limited and the paper overpromises. Reviewer 7 thinks the experiments are too specific to Nero optimizer and need more ablations. Reviewer 8 says the PAC-Bayes bound is incremental and the GD analysis isn't novel. Reviewer 9 wants more architecture comparisons and questions the dataset choice.\n\nThe main strengths are the theoretical contributions on NNGP error bounds and the exploration of architecture vs. GD's role. But the weaknesses are significant: the bounds aren't tight, experiments are limited (e.g., using Nero instead of standard optimizers, not testing CNNs), and the margin claims aren't well-supported for GD with squared loss. Multiple reviewers mention the lack of comparison to prior work and the narrow experimental setup. The paper's claims about GD's implicit bias in margin maximization face criticism for being either not applicable to their setup or not rigorously proven.\n\nThe authors might need to address these points by expanding experiments, clarifying their GD analysis, and better situating their work within existing literature. However, as it stands, the consensus among reviewers seems to lean towards the paper being borderline but needing more work. Since top-tier conferences require strong contributions and thorough validation, the current submission's incremental nature and unresolved issues might make it a reject.

While the work presents novel technical contributions, such as PAC-Bayes bounds and an estimator for NNGP error, several critical issues undermine its readiness for a top-tier conference:\n\n### Key Strengths:\n1. **Theoretical Contributions**: The development of analytical bounds and a consistent estimator for NNGP test error is a non-trivial contribution, particularly for understanding architectural bias.\n2. **Conceptual Insight**: The paper highlights the nuanced interplay between architecture and optimization, a topic of significant interest in deep learning theory.\n3. **Empirical Findings**: The experiments showing a gap between NNGP performance and GD-trained networks (e.g., using the Nero optimizer) are thought-provoking and suggest a role for GD’s implicit bias.\n\n### Major Weaknesses:\n1. **Loose Bounds and Limited Practical Significance**: Multiple reviewers (1, 6, 7, 9) note that the PAC-Bayes bounds are not tight and do not align with empirical performance, weakening their practical relevance. The authors do not adequately address why these gaps exist or how the bounds could be improved.\n2. **Ambiguous Claims About GD’s Implicit Bias**:\n   - The margin-based argument for GD’s role is criticized as underdeveloped (Reviewers 1, 2, 4, 5, 8). Specifically, the paper conflates margin maximization with GD’s behavior under squared loss, which lacks theoretical grounding (Reviewer 5). The use of the Nero optimizer (instead of standard methods like SGD) complicates generalizability (Reviewer 7).\n   - The distinction between GD’s implicit bias and overfitting is unclear (Reviewer 2), and the analysis does not clearly separate architectural bias from optimization dynamics (Reviewers 2, 6, 7).\n3. **Narrow Experimental Scope**:\n   - Experiments focus on MLPs and the Nero optimizer, limiting broader applicability (Reviewers 2, 3, 7, 9). Comparisons to prior work (e.g., Valle-Pérez et al.) and other architectures (e.g., CNNs) are missing or insufficient.\n   - The dataset used (likely synthetic or small) raises questions about the bounds’ relevance to real-world tasks (Reviewer 9).\n4. **Presentation and Clarity**:\n   - The paper overstates its contributions, particularly regarding GD’s margin-seeking behavior, which lacks rigorous support (Reviewers 5, 6, 7).\n   - The discussion of margin and its relation to NTK/CNN performance is inconsistent with prior literature (Reviewers 2, 8).\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile the paper raises important questions and offers some novel theoretical tools, its empirical validation is insufficient, its claims about GD’s implicit bias are under-supported, and its experimental scope is too narrow. The reviewers’ consensus leans toward the work being borderline but ultimately premature for a top-tier conference. Key issues—such as addressing the Nero dependency, expanding architecture comparisons, and rigorously grounding margin claims—would require substantial revisions beyond the current submission.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

Reviewer 2 and 4 point out theoretical gaps. The method minimizes KID/FID instead of ELBO, which raises questions about what distribution the samples actually represent. There's a lack of proof that the model's expressive power isn't compromised. Also, the use of perceptual metrics might lead to overfitting those metrics rather than improving the model's true quality.

While Theorem 1 partially addresses this, a full proof of expressiveness or guarantees is lacking.  \n2. **Empirical Limitations**: Results on high-resolution datasets (e.g., LSUN 256x256) are missing, and ImageNet 64 samples are less compelling than CIFAR-10, hinting at dataset-dependent performance.  \n3. **Clarity Issues**: Some notation (e.g., double subscripts in equations) and implementation details (e.g., parameter ranges) require clarification.  \n\nPost-rebuttal updates improved clarity and addressed some theoretical concerns (e.g., Theorem 1). While weaknesses persist, the empirical contributions and problem significance outweigh these limitations for a top-tier conference.

Let me start by going through all the information provided.\n\nThe paper is about the Feedback Alignment (FA) algorithm in deep linear networks. The main contributions are theoretical: they analyze convergence, provide rates for both continuous and discrete dynamics, and discuss implicit regularization and anti-regularization based on initializations. The abstract mentions that certain initializations lead to learning smaller components before larger ones (anti-regularization), which is interesting. They also propose initialization schemes that help with learning in order of importance.\n\nLooking at the reviewer comments, there's a mix of positive and critical points. Let's break down each reviewer's feedback.\n\nReviewer 1 points out that the analysis relies on diagonalizable matrices, reducing the problem to one-dimensional dynamics. They're concerned this oversimplifies the problem, especially for deeper networks (L>2) where convergence is only shown for special initializations. They also question if the implicit anti-regularization is just a math artifact under specific initializations and not observed in common setups. The reviewer thinks the one-dimensional analysis might not bridge the gap between FA and GD's performance, so the novelty might be low.\n\nReviewer 2 agrees with the convergence results but notes strong assumptions like diagonalizability and specific initializations. They mention the lack of exploration into how FA aligns weights with feedback matrices, and the focus on linear networks without non-linear activations. The loss function assumes infinite samples, which is a strong condition. Also, the initialization dependency between layers is artificial. Still, they acknowledge the anti-regularization as interesting but the conditions limit significance.\n\nReviewer 3 is more positive. They see the implicit bias (anti-regularization) as novel and important, especially since it's sensitive to initialization in a way GD isn't. The experiments align well with theory even when relaxing assumptions. They recommend acceptance, noting the timeliness of FA research and contributions to understanding implicit biases. However, they have some minor questions about the discrete dynamics and the conclusion's claims about non-linear networks.\n\nReviewer 4 also has concerns about the restrictive spectral initialization. They argue that such initialization isn't used in practice, so the results might not generalize. They want more experiments under non-spectral setups and better visualization of scalar dynamics. Still, they acknowledge the clear writing and interesting observations but lean towards a weak reject due to significance and practical relevance issues.\n\nNow, considering the conference standards. Top-tier conferences like ICLR or NeurIPS require strong theoretical contributions, clear significance, and ideally some practical relevance or novel insights. The paper's theoretical analysis is solid (all reviewers agree on correctness), and the implicit anti-regularization is a novel finding. However, the limitations are significant:\n\n1. **Assumptions**: The diagonalizability and spectral initialization are restrictive. These might not hold in real-world scenarios where networks are non-linear and initialized randomly. The authors don't provide evidence that their findings extend beyond these assumptions, which limits the practical impact.\n\n2. **Scope**: The focus on linear networks is a common approach for theoretical analysis, but FA's real-world applications are in non-linear networks. The reviewers point out that the analysis doesn't address how FA's behavior translates there, making the results less impactful for the broader community.\n\n3. **Novelty**: While the implicit anti-regularization is novel, the technical approach (reducing to scalar dynamics via diagonalization) might be seen as an extension of existing linear network analysis (like Saxe et al. 2014). Reviewers 1 and 2 rate technical significance as low to moderate, while Reviewer 3 gives a higher score but is a single voice.\n\n4. **Empirical Work**: The experiments are limited to linear networks and specific initializations. Without showing that the phenomena occur under more realistic settings, the empirical significance is weak.\n\nOn the positive side, the paper is well-written, the math is correct, and the implicit anti-regularization is an interesting theoretical contribution. However, the restrictive assumptions and lack of broader applicability might make it less compelling for a top conference. The reviewers' mixed scores on significance and novelty are critical here. Two reviewers (1 and 4) are more critical, while Reviewer 3 is positive but in a minority. Reviewer 2 is somewhat in the middle but points out key limitations.\n\nTop conferences often require that the work not only be correct but also make a substantial contribution. The paper's theoretical insights are there, but the narrow scope and assumptions might not meet the \"significant\" bar. The authors could address some concerns with experiments under different initializations or better connections to non-linear cases, but as it stands, the limitations are too substantial.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject\n</think>\n\nThe paper provides a theoretical analysis of the Feedback Alignment (FA) algorithm for deep linear networks, focusing on convergence guarantees and implicit regularization/anti-regularization phenomena. While the technical contributions are correct and the implicit anti-regularization is an interesting theoretical observation, several critical limitations undermine its significance for a top-tier conference:\n\n1. **Restrictive Assumptions**: The analysis relies heavily on diagonalizability of matrices and specific spectral initializations, which are not representative of practical scenarios. These assumptions simplify the problem to one-dimensional dynamics, potentially oversimplifying the behavior of FA in real-world settings. Reviewers highlight that such initializations are rarely used in practice, limiting the relevance of the results.\n\n2. **Scope Limitations**: The focus on linear networks and the absence of non-linear analysis mean the work does not address FA's empirical success in non-linear architectures. While linear networks are a common theoretical tool, the lack of exploration into how FA's properties extend to non-linear cases reduces the paper's broader impact.\n\n3. **Empirical Weakness**: The experiments are limited to linear networks and specific initializations. Without evidence that the observed phenomena (e.g., anti-regularization) occur under more realistic conditions (e.g., random initialization), the empirical significance is marginal.\n\n4. **Novelty Concerns**: While the implicit anti-regularization is novel, the technical approach (reducing dynamics to scalar systems via diagonalization) is seen as an extension of prior linear network analyses. Most reviewers rated technical significance as low to moderate, with only one reviewer strongly advocating for its novelty.\n\nDespite the paper's clear writing and correct mathematics, the restrictive assumptions and narrow scope prevent it from making a sufficiently impactful contribution to warrant acceptance at a top-tier conference. The theoretical insights are interesting but insufficient to bridge the gap between FA's empirical success and the analyzed settings.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

      "response": "Okay, let's tackle this. The paper is about adversarial examples from a frequency perspective. The main claims are that adversarial examples aren't strictly high or low frequency but dataset-dependent, and they analyze how frequency affects adversarial training.\n\nLooking at the reviewers, there's a mix of opinions. Reviewer 1 wants them to consider UAPs, which the paper might not have addressed. Reviewer 2 is concerned about the clarity of contributions and whether their methods actually improve performance. They also question the difference from existing work like TRADES. Reviewer 3 points out that the motivation isn't new since prior works already challenged the high-frequency idea. They also mention the dataset limitation (only CIFAR and ImageNet) and lack of other attacks. Reviewer 4 is positive, saying it's interesting and should be accepted with minor fixes. Reviewer 5 is confused about the contributions and thinks it's not novel enough. Reviewer 6 is mostly positive but wants more experiments on different datasets and architectures.\n\nThe key issues here are novelty and contribution clarity. The paper's main point—that adversarial examples are dataset-dependent—isn't entirely new, as several cited papers already made similar points. The experiments are on limited datasets and attack methods. The methods proposed (frequency-based adversarial training) don't seem to show significant performance gains over existing techniques, which is a problem for a top-tier conference. Also, the writing could be clearer, especially in the contributions section.\n\nOn the positive side, the experiments are extensive, and the findings do add to the understanding of frequency roles in adversarial robustness. However, the lack of clear technical novelty and the overlap with concurrent work (like Bernhard et al. 2021) weaken its case. The reviewers who want acceptance note the insights but acknowledge existing limitations. Since top conferences require significant contributions, and this paper's main points are incremental, it might not meet the bar. The authors need to better differentiate their work and demonstrate more impactful results.\n</think>\n\nThe paper presents an analysis of adversarial examples through a frequency-based lens, challenging the notion that adversarial perturbations are strictly high-frequency. It claims that adversarial examples are dataset-dependent and provides insights into adversarial training via frequency constraints. However, the paper faces several critical issues that undermine its suitability for a top-tier conference:\n\n### Key Strengths:\n1. **Empirical Insights**: The paper offers interesting experimental results, such as the dataset-dependent nature of adversarial perturbations and the analysis of frequency components in models trained on CIFAR-10 vs. ImageNet. These findings contribute to the ongoing debate about adversarial robustness.\n2. **Technical Depth**: The use of frequency analysis (e.g., DCT) and the proposed noise gradient metric provide novel angles for studying adversarial examples, even if not entirely groundbreaking.\n3. **Extensive Experiments**: The authors conduct thorough experiments, including analyses on ImageNet-scale datasets, which adds credibility to their claims.\n\n### Major Weaknesses:\n1. **Lack of Novelty**:\n   - The core claim that adversarial examples are *not strictly high-frequency* and *dataset-dependent* has been addressed in prior work (e.g., Tsuzuku et al., 2019; Yin et al., 2020; Bernhard et al., 2021). The paper adds incremental evidence but does not fundamentally shift the consensus.\n   - The concurrent work by Bernhard et al. (2021) overlaps significantly, weakening the paper’s uniqueness. The authors fail to clearly differentiate their contributions from this work.\n\n2. **Underdeveloped Contributions**:\n   - The proposed methods (e.g., frequency-constrained adversarial training) lack clear performance improvements over existing techniques. Reviewer 2 notes that the methods do not outperform baselines, and the \"trade-off control\" via frequency is not distinct from existing hyperparameters like TRADES’ λ.\n   - The paper’s contributions are buried in lengthy related work sections, making it difficult to discern its unique value. The authors do not sufficiently highlight how their framework advances the field beyond prior art.\n\n3. **Methodological Limitations**:\n   - **Dataset Scope**: The analysis is limited to CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-derived datasets. Including simpler datasets (e.g., MNIST) or diverse modalities (e.g., non-natural images) would strengthen the generality of claims.\n   - **Attack Diversity**: Only PGD attacks are studied. Testing against other attacks (e.g., C&W, AutoAttack) is necessary to validate the robustness of conclusions.\n   - **Technical Gaps**: Questions remain about imperceptibility in low-frequency attacks, the justification for averaging noise gradients across classes, and the practical implementation of frequency-constrained adversarial training (e.g., defining frequency subspaces).\n\n4. **Clarity and Presentation**:\n   - The paper’s writing is criticized for burying contributions in lengthy related work sections. The abstract and introduction fail to clearly state the paper’s unique insights.\n   - Figures are presented out of order, disrupting the narrative flow.\n\n### Reviewer Consensus:\n- **Pro-Acceptance View**: Reviewers 4 and 6 highlight the paper’s empirical contributions and practical insights for adversarial training. They acknowledge its value to the community but note minor presentation issues.\n- **Pro-Rejection/Reservation**: Reviewers 1, 2, 3, and 5 emphasize the lack of novelty, insufficient methodological rigor, and unclear technical contributions. Reviewer 3 and 5 explicitly recommend rejection or major revisions.\n\n### Final Assessment:\nWhile the paper provides valuable empirical observations and engages with important questions in adversarial robustness, its contributions are incremental relative to existing work. The overlap with concurrent research, lack of clear performance gains, and methodological limitations (e.g., dataset scope, attack diversity) prevent it from meeting the high bar for a top-tier conference. The authors have not sufficiently distinguished their work from prior art, and the technical novelty is marginal. Addressing these issues would require substantial revisions beyond what is feasible for a conference rebuttal.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

      "correct": true,
      "response": "Okay, let's tackle this. I need to decide whether this paper should be accepted or rejected for a top-tier conference. Let me start by going through all the provided information carefully.\n\nFirst, the paper's title and abstract suggest that it's about showing that training two-layer ReLU networks with regularization can be transformed into a convex optimization problem with cone constraints. The key contributions include characterizing all global optima via this convex program, showing no spurious valleys when the hidden layer is sufficiently large, and providing algorithms for checking optimality and constructing paths to minima. The keywords are neural networks, convex optimization, etc.\n\nLooking at the reviewer comments, there are four reviewers. Let's go through each one.\n\nReviewer 1 gives a mixed review. They acknowledge the contributions as novel extensions of Pilanci and Ergen 2020, which is good. The weaknesses they mention are the single-hidden layer limitation and some typos. The correctness is rated 3 (some claims have minor issues) and technical novelty is 3 (significant but some prior work exists). The reviewer also points out specific typos and inconsistencies in equations and definitions, which need to be addressed.\n\nReviewer 2 is very positive. They call it the best among submissions, highlight the novel connections between non-convex loss and convex optimization, and recommend acceptance. They do ask about extending to other activations and deeper networks, and mention missing references. Correctness is 4 (all claims correct), but technical novelty is 3 again. The empirical significance is also 3, but since it's a theoretical paper, maybe that's okay.\n\nReviewer 3 is also positive but points out that some prior work by Pilanci et al. is similar, so the novelty might be incremental. They suggest experiments and extensions to deeper networks. They found some typos and unclear parts, like the positive homogeneity point. Correctness is 3, technical novelty 3. After rebuttal, they were satisfied with the responses.\n\nReviewer 4 is very positive, calling it a \"clear accept\". They highlight the complete characterization of global minima via convex programs, and the extensions over prior work. They note the lack of bias terms but think it's manageable. Correctness is 4, technical novelty 4 here, which is higher than others. The only downside is it's limited to two layers.\n\nSo, the main points for acceptance are the novel theoretical contributions, extending prior work, and the clear significance in understanding the optimization landscape. The weaknesses are the single-layer limitation, some typos, and the question of how much is new compared to Pilanci/Ergen. However, reviewers 2 and 4 are strong proponents, with 4 even giving a 4/4 on technical novelty. The others have minor issues but still see the value.\n\nThe paper's main contributions seem solid. The fact that they can characterize all global optima exactly via convex programs is a big deal. The polynomial-time algorithm for checking optimality and the path construction are also strong. The spurious valleys result is important for understanding why optimization works well here.\n\nThe limitations (single layer, ReLU only) are noted, but top conferences often accept papers that are deep in their scope even if not fully general. The reviewers' consensus seems to lean towards acceptance, especially since two reviewers (2 and 4) are very positive, and others have minor concerns addressed in rebuttal.\n\nThe typos and technical issues can be fixed in the camera-ready version. The theoretical contributions are significant enough for a top conference, even if some aspects build on prior work. The fact that Reviewer 4 gave a 4 on technical novelty suggests that the work is sufficiently novel beyond Pilanci/Ergen, which is a key point.\n\nTherefore, despite the noted limitations and minor issues, the paper's theoretical advancements and clear significance in the field make it a strong candidate for acceptance.\n</think>\n\nThe paper presents a significant theoretical contribution by establishing an exact characterization of global optima for regularized two-layer ReLU networks through a convex optimization framework. The key strengths include:\n\n1. **Novel Extensions and Completeness**: The work extends Pilanci & Ergen (2020) by characterizing *all* global optima via a convex program, not just constructing one solution. This provides a complete framework for understanding the optimization landscape, including invariant transformations, polynomial-time optimality checks, and path constructions to global minima. These contributions are novel and advance the field beyond prior work.\n\n2. **Theoretical Depth**: The analysis avoids duality-based approaches, offering a fresh perspective. The proof that no spurious valleys exist for sufficiently large hidden layers (up to 2*(n+1)) is impactful, as it explains why gradient-based methods succeed in practice for such networks. The connection between Clarke stationary points and subsampled convex problems adds practical insights.\n\n3. **Significance**: The framework provides tools for analyzing neural network training landscapes, which is a central challenge in deep learning theory. The polynomial-time algorithm for verifying global optimality and the explicit path construction are concrete, actionable results with potential applications in optimization and verification.\n\n**Weaknesses and Limitations**:\n- The analysis is restricted to two-layer ReLU networks, which limits immediate applicability to deeper architectures. However, this is a common starting point for theoretical work, and the reviewers acknowledge its value as a foundation for future extensions.\n- Some typos and technical inconsistencies (e.g., equation mismatches, undefined terms) were noted but are minor and fixable.\n- While prior work by Pilanci et al. exists, the reviewers (especially Reviewer 4) emphasize that this paper’s contributions—such as characterizing *all* optima and providing novel algorithms—are sufficiently novel and non-trivial extensions.\n\n**Reviewer Consensus**:\n- Reviewers 2 and 4 strongly advocate for acceptance, with Reviewer 4 explicitly calling it a \"clear accept\" and highlighting its significance. Reviewers 1 and 3 raise valid concerns (e.g., incremental novelty, lack of experiments) but ultimately support acceptance after addressing minor issues. The rebuttal addressed these concerns, and the remaining critiques are either fixable or secondary to the theoretical contributions.\n\n**Conclusion**: The paper’s theoretical advancements, completeness, and potential impact on understanding neural network optimization landscapes outweigh its limitations. While extensions to deeper networks or other activations would strengthen future work, the current contributions are substantial and meet the standards of a top-tier conference.\n\nFinal Decision: Accept"

Let me start by going through all the information provided.\n\nFirst, the paper's title is \"Target Propagation via Regularized Inversion.\" The abstract mentions that they're revisiting Target Propagation (TP) as a method alternative to backpropagation (BP), focusing on a simple version using regularized inversion of layers. They compare computational complexity with BP and show applications in training RNNs with long sequences. The experiments highlight the importance of regularization in TP.\n\nNow, looking at the reviewer comments. There are four reviewers, each with their own points. Let me go through each one.\n\nReviewer 1 is not very enthusiastic. They point out that the proposed TP method requires weight transport, which limits its interest compared to other TP variants that don't. They also mention that the algorithm is more computationally expensive than BP, especially in terms of not allowing decoupled updates or being suitable for distributed settings. The experiments aren't convincing enough, and there are no theoretical guarantees that the descent directions are better than gradients. They have several specific questions about the methodology, like the 0th-order approximation claim, handling multiple minimizers with ReLU, and the vanishing/exploding gradients issue. They also question the citation of LeCun's work. Their summary says the algorithm loses features that make TP attractive and lacks strong guarantees, giving technical and empirical novelty low scores (2/4).\n\nReviewer 2 thinks the approach is novel and has a natural interpretation via autograd and linearized inversion. They note that the cost of inversion can be amortized over sequence length and there's a theoretical guarantee (though they mention the guarantee is a bound between TP and BP). However, they point out that the experiments show large variations in training loss and accuracy compared to BP, which might indicate issues with theoretical analysis. They also note a typo. Their summary is more positive but still gives technical novelty a 2 and empirical a 3. They think the algorithm is tractable but the results are a bit confusing.\n\nReviewer 3 mentions the paper is clear and the experiments are illustrative but criticizes the experimental section. The accuracy on CIFAR-10 is very low (under 20%), which is concerning. They suggest that maybe the baselines or the model setup isn't competitive. Also, the paper claims the method works for general neural networks, but experiments are only on RNNs. They think the experiments don't fully show superiority over BP and lean towards rejection but are open to feedback.\n\nReviewer 4 finds the paper easy to read and the algorithm straightforward but points out weaknesses in theory and experiments. The theoretical analysis is considered too shallow, especially the lemma comparing TP and BP directions. The relationship to Gauss-Newton isn't fully explored. Empirically, there are too few experiments and comparisons with other RNN optimization methods like Hessian-Free. They think the improvements over GD aren't well-explained and more comparisons are needed. Their summary says the method is interesting but needs better theory and experiments. They give technical novelty a 3 and empirical a 2.\n\nSo, compiling all this:\n\nStrengths:\n- The method is implementable via autograd, which is a practical advantage.\n- Some theoretical grounding, like the bound between TP and BP directions.\n- The approach addresses inversion with regularization, which is a novel angle.\n- The paper is well-written and clear.\n\nWeaknesses:\n- The algorithm requires weight transport, which is a drawback compared to other TP variants.\n- Higher computational cost than BP, especially in certain settings.\n- Experiments are limited in scope and competitiveness (low accuracy on CIFAR-10, only RNNs tested).\n- Theoretical analysis is not thorough enough; key questions from reviewers remain unanswered (like the 0th vs 1st order approximation, handling ReLU, Gauss-Newton relationship).\n- Lack of comparison with existing methods beyond BP, such as Hessian-Free or other RNN optimization techniques.\n- The empirical results don't convincingly show superiority over BP, with some reviewers noting high variance and underwhelming performance.\n\nThe main issues seem to be the lack of strong empirical validation and theoretical depth. While the method is novel in its approach to inversion and regularization, the experiments don't demonstrate clear advantages over BP in practical scenarios. The computational cost is higher, and the method's limitations (weight transport, dependency on regularization) aren't sufficiently addressed. The reviewers' concerns about the theoretical underpinnings and the need for more rigorous analysis and experiments are significant.\n\nTop-tier conferences usually require strong contributions in either theory, methodology, or empirical results. Here, the technical novelty is marginal (scores of 2 or 3 from reviewers), and the empirical results aren't compelling enough. The paper might be a borderline case, but given the consensus among reviewers (especially the first three leaning towards rejection or needing more work), it's likely that the paper doesn't meet the high standards required. The authors need to address the theoretical gaps, provide more comprehensive experiments, and demonstrate clear advantages over existing methods to be accepted.\n</think>\n\nThe paper proposes a variant of Target Propagation (TP) using regularized inversion of neural network layers, aiming to address computational and theoretical challenges in training recurrent neural networks (RNNs). While the approach is presented as a practical implementation within differentiable programming frameworks, the reviewers' critiques highlight critical shortcomings that undermine its competitiveness and novelty for a top-tier conference.\n\n### Key Strengths:\n1. **Implementability and Interpretability**: The method leverages autograd systems and provides a natural interpretation via linearized inversion, aligning with modern computational tools.\n2. **Partial Theoretical Grounding**: A theoretical bound comparing TP and backpropagation (BP) directions is provided, and the relationship to Gauss-Newton methods is noted, though underdeveloped.\n3. **Clarity and Structure**: The paper is well-written and organized, making its contributions accessible.\n\n### Major Weaknesses:\n1. **Lack of Competitive Advantages**:\n   - **Computational Cost**: The algorithm is strictly more expensive than BP, especially in non-sequence settings, and lacks decoupled updates or distributed optimization compatibility.\n   - **Empirical Performance**: Experiments show subpar results (e.g., <20% accuracy on CIFAR-10) and high variance compared to BP, with limited evidence of superiority. The focus on RNNs without broader network comparisons (e.g., CNNs) weakens generalizability.\n2. **Theoretical Gaps**:\n   - **Unanswered Questions**: Key issues raised by reviewers remain unresolved, such as the 0th-order approximation claim, handling of ReLU activations, and the relationship to Gauss-Newton methods.\n   - **No Convergence Guarantees**: Unlike methods like feedback alignment, the paper lacks formal convergence analysis or theoretical justification for improved optimization.\n3. **Methodological Limitations**:\n   - **Weight Transport Requirement**: The proposed TP variant reintroduces weight transport, a drawback compared to other TP approaches that avoid it, diminishing its appeal for neuromorphic or distributed systems.\n   - **Regularization Dependency**: The method’s reliance on regularization raises concerns about robustness and practicality, particularly in scenarios where regularization is challenging.\n4. **Incomplete Experimental Evaluation**:\n   - **Limited Baselines**: The paper does not compare against state-of-the-art RNN optimization methods (e.g., Hessian-Free optimization) or modern RNN architectures, making it difficult to assess its relevance.\n   - **Underwhelming Results**: The experiments fail to demonstrate consistent or compelling improvements over BP, even in sequence modeling tasks.\n\n### Reviewer Consensus:\n- **Technical Novelty**: Most reviewers (1, 3, 4) rate technical novelty as marginal (scores of 2 or 3), noting that the contributions build on prior work without significant breakthroughs.\n- **Empirical Significance**: Empirical results are deemed insufficient to justify the method’s adoption, with reviewers (1, 3, 4) criticizing the lack of rigorous comparisons and underwhelming performance.\n- **Theoretical Rigor**: The paper’s theoretical analysis is incomplete, with reviewers (1, 4) emphasizing the need for deeper exploration of relationships to existing methods (e.g., Gauss-Newton) and convergence guarantees.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile the paper introduces a novel implementation of TP with regularization, its limitations in computational efficiency, empirical validation, and theoretical depth outweigh its contributions. The method does not yet demonstrate the robustness, scalability, or clear advantages over BP required for acceptance at a top-tier conference. The reviewers’ critiques—particularly regarding underwhelming experiments, unresolved theoretical questions, and lack of competitive baselines—highlight that the work is not yet mature enough for publication at this level.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

      "response": "Okay, let's tackle this. The paper is about using a weighted mean trick to optimize higher-order moments of the loss distribution, aiming for better robustness. The reviewers have mixed opinions. Let me go through each point.\n\nFirst, the title and abstract mention that minimizing the weighted mean optimizes variance, skewness, etc., which tightens bounds on the loss mean. The experiments compare it to other robust loss functions but with a theoretical angle. \n\nLooking at the reviewer comments:\n\nReviewer 1 is concerned about how the λ parameters are chosen. They argue that the empirical improvement might just be due to tuning, especially since allowing both positive and negative λ can have opposite effects. They suggest focusing on negative weights and separating variance penalization. That's a valid point because if the baseline is ERM (λ=0), then any tuned λ could show improvement, but that doesn't prove the method's validity. The authors need to address how λ is selected without overfitting to the data.\n\nReviewer 2 and 3 both point out a flaw in the algorithm. The proposed Algorithm 1 only uses the first term of the gradient, ignoring the second term from the chain rule. That means the algorithm isn't actually minimizing the stated objective function. This is a critical issue because the theoretical claims rely on optimizing that objective. If the algorithm isn't doing that, the experiments might not validate the theory. The authors need to fix the algorithm or clarify why the second term is omitted.\n\nReviewer 4 has several points. They note inconsistency in using negative λ, which complicates the interpretation. The paper's theoretical parts in Section 2 (convexity) don't apply to Section 3 where different weights are used, breaking coherence. Also, the weights depend on unknown expectations, which might require empirical estimates but the connection to true risk isn't clear. They also mention that the approach might not be novel compared to existing works like Trimmed Mean or MoM. The negative λ part seems conflicting with the initial motivation (variance penalization with positive λ). The reviewer thinks the theoretical contributions are basic and the paper's coherence is an issue.\n\nReviewer 5 is confused about the dependency of weights on θ. The theoretical results assume W doesn't depend on θ, but in reality, it does, which might invalidate convexity claims. They also note that the algorithm isn't clearly minimizing the intended objective. This undermines the theoretical foundation. The reviewer thinks the results are straightforward and the paper isn't ready for a top conference unless clarified.\n\nReviewer 6 points out unclear writing, like Lemma 2's wording and the meaning of \"convex objective ℓ\". They also question the robustness to heavy-tailed losses and whether the theorems hold when weights are clipped. These are technical issues that need fixing for clarity and correctness.\n\nReviewer 7 is more positive, seeing the idea as interesting and potentially useful, but notes the theorems are straightforward and could benefit from more applications. However, their positive take is tempered by others' criticisms.\n\nPutting this together: The main issues are the algorithm's validity (not minimizing the claimed objective), the handling of λ parameters (especially negative ones conflicting with initial motivation), lack of coherence between sections, and unclear theoretical grounding due to dependencies on θ. The reviewers pointing out these flaws (especially 2,3,4,5) are significant because they affect the core claims. The empirical results might not hold if the algorithm isn't correctly implemented. The theoretical contributions are seen as incremental or not novel enough, especially compared to existing robust methods. The writing and notation issues add to the confusion.\n\nEven though Reviewer 7 is positive, the majority of the reviews (especially from more critical reviewers) highlight fundamental flaws in the methodology and theoretical soundness. The paper needs substantial revisions to address the algorithm's gradient computation, clarify λ selection, ensure theoretical claims hold when dependencies on θ are considered, and better align with prior work. Since top conferences require strong theoretical and empirical contributions, and these issues haven't been resolved, the paper likely doesn't meet the standards.\n</think>\n\nThe paper proposes a weighted mean trick to optimize higher-order moments of the loss distribution for robustness. While the idea of linking weighted means to moment penalization is intriguing, several critical issues undermine its acceptance at a top-tier conference:\n\n1. **Algorithmic Validity**: Reviewers 2, 3, and 5 highlight a fundamental flaw in Algorithm 1. The proposed gradient update omits a key term from the chain rule, meaning it does not actually minimize the stated objective function \\( \\mathbb{E}[w(\\theta)\\ell(\\theta)] \\). This invalidates the theoretical claims and calls the empirical results into question. Without fixing this, the core contribution is unproven.\n\n2. **Theoretical Coherence**: Reviewers 4 and 5 note that the paper’s theoretical results (e.g., convexity guarantees in Section 2) rely on weights \\( W \\) that do not depend on \\( \\theta \\), but in reality, \\( W \\) explicitly depends on \\( \\theta \\). This breaks the theoretical foundations of convexity and penalization claims. Additionally, the paper inconsistently treats negative \\( \\lambda \\) values, conflicting with its initial motivation (variance penalization via positive \\( \\lambda \\)), and fails to justify their use rigorously.\n\n3. **Empirical and Methodological Concerns**: \n   - Reviewer 1 points out that empirical improvements may stem from hyperparameter tuning rather than the method’s validity, especially since allowing both positive and negative \\( \\lambda \\) can have opposing effects.\n   - Reviewer 4 questions the practicality of weights depending on unknown expectations and the lack of convergence guarantees for Algorithm 1.\n   - Reviewer 6 raises concerns about the robustness of the approach to heavy-tailed losses and the validity of theorems when weights are clipped.\n\n4. **Novelty and Prior Work**: Reviewers 4 and 5 note that the theoretical insights (e.g., variance penalization via weighted means) are basic and already addressed in prior work (e.g., Duchi & Namkoong, 2019; Trimmed Mean, MoM). The paper’s contributions are incremental and lack a clear distinction from existing robust optimization techniques.\n\n5. **Clarity and Presentation**: Multiple reviewers (4, 6, 7) criticize the paper’s notation inconsistencies, unclear explanations (e.g., Lemma 2’s wording), and poor writing, which hinder reproducibility and understanding.\n\n**Conclusion**: While the paper’s core idea has potential, the unresolved algorithmic flaws, theoretical inconsistencies, and lack of novelty relative to prior work render it insufficient for a top-tier conference. The empirical results are undermined by the algorithm’s failure to align with the stated objective, and the theoretical claims are weakened by dependencies on \\( \\theta \\) and conflicting motivations for \\( \\lambda \\). Without substantial revisions addressing these issues, the paper does not meet the standards of a leading venue.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

Correctness is 3, so some minor issues.\n\nReviewer 5 is more positive, noting the effectiveness on small faces and good ablation studies. However, they mention limited application to objects with varying scales. Correctness is 4, but technical novelty is 3 again. So, they think it's useful but not super novel.\n\nReviewer 6 is positive, highlighting strong results on WIDER FACE. They question the use of random search vs evolutionary methods and suggest comparing with NAS approaches. Despite that, they think it's acceptable. Their ratings are higher (technical and empirical novelty 4), but they still have concerns about methodology comparison.\n\nReviewer 7 mentions the lack of figures and algorithm details, and points out that cross-dataset comparisons are incomplete (e.g., not comparing with BFBox and HAMBox on other datasets). They also note that the search strategies are straightforward. Their technical novelty is 2, empirical 3, and correctness 3.\n\nSo, compiling the key points:\n\nStrengths:\n- Effective methods (CR and SR) with good ablation studies.\n- State-of-the-art results on WIDER FACE, especially for small faces.\n- Practical benefits (faster and better than competitors like TinaFace).\n- Clear motivation based on the dataset's scale distribution.\n\nWeaknesses:\n- The search strategy (CR) is seen as simple/random, not innovative.\n- Lack of comparison with other NAS methods (like evolutionary approaches), making it hard to attribute improvements to their contributions vs existing NAS.\n- Limited discussion on other datasets; some SOTA comparisons missing (e.g., BFBox on Pascal).\n- Methodological details (like the search space design, sample redistribution specifics) are not fully explained, leading to clarity issues.\n- Technical novelty is considered marginal by some reviewers (scores 2-3).\n\nTop-tier conferences usually require high novelty, strong methodology, and thorough evaluations. The paper's main contributions (CR and SR) are effective but might not be groundbreaking. The lack of comparison with other NAS methods is a significant gap because the search aspect is a key part of their approach. If their method's improvements are due to standard NAS techniques rather than their specific contributions, that weakens the paper's originality.\n\nHowever, the empirical results are strong, especially on the primary dataset. The problem addressed (efficient face detection for small faces) is important. The reviewers' mixed scores on novelty and the fact that some (like Reviewer 6) still recommend acceptance suggest it's a borderline case.\n\nBut top conferences often prioritize novelty and methodological innovation. Since the technical novelty is rated low by some and the methodology isn't thoroughly compared to existing NAS approaches, this might tip the decision. The paper could be improved with additional comparisons and better explanations, but as is, it might not meet the high bar for a top-tier venue.\n</think>\n\nThe paper proposes SCRFD, a method combining Computation Redistribution (CR) and Sample Redistribution (SR) to improve face detection efficiency and accuracy, particularly for small faces. While the empirical results on WIDER FACE are strong (state-of-the-art AP with lower computational cost), several critical issues emerge from the reviews:\n\n**Strengths:**\n1. **Empirical Impact:** The method achieves significant performance gains on small faces and outperforms competitors like TinaFace, demonstrating practical utility.\n2. **Clear Motivation:** The focus on the scale distribution of faces in WIDER FACE (78.93% <32×32 pixels) provides a compelling problem statement.\n3. **Ablation Studies:** The ablation results validate the effectiveness of both CR and SR, supporting the claims.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n1. **Technical Novelty:** Multiple reviewers (4, 7) note that the search strategies (e.g., random search for CR) are simplistic and lack innovation. The methodology’s reliance on straightforward techniques undermines its novelty, especially compared to prior NAS work.\n2. **Incomplete Comparisons:** Key comparisons with established NAS methods (e.g., evolutionary approaches) are missing, making it unclear whether improvements stem from the proposed methods or generic NAS. Additionally, cross-dataset comparisons (e.g., against BFBox/HAMBox on Pascal) are incomplete.\n3. **Methodological Clarity:** The search space design and SR implementation lack detail, and figures/algorithms are missing, hindering reproducibility and understanding.\n4. **Limited Scope:** Reviewer 5 notes the approach may have limited applicability beyond face detection with extreme scale variations.\n\n**Conclusion:** While the paper delivers strong empirical results and addresses an important problem, its technical contributions are incremental and insufficiently differentiated from prior NAS work. The lack of rigorous comparisons with relevant baselines and methodological gaps weaken its case for a top-tier conference, which demands higher novelty and methodological rigor. The reviewers’ mixed ratings on novelty (scores of 2–3) and unresolved concerns about attribution of improvements further justify a cautious rejection.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

      "response": "Okay, let's tackle this. I need to decide whether to accept or reject this paper for a top-tier conference. Let me start by going through all the information provided.\n\nThe paper is about TimeVAE, a VAE for generating multivariate time series. The key claims are interpretability, incorporating domain knowledge, and faster training compared to GANs. The reviewers have given their feedback, so I should look at their points.\n\nFirst, looking at the abstract and title, the authors are positioning this against GANs, which have been popular in time series generation. They mention their VAE approach's advantages. But the reviewers have several concerns.\n\nReviewer 1 points out that the decoder's new hyperparameters aren't well-explained, and there's no ablation study on interpretability. Also, the results in Table 1 where full training data leads to worse performance is confusing. They also ask about GP-VAE and the t-SNE plots. The reviewer thinks the paper isn't ready because of these issues.\n\nReviewer 2 says the model isn't novel enough. They argue that it's just a standard VAE applied to time series with convolutions instead of recurrent layers, and there's no significant innovation over existing methods like TimeGAN. The empirical evaluation is okay but not enough, and the technical novelty is low.\n\nReviewer 3 mentions that the paper lacks literature context, especially regarding state-space models and other generative approaches. The experiments use new datasets not available elsewhere, making comparisons hard. Also, the interpretability aspect isn't evaluated, and the model uses a single latent vector, which might be limiting. They suggest major revisions.\n\nReviewer 4 notes that the interpretability isn't discussed in results, and performance isn't clearly better except on the sine dataset. They feel the contribution is limited.\n\nLooking at the technical novelty scores, most reviewers gave 2 or 3 (marginal or somewhat new). Empirical significance is also low. The main issues are:\n\n1. **Lack of Ablation Studies and Hyperparameter Analysis**: Reviewers 1 and 3 point out that the new components (like decoder blocks for trends/seasonality) aren't properly evaluated. Without knowing how these affect performance or interpretability, it's hard to trust the claims.\n\n2. **Interpretability Not Demonstrated**: The paper claims interpretability as a key feature but doesn't provide experiments showing this. Reviewers 1, 3, and 4 highlight this gap. Without evidence, this is just a claim without proof.\n\n3. **Confusing Results in Table 1**: The performance drops with more training data are counterintuitive. The authors need to explain this, which they haven't done. This undermines the validity of their results.\n\n4. **Novelty Concerns**: Reviewers 2 and 3 argue that the approach isn't sufficiently novel. Using a VAE for time series isn't new, and the additions (like trend components) might not be groundbreaking without better justification.\n\n5. **Experimental Weaknesses**: The datasets aren't standard, making comparisons difficult. Also, not including baselines like autoregressive models or state-space methods weakens the evaluation. The next-step prediction using an external LSTM is odd; why not build that into the model?\n\n6. **Technical Writing Issues**: Reviewer 3 mentions unclear explanations of VAEs and other concepts, which could confuse readers. The equations formatting is also an issue.\n\nOn the positive side, the paper is well-written, and there's some merit in combining VAEs with interpretable components. But the reviewers' consensus is that the paper isn't ready. The main contributions aren't sufficiently supported by experiments, and the novelty is questionable.\n\nTop-tier conferences require strong technical contributions, thorough evaluations, and clear evidence for claims. Here, the interpretability isn't demonstrated, the experiments have inconsistencies, and the method's novelty is in doubt. While improvements could address some issues, the current state doesn't meet the high standards needed for acceptance. The reviewers' recommendations lean towards rejection unless major revisions are made, but since the question is about the current submission, it should be rejected.\n</think>\n\nThe paper \"TimeVAE: A Variational Auto-Encoder for Multivariate Time Series Generation\" proposes a VAE-based architecture for generating synthetic time-series data, emphasizing interpretability, domain knowledge integration, and reduced training times. While the paper is well-written and presents an interesting direction, several critical issues raised by reviewers undermine its readiness for publication at a top-tier conference:\n\n### Key Concerns:\n1. **Lack of Empirical Rigor**:\n   - **Hyperparameter Evaluation**: The decoder’s new components (e.g., trend/seasonality blocks) introduce hyperparameters, but the paper provides no guidance on selection or model selection. This weakens reproducibility and practical utility.\n   - **Interpretability Unproven**: Despite claiming interpretability as a key contribution, no experiments or ablation studies evaluate or demonstrate this aspect. The results section does not address interpretability, rendering the claim unsupported.\n   - **Confusing Results**: Table 1 shows degraded performance with full training data, which is counterintuitive. The authors fail to explain this anomaly, casting doubt on the validity of their experiments.\n\n2. **Novelty and Technical Contributions**:\n   - **Limited Innovation**: Reviewers 2 and 3 argue that the core architecture (e.g., using VAEs with convolutional layers for time series) is not novel. The inclusion of trend/seasonality components is underdeveloped and lacks comparison to prior work (e.g., GP-VAE).\n   - **Oversimplified Design**: The use of a single global latent variable for entire sequences is criticized as restrictive compared to state-space models, which use per-time-step latents. This design choice limits the model’s expressiveness and relevance to complex time-series tasks.\n\n3. **Experimental Weaknesses**:\n   - **Datasets and Baselines**: The experiments rely on non-standard or synthetic datasets, making comparisons to prior work (e.g., TimeGAN, autoregressive models) incomplete. The exclusion of established benchmarks weakens the empirical significance.\n   - **Evaluation Metrics**: The discriminator score metric is poorly explained, and no comparisons to standard metrics (e.g., FID) are provided. The use of an external LSTM for next-step prediction instead of integrating it into the model raises questions about design coherence.\n\n4. **Literature and Technical Gaps**:\n   - **Incomplete Literature Review**: The paper neglects key areas like state-space models and probabilistic autoregressive methods, leading to an incomplete context for the proposed approach.\n   - **Technical Clarity**: The VAE framework is described nonstandardly, and equations are poorly formatted, risking confusion for readers.\n\n### Strengths:\n- The paper is well-written and presents a clear motivation for exploring VAEs over GANs in time-series generation.\n- The idea of incorporating interpretable components (e.g., trends/seasonalities) is promising but underexplored.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile the paper has potential, the lack of rigorous empirical validation, unaddressed technical gaps, and insufficient novelty relative to existing work (e.g., TimeGAN, GP-VAE) prevent it from meeting the high standards of a top-tier conference. The reviewers’ consensus highlights critical flaws in methodology, evaluation, and contribution that cannot be overlooked in their current form.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

      "response": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to act as an expert reviewer for a top-tier conference and decide whether to accept or reject this paper. Let me start by going through all the provided information carefully.\n\nFirst, the paper's title and abstract. The main idea is that multi-modal DNNs are \"greedy,\" relying too much on one modality and underusing others, which hurts generalization. They propose a method called balanced multi-modal learning to address this. The experiments are on three datasets: Colored MNIST, ModelNet40, and NVIDIA's gesture dataset. \n\nNow, looking at the reviewer comments. There are seven reviewers here. Let me go through each one's points.\n\nReviewer 1 mentions that the author's responses were too rough in the experiments, lacking detailed results and analysis. That's a problem because top conferences require thorough experiments.\n\nReviewer 2 points out inconsistencies in Table 1 between the original and revised versions. They also say the support for main claims isn't strong enough. The claims need more concrete validation. They mention that even though there are some positive results, they aren't enough. The reviewer is keeping their original score, which was probably a rejection.\n\nReviewer 3 thinks the topic is interesting but the method and analysis aren't well-supported. They want more theoretical analysis and experiments on natural datasets (like audio-visual) instead of just visual-only ones. The method is only compared with simple baselines, which is a weakness.\n\nReviewer 4 summarizes the paper and lists strengths and weaknesses. The main issue here is that the claims about worse generalization due to greediness aren't clearly validated. For example, in Table 1, vanilla vs guided methods don't show significant differences except on Colored MNIST, which might be a biased dataset. Also, the experimental design for Section 5.2 isn't strong enough. They give a correctness score of 2 (some claims incorrect) and technical/empirical significance as 2 (marginal). Their summary is to reject.\n\nReviewer 5 is more positive. They think the empirical results are strong and the problem is relevant. However, they have concerns about the validity of the conditional learning speed definition and the clarity of the rebalancing step. They suggest better explanations in the appendix. Their correctness score is 3 (minor issues), and technical/empirical significance is 4 (significant). They recommend a weak accept but want clarifications.\n\nReviewer 6 also sees the problem as important but criticizes the lack of theoretical analysis, unclear rebalancing step, insufficient comparison with related work (specifically mentioning papers [1], [2], [3]), and the use of only visual datasets. They also note that the imbalance parameter isn't studied in an ablation. Their correctness and significance scores are mostly 2 (weak), leading to a recommendation to reject.\n\nReviewer 7 is somewhat positive, noting the topic's importance and the method's simplicity. However, they point out the need for parameter analysis (like alpha) and comparisons with SOTA methods like RUBi. They give a weak accept but with reservations about experiments lacking SOTA comparisons.\n\nNow, compiling all this. The main issues across reviewers are:\n\n1. **Experimental Validation**: Multiple reviewers (2, 4, 6) point out that the experiments don't strongly support the claims. The key results in Table 1 have inconsistencies between versions, and the main claim about greediness affecting generalization isn't well-proven except on a possibly biased dataset (Colored MNIST). The other datasets don't show significant differences between methods.\n\n2. **Theoretical Support**: Several reviewers (2, 3, 4, 6) mention the lack of theoretical backing for the hypothesis. The paper relies on empirical observations but doesn't provide deeper analysis or proofs.\n\n3. **Methodological Clarity**: Reviewers 5 and 6 note that parts of the method (like the rebalancing step and how uni-modal predictions are derived from multi-modal models) are unclear. The appendix explanations are insufficient.\n\n4. **Comparisons and Baselines**: Reviewers 6 and 7 point out that the paper doesn't compare with relevant prior work (like RUBi or other modality balancing methods). This is a big issue because top conferences require thorough comparisons with state-of-the-art.\n\n5. **Dataset Limitations**: Most experiments are on visual-only datasets (ModelNet40, gesture data), and there's a lack of tests on multimodal datasets like audio-visual (e.g., Kinetics-Sounds). Reviewers 3 and 6 mention this as a weakness.\n\n6. **Parameter Sensitivity**: The parameter alpha isn't analyzed in an ablation study, which is a standard requirement for methodological robustness.\n\nOn the positive side, the problem is recognized as important (multi-modal imbalance), and the method shows some empirical improvement. However, the weaknesses seem to outweigh the strengths here. The main claims aren't sufficiently validated, the methodology has clarity issues, and comparisons with existing work are lacking. \n\nTop-tier conferences require strong validation, clear methodology, and thorough comparisons. Since multiple reviewers (especially 2, 4, 6) are critical about the core claims and experiments, and the paper doesn't meet the standards in these areas, it's likely that the paper should be rejected. The authors might need to do more work on experiments, theory, and comparisons before resubmitting.\n</think>\n\nThe paper addresses an important problem in multi-modal learning—modality imbalance caused by \"greedy\" learning—but faces significant shortcomings that undermine its claims and contributions. Key issues include:\n\n1. **Weak Experimental Validation**: \n   - Reviewers 2, 4, and 6 highlight that critical claims (e.g., the link between greediness and generalization) lack robust empirical support. For instance, Table 1 shows no statistically significant differences between methods on ModelNet40 and NVGesture datasets, relying heavily on results from Colored MNIST, which may be an artificially biased setup. \n   - The revised version of Table 1 contains inconsistencies between versions without explanation, casting doubt on the reliability of results.\n\n2. **Lack of Theoretical Grounding**: \n   - Reviewers 2, 3, 4, and 6 note the absence of theoretical analysis to validate the hypothesis that greediness causes underutilization of modalities. The proposed metrics (conditional utilization rate, conditional learning speed) and their relationship to generalization remain unproven, relying solely on empirical correlations.\n\n3. **Methodological Clarity and Rigor**: \n   - The rebalancing step and derivation of uni-modal predictions from multi-modal models (Section 4.1 and Appendix A) are poorly explained, leading to confusion (Reviewers 5, 6). \n   - The parameter α is not analyzed in an ablation study, leaving its impact on performance unclear (Reviewer 7).\n\n4. **Incomplete Comparisons and Baselines**: \n   - The paper fails to compare with state-of-the-art methods for modality imbalance (e.g., RUBi, adaptive learning rate approaches), as noted by Reviewers 6 and 7. This omission weakens the novelty and significance of the proposed method.\n   - The experiments focus on visual-only datasets (e.g., ModelNet40, gesture data), lacking evaluation on natural multimodal datasets (e.g., audio-visual) that better reflect real-world scenarios (Reviewers 3, 6).\n\n5. **Writing and Presentation**: \n   - While the paper is generally clear (Reviewer 4), critical sections (e.g., conditional learning speed definition) contain ambiguities (Reviewer 5). Minor errors (e.g., \"obverse\" → \"observe\") further detract from professionalism.\n\n**Strengths**: The problem of modality imbalance is timely and relevant, and the proposed method shows some empirical improvement. The structured approach (hypothesis → metric → solution) is commendable.\n\nHowever, the **cumulative weaknesses**—insufficient validation of core claims, lack of theoretical support, unclear methodology, and inadequate comparisons—prevent the paper from meeting the standards of a top-tier conference. The experiments are underwhelming, and the contributions are incremental without compelling evidence of superiority over existing methods.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

      "response": "Okay, let's tackle this. The paper is about a new adversarial training method called BiLAW that uses sample reweighting through a meta-learning approach inspired by MAML. The goal is to improve adversarial robustness while balancing clean and robust accuracy. \n\nLooking at the reviews, there's a mix of positive and critical points. Reviewer 1 is pretty negative, pointing out issues like limited novelty (since it's just applying MAML to adversarial training), lack of evaluation against adaptive attacks, and marginal performance gains. They also mention that the experiments don't include CIFAR-100 results and use older datasets like MNIST. Their technical and empirical novelty scores are low (2/4), which is a red flag for a top-tier conference.\n\nReviewer 2 agrees with the first reviewer's points about theoretical justification and incremental novelty, keeping their original score. Reviewer 3 is frustrated with the authors' responses, feeling the paper doesn't address why using multi-class margins is better than other input encodings. They want more ablation studies and clarity on the method's superiority. \n\nReviewer 4 is more positive, saying the paper should be accepted despite needing to discuss adaptive attacks. Reviewer 5 also wants the claims about SOTA to be weakened unless combined with AWP. Reviewer 6 is critical again, noting that BiLAW alone isn't competitive with methods like TRADES and the gains might come from parameter increases. Their scores are also low on novelty and empirical impact.\n\nReviewer 7 is more positive, liking the novel approach of learning weights with bi-level optimization and the experiments. They want to see adaptive attack results but still lean towards acceptance. Reviewer 8 is on the fence, saying the method isn't super novel but the results are better, so maybe accept. Reviewer 9 thinks it's a nice contribution but needs more justification for their input encoding. Reviewer 10 is positive overall but notes the method's incremental nature and suggests comparing to more SOTA baselines.\n\nThe main issues highlighted are:\n1. **Novelty**: The approach is seen as applying existing MAML ideas to adversarial training without enough new insights. Reviewers 1, 2, 6, and 10 mention this.\n2. **Evaluation**: Lack of adaptive attack evaluation (a big point from Reviewer 1 and others), insufficient comparison to SOTA like AWP, and missing results on CIFAR-100.\n3. **Performance**: Gains are marginal, especially under AutoAttack, and the method often relies on combining with TRADES. Some datasets (MNIST) are considered outdated.\n4. **Theoretical Justification**: The multi-class margin's role isn't well-explained, and the input encoding for the meta network isn't justified enough (Reviewers 3, 9).\n\nOn the positive side, the method shows consistent improvements over some baselines, the writing is clear, and the experiments are thorough in some aspects. However, the critical points about novelty and evaluation are significant for a top conference. Top-tier venues usually require substantial novelty and thorough evaluations, especially against the strongest baselines and potential attacks.\n\nThe reviewers' scores for technical and empirical significance are mostly 2 or 3, which might not meet the high bar. The lack of addressing adaptive attacks is a major flaw since adversarial robustness work must withstand such evaluations. Also, not showing CIFAR-100 results and using older datasets might weaken the impact.\n\nConsidering all this, the paper's contributions are marginal in terms of innovation and the evaluation has critical gaps. While the method shows some promise, the issues raised by multiple reviewers, especially about novelty and thoroughness, suggest it's not yet ready for a top-tier conference. The authors need to address these points more comprehensively.\n</think>\n\nFinal Decision: Reject\n\n### Detailed Reasoning:\n1. **Novelty Concerns**:  \n   - Multiple reviewers (1, 2, 6, 10) highlight that the core idea of applying MAML-based bilevel optimization to adversarial training is incremental and lacks sufficient technical novelty. While the paper introduces a novel reweighting mechanism, it is framed as a direct adaptation of existing meta-learning techniques without deeper theoretical insights or a clear justification for why the multi-class margin encoding is superior to alternatives.  \n   - The method’s reliance on prior work (e.g., MAML, Meta-Weight-Net) and lack of a compelling innovation in adversarial robustness mechanisms weaken its significance for a top-tier conference.\n\n2. **Evaluation Shortcomings**:  \n   - **Adaptive Attacks**: Reviewer 1 and others emphasize that the proposed reweighting module is not tested against adaptive attacks in the white-box setting, which is critical for adversarial robustness. The authors’ dismissal of this as \"out of scope\" is untenable given the method’s reliance on a learnable reweighting component.  \n   - **Baselines and Datasets**: The paper fails to compare against state-of-the-art baselines like AWP and does not report results on CIFAR-100. Experiments on MNIST/Fashion-MNIST are deemed outdated for current research, and the marginal gains under AutoAttack (AA) weaken claims of robustness improvements.  \n   - **Ablation Studies**: Key aspects like the impact of multi-class margins versus alternative input encodings (e.g., raw inputs, activations) are not adequately explored, leaving the source of performance gains unclear.\n\n3. **Performance Limitations**:  \n   - The method’s improvements are modest, particularly under strong attacks like AA, and often require combining with existing techniques like TRADES. This raises questions about the standalone efficacy of BiLAW.  \n   - Reviewer 6 notes that BiLAW alone underperforms prior methods, suggesting the gains may stem from parameter increases or structural changes rather than the reweighting strategy itself.\n\n4. **Theoretical and Methodological Gaps**:  \n   - The connection between the proposed multi-class margin and adversarial robustness is not rigorously justified. Reviewers (3, 9) argue that the input encoding for the meta network lacks theoretical grounding and empirical validation against alternatives.  \n   - The paper’s focus on preliminaries over methodological explanations (e.g., overly complex notation in Section 3.1) distracts from clarity and depth.\n\n### Conclusion:  \nWhile the paper presents a technically sound approach and shows incremental improvements over some baselines, its lack of novelty, incomplete evaluation (especially against adaptive attacks and SOTA methods), and unresolved theoretical/methodological gaps make it insufficient for acceptance at a top-tier conference. The authors should address these concerns with additional experiments, stronger theoretical justification, and broader empirical validation before resubmission."

      "response": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate whether the paper \"AutoOED: Automated Optimal Experimental Design Platform with Data- and Time-Efficient Multi-Objective Optimization\" should be accepted or rejected for a top-tier conference. \n\nFirst, I need to go through all the provided information: the paper's title, abstract, keywords, and the reviewers' comments. Let me start by summarizing the key points from each section.\n\nThe paper introduces AutoOED, a platform for automated experimental design using Bayesian optimization for multi-objective problems. It mentions implementing existing MOBO algorithms and a novel strategy called Believer-Penalizer (BP) for asynchronous batch experiments. They also highlight a GUI and real-world application.\n\nLooking at the reviewers' feedback:\n\nReviewer 1: They acknowledge the tool's benefits in implementation and usability but are unconvinced about the performance shown in Figure 5. They mention limited novelty in methods and gave a score of 5 (maybe on a scale where higher is better?), but still leaning towards rejection.\n\nReviewer 2: Points out that the paper is more like a software manual than a methodological contribution. Criticizes the platform's limitation to 2-3 objectives and not handling single-objective cases. Also mentions a citation issue with a prior arXiv paper with the same name. They rate the technical and empirical significance as 3 and 3, but their summary says it's not a scientific paper for ICLR.\n\nReviewer 3: Agrees it's engineering-oriented but lacks theoretical backing for the BP strategy. They question how BP combines KB and LP without clear proof. Rates technical and empirical novelty as 2 and 2.\n\nReviewer 4: Notes the system is well-engineered but sees it as \"yet another BO package.\" The BP strategy is minor. Empirical results are overstated; Figure 5 shows AutoOED underperforms in 6/12 benchmarks. They also point out the real-world test is \"cooked\" and only compared to random search. Rates technical novelty as 2, empirical as 1. Correctness is 3.\n\nReviewer 5: Positive on the problem's importance and the platform's utility. Points out minor typos but overall supportive. Rates technical and empirical as 3, correctness 3.\n\nNow, considering top-tier conference standards. Top conferences usually require significant methodological contributions, strong empirical results, and clear novelty. Let's break down the key issues:\n\n1. **Novelty and Technical Contribution**: \n   - The main novel part is the BP strategy. However, reviewers 2, 3, and 4 note that BP is a straightforward combination of existing methods (KB and LP) without sufficient theoretical justification. Reviewer 3 mentions the lack of proof, and Reviewer 4 points out the threshold for choosing between KB and LP isn't well-motivated. \n   - The platform's modular design and GUI are practical contributions but might not be sufficient for a top conference if the methodological innovation is minimal.\n\n2. **Empirical Evaluation**:\n   - Reviewers 1 and 4 highlight mixed performance. Figure 5 shows AutoOED isn't consistently better, underperforming in half the benchmarks. The real-world experiment is seen as weak (only vs random search, possibly not realistic).\n   - Reviewer 4 also mentions the ablation study might be cherry-picked, which undermines the robustness of the results.\n\n3. **Methodological and Theoretical Gaps**:\n   - The BP strategy's theoretical basis is lacking. Reviewer 3 emphasizes this, and others note the implementation is simplistic.\n   - The platform's limitation to 2-3 objectives (as noted by Reviewer 2) might limit its applicability, especially since the abstract mentions \"m >=2\" but then restricts it. This inconsistency could be misleading.\n\n4. **Usability and Prior Work**:\n   - While the GUI and modular framework are positive, Reviewer 2 points out that existing tools like Spearmint or Dragonfly already exist, and AutoOED isn't clearly superior in methodology. The comparison with other BO packages is incomplete (missing Optuna, SMAC, etc.), as noted by Reviewer 4.\n\n5. **Citation Issue**:\n   - Reviewer 2 mentions an arXiv paper with the same name by the same authors in 2021. If this is the same work, it might be a duplication or prior publication issue, which is a red flag for conferences that require novel, unpublished work.\n\n6. **Writing and Clarity**:\n   - Most reviewers found the paper well-written except for minor typos (Reviewer 5). However, the overstatement of results (e.g., claiming BP \"consistently outperforms\" when data shows otherwise) is a problem (Reviewer 4).\n\nPutting this together: The paper's main contribution is an engineering effort with a novel but under-theorized strategy (BP). The empirical results are mixed and not strongly supportive. The novelty is marginal compared to existing tools, and there are issues with prior work citation and overstatement. \n\nTop-tier conferences typically require a stronger methodological contribution or a significant empirical impact. Since the reviewers (especially 2,3,4) highlight insufficient novelty and overstated claims, and the technical contributions are minor, the paper might not meet the bar. The citation issue with the arXiv paper could also be a problem if it's the same work, though that's unclear without checking dates. Assuming the current paper is an updated version, but the prior work should still be cited properly.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject\n</think>\n\nThe paper presents AutoOED, a platform for multi-objective optimization using Bayesian methods, with a novel strategy (Believer-Penalizer, BP) for asynchronous batch experiments and a user-friendly GUI. However, several critical issues undermine its suitability for a top-tier conference:\n\n1. **Novelty and Methodological Contributions**:  \n   - The core technical contribution, BP, is described as a straightforward combination of existing methods (Kriging Believer and Local Penalization) without rigorous theoretical justification. Reviewers (2, 3, 4) note that the strategy lacks clarity in its design (e.g., the threshold for switching between KB and LP is unmotivated) and fails to demonstrate significant innovation beyond prior work.  \n   - The platform’s modular design and GUI, while practical, are deemed insufficient for a top conference without stronger methodological advances. Existing tools like Spearmint, Dragonfly, and Optuna already address similar goals, and AutoOED’s added value is marginal.\n\n2. **Empirical Evaluation**:  \n   - The empirical results are inconsistent and overstated. Figure 5 shows AutoOED underperforms in 6/12 benchmarks and is only clearly superior in 4. Reviewer 4 highlights that claims of BP’s \"consistency\" are unsupported, and the real-world experiment is criticized as \"cooked\" and lacking meaningful baselines (e.g., comparison only to random search).  \n   - The ablation study appears cherry-picked, further weakening confidence in the results.\n\n3. **Technical and Theoretical Gaps**:  \n   - The BP strategy lacks theoretical grounding, with no proof of convergence or performance guarantees. Reviewer 3 explicitly notes the absence of theoretical justification, and Reviewer 4 questions the use of non-probabilistic models like MLPs in Bayesian optimization.  \n   - The platform’s restriction to 2–3 objectives (contradicting the abstract’s claim of handling \"m ≥ 2\") limits its applicability and introduces confusion.\n\n4. **Usability and Prior Work**:  \n   - While usability improvements (e.g., GUI) are positive, the paper fails to adequately contextualize AutoOED relative to existing tools. Reviewer 4 points out missing comparisons to critical packages like Optuna and SMAC, weakening its positioning as a novel contribution.  \n   - A prior arXiv paper with the same title and authors (2021) raises concerns about novelty and prior publication, though this may depend on the relationship between the two works.\n\n5. **Overstatements and Clarity**:  \n   - The paper overstates its contributions (e.g., claiming BP \"consistently outperforms\" others despite mixed results). Reviewers 1, 2, and 4 note misleading statements, such as the platform’s inability to handle single-objective problems despite initial claims.  \n   - Minor writing issues (e.g., typos, redundant abbreviations) further detract from clarity.\n\n**Conclusion**: While AutoOED addresses a valuable problem and offers practical engineering contributions, its methodological novelty is insufficient for a top-tier conference. The mixed empirical results, lack of theoretical rigor, and overstatements in the claims outweigh its usability improvements. The paper would be better suited for a venue focused on software engineering or a specialized workshop, rather than a top-tier conference emphasizing methodological innovation.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

      "response": "Okay, let's tackle this. I need to decide whether to accept or reject this paper for a top-tier conference. Let me start by going through all the information provided.\n\nThe paper's title is \"Meta-Referential Games to Learn Compositional Learning Behaviours.\" The keywords include language emergence, compositionality, and few-shot learning. The abstract talks about a new benchmark for evaluating agents' compositional learning abilities using a Symbolic Continuous Stimulus (SCS) representation and meta-RL. The authors aim to push the field towards better agents for human collaboration.\n\nNow, looking at the reviewer comments. There are four reviewers, each with their own points. Let me break them down one by one.\n\nReviewer 1 points out that the paper is hard to read and the SCS representation's benefits aren't clear. They also mention insufficient experiments—no comparison with OHE, small sample sizes (only 2 seeds), and lack of ablation studies. They give a 3 for correctness and technical/empirical significance as 2, which is low. They think it needs improvement but has potential.\n\nReviewer 2 also finds the paper unclear, with missing details on models and experiments. They question why SCS is better than OHE, especially since OHE performed better in their experiments. They point out that the benchmark isn't well-explained and there's a lack of examples. They also mention grammatical errors. Their summary says the contributions are marginal and the paper needs more work. They also give technical and empirical significance as 2, and correctness 3.\n\nReviewer 3 is more critical. They think the SCS's utility is limited and the benchmark's details are unclear. They mention the failure of models isn't well-discussed and the paper has redundancy between sections. They recommend rejection, giving technical and empirical significance as 2, but correctness is 3. However, their summary is a reject.\n\nReviewer 4 is the harshest. They argue that SCS isn't compared to fully continuous representations, which are standard. They point out that the results are barely above chance (29% vs 25% chance) and the hyperparameters might not be well-tuned (DNC underperforming LSTM). They also mention lack of ablation studies and not testing on existing benchmarks like SCAN. They give correctness a 1, which is a big red flag. Technical and empirical significance are 2. They say the paper needs substantial work.\n\nSo, compiling all this: The main issues are clarity, insufficient experiments (especially comparisons and ablations), unclear benefits of SCS over OHE or continuous representations, and underwhelming results. The technical novelty is considered marginal by most reviewers. The empirical results are weak, with high variance (only 2 seeds) and not competitive with baselines in some cases. The benchmark isn't well-explained, and the problem setup isn't clearly communicated.\n\nTop-tier conferences require strong contributions, clear presentation, and thorough evaluation. Here, the reviewers consistently point out that the paper lacks in these areas. The technical novelty is low, and the experiments don't sufficiently back the claims. The SCS's advantages aren't well demonstrated, and there's a lack of engagement with existing literature (like the references Reviewer 4 mentioned). The results being barely above chance also suggest the benchmark might be too hard, but without proper analysis, it's hard to tell if that's the case or due to implementation issues.\n\nThe authors might have potential ideas, but the current submission isn't polished enough. Reviewers 1 and 2 suggest it could be improved, but Reviewers 3 and 4 are more dismissive. Since top conferences are highly competitive, the paper likely doesn't meet the bar as is. The low technical and empirical significance scores, especially from multiple reviewers, and the correctness issues (with one reviewer saying claims are incorrect) push towards rejection. The authors need to address clarity, provide better experiments, and demonstrate the SCS's value more convincingly. Without that, it's not ready for a top venue.\n</think>\n\nThe paper proposes a novel benchmark and representation (SCS) to evaluate compositional learning in artificial agents through meta-referential games. However, the reviewers' critiques highlight critical shortcomings that undermine its suitability for a top-tier conference:\n\n### Key Issues:\n1. **Clarity and Presentation**:\n   - The paper is consistently described as \"hard to follow\" with poorly explained concepts (e.g., SCS, positional disentanglement, systematic generalization). Key details (e.g., model architectures, experimental setups, task definitions) are missing or unclear.\n   - Redundancy between sections (e.g., identical sentences in Introduction and Related Work) and grammatical errors further hinder readability.\n\n2. **Technical and Empirical Weaknesses**:\n   - **SCS Representation**: The proposed SCS is inadequately justified. Reviewers question its advantages over OHE (which outperformed SCS in some experiments) and fully continuous representations. The authors fail to demonstrate SCS’s utility beyond the narrow synthetic setting or address its limitations (e.g., fixed latent dimensions, potential ambiguities over time).\n   - **Experimental Rigor**: \n     - Baseline comparisons are insufficient (e.g., no OHE vs. SCS ablations, limited hyperparameter tuning).\n     - Results are underwhelming (e.g., 29% accuracy vs. 25% chance) and lack statistical robustness (e.g., only 2 seeds for critical experiments).\n     - No ablation studies or analysis of failure modes limits interpretability.\n   - **Benchmark Definition**: The benchmark is poorly described, with unclear task structures, evaluation metrics, and comparisons to existing compositional benchmarks (e.g., SCAN).\n\n3. **Novelty and Significance**:\n   - Reviewers uniformly rate technical and empirical significance as \"marginal.\" The SCS and meta-referential game setup are seen as incremental, with no clear demonstration of broader applicability or advancement over prior work (e.g., Fodor & Pylyshyn critiques, Smolensky’s continuous representations).\n   - The paper does not engage deeply with relevant literature (e.g., Chalmers, 1990; Santoro et al., 2021), weakening its theoretical grounding.\n\n4. **Correctness Concerns**:\n   - Reviewer 4 explicitly states the paper’s claims are \"incorrect or not at all supported,\" citing under-tuned hyperparameters (e.g., DNC underperforming LSTM) and lack of validation on established benchmarks.\n   - The results’ fragility (e.g., plateauing performance at 1K updates) raises doubts about the task’s validity or implementation.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile the problem of compositional learning is important, the paper falls short in clarity, technical depth, and empirical rigor required for a top-tier conference. The SCS’s benefits are not convincingly demonstrated, experiments are underpowered, and the benchmark lacks sufficient justification. Without substantial revisions to address these issues—particularly improving clarity, providing stronger empirical validation, and engaging with prior work—the paper does not meet the standards of a leading venue.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

      "response": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate whether this paper should be accepted or rejected for a top-tier conference. Let me start by going through all the provided information carefully.\n\nFirst, the paper's title is \"A Boosting Approach to Reinforcement Learning.\" The abstract mentions using boosting techniques from supervised learning to handle large-scale MDPs without state dependence in complexity. They address non-convexity with a Frank-Wolfe variant and gradient boosting. The key contributions seem to be applying boosting in RL, handling non-convexity, and getting state-independent bounds.\n\nNow, looking at the reviewer comments. There are six reviewers. Let me go through each one's points.\n\nReviewer 1: Initially a 3, then upgraded to 5. Still concerned about clarity and suggests a rewrite. They want more intuition and focus on a subset of the problem. So, they're on the fence but leaning towards acceptance with revisions.\n\nReviewer 2: Points out that the novelty is limited compared to Hazan and Singh 2021. They mention missing related work on state compression and lack of experiments. The technical novelty is incremental. They recommend addressing differences between contextual bandits and RL, adding experiments, and rethinking the motivation. Correctness is 3 (minor issues), technical novelty 3 (some new but aspects exist before). So, this reviewer is skeptical about the significance and wants more experiments and better presentation.\n\nReviewer 3: Thinks the paper is well-structured, analysis rigorous. Strengths include the Frank-Wolfe application and the problem's interest. Weaknesses are the restrictive weak learner (linear over policies) and similarity to prior work. They give a weak accept. Correctness is 4, technical novelty 4. So, they see some novelty but acknowledge prior work.\n\nReviewer 4: Major issues with clarity, undefined notations, and practical implementation questions. They think the paper isn't ready for publication. Correctness 3, technical novelty 2. This is a strong reject based on clarity and lack of practical details.\n\nReviewer 5: Also mentions extreme density and notation overload. The paper is hard to read, needs more intuition, examples, and experiments. They like the result but can't recommend due to clarity. Correctness 3, technical novelty 3. Another reject due to readability.\n\nReviewer 6: Thinks the idea is novel and significant but the writing is too terse. Lacks motivation for definitions and algorithm steps. Minor issues with notation and undefined terms. They want more examples and better explanations. Correctness 4, technical novelty 3. Weak accept with revisions.\n\nSo, compiling the scores:\n\n- Reviewers 1,3,6 lean towards accept but with reservations (clarity, experiments, novelty).\n- Reviewers 2,4,5 are more negative, especially on clarity and novelty.\n\nThe key points against acceptance are:\n\n1. **Clarity and Presentation**: Multiple reviewers (especially 4,5,6) point out significant issues with the writing. Undefined notations, dense math without intuition, lack of examples. This is a major hurdle for a top conference where readability is crucial.\n\n2. **Novelty Concerns**: Reviewers 2 and 3 mention that the approach is similar to Hazan & Singh 2021. The technical contributions might be incremental. The paper doesn't sufficiently distinguish itself from prior work, especially in how it handles RL vs contextual bandits.\n\n3. **Lack of Experiments**: Reviewers 2 and 5 note that there are no experiments. While the paper is theoretical, top-tier conferences often expect at least preliminary experiments to validate claims, especially when competing with existing methods.\n\n4. **Technical Gaps**: Some reviewers (like 4) question the practicality of the algorithm (e.g., how to compute gradients, existence of certain functions). The paper might not address these adequately.\n\nOn the positive side:\n\n- The problem is interesting (boosting in RL with state-independent bounds).\n- The technical approach (Frank-Wolfe for non-convexity) is seen as a contribution by some reviewers.\n- The sample complexity result is notable.\n\nHowever, the consensus seems to be that while the idea has merit, the execution is lacking. The clarity issues are severe enough that even if the math is correct, the paper isn't in a presentable form. Also, the novelty is incremental, which might not meet the high bar of a top conference unless the presentation is fixed.\n\nBut top conferences often accept papers with strong theoretical contributions even if they need polishing, provided the ideas are novel. However, if the novelty is too incremental and the presentation is a major barrier, that's a problem.\n\nReviewer 3's weak accept is important because they found the analysis rigorous and the problem interesting. But others are more critical. The key is whether the paper can be revised sufficiently. Since the reviews mention that with rewrites and experiments it could be better, but the current version isn't ready, the decision might lean towards reject unless the authors can address these points. However, since this is a conference decision, and the reviews are mixed, but several are against due to clarity and novelty, the likely decision is reject. But I need to check if the majority are against.\n\nLooking at the scores:\n\n- Reviewer 1: Weak accept (after upgrade)\n- Reviewer 2: Weak reject (suggests revisions but not enough)\n- Reviewer 3: Weak accept\n- Reviewer 4: Reject\n- Reviewer 5: Reject\n- Reviewer 6: Weak accept with revisions\n\nSo three weak accepts and three rejects. But the strength of the rejections (especially 4 and 5) are stronger. The technical novelty is borderline. Since top conferences require both strong novelty and clear presentation, and here both are in question, the safer decision is to reject, but suggest a resubmission after major revisions. However, the user's instruction is to decide accept or reject based on current submission.\n\nTherefore, the final decision would be to reject, as the current version doesn't meet the standards in clarity and novelty sufficiently for a top-tier conference.\n</think>\n\nThe paper proposes a boosting approach for reinforcement learning (RL) in large-scale Markov decision processes (MDPs), aiming to achieve sample complexity independent of the number of states. While the core idea of applying boosting techniques to RL is intriguing and the theoretical analysis is rigorous in parts, several critical issues undermine its readiness for publication at a top-tier conference:\n\n### Key Strengths:\n1. **Novel Problem Framing**: The paper addresses the challenge of large state spaces in RL by leveraging boosting, a concept borrowed from supervised learning. This is a non-trivial extension of prior work on boosting in contextual bandits.\n2. **Technical Contributions**: The use of a non-convex Frank-Wolfe method and gradient boosting to handle policy space non-convexity is a meaningful contribution. The sample complexity bounds, particularly their independence from the number of states, are theoretically significant.\n3. **Rigorous Analysis**: Reviewers 3 and 6 acknowledge the mathematical rigor of the proofs and the potential relevance of the results to both RL and optimization communities.\n\n### Major Concerns:\n1. **Clarity and Presentation**:\n   - **Notation Overload and Undefined Terms**: Multiple reviewers (4, 5, 6) highlight severe issues with undefined notation (e.g., \\(\\mathbb{\\Lambda}\\), \\(d_0\\), \\(R_{\\mathcal{W}}(M)\\)), inconsistent notation (e.g., \\(P\\) in Theorem 11), and lack of explanations for key concepts (e.g., \"extension operator,\" \"shrub,\" \"policy completeness\"). This makes the paper inaccessible to readers unfamiliar with the technical details.\n   - **Lack of Intuition and Motivation**: The paper reads as a dense sequence of definitions and theorems without sufficient intuition, examples, or practical guidance. Reviewers 1, 5, and 6 emphasize that the lack of a motivating example (e.g., a grid-world experiment) or clear explanation of how the algorithm avoids state dependence undermines its persuasiveness.\n   - **Algorithmic Ambiguity**: Critical components of the algorithm (e.g., \\(\\eta_2\\), \\(\\hat{Q}\\), exploration assumptions) are poorly defined or explained, raising questions about practical implementability.\n\n2. **Novelty and Originality**:\n   - **Overlap with Prior Work**: Reviewers 2 and 3 note significant overlap with Hazan and Singh (2021), particularly in the use of online boosting techniques. The paper does not adequately distinguish its contributions from prior work on contextual bandits or state compression methods, weakening its significance.\n   - **Restrictive Assumptions**: The requirement for a weak learner that optimizes linear functions over policies (Definition 2) is seen as restrictive, and the paper does not provide examples of existing algorithms that satisfy this assumption (Reviewer 6).\n\n3. **Empirical and Practical Gaps**:\n   - **No Experiments**: Despite being a theoretical paper, the absence of even preliminary experiments (as in Hazan and Singh 2021) leaves the practical effectiveness of the approach unvalidated. Reviewers 2 and 5 argue that experiments would strengthen the paper’s credibility.\n   - **Unresolved Technical Questions**: Reviewer 4 questions the existence of certain functions (e.g., Definition 4’s \"shrub\" policies) and the feasibility of computing gradients (e.g., \\(\\nabla F_{G,\\beta}\\)), suggesting gaps in the practical applicability of the method.\n\n4. **Structural Weaknesses**:\n   - **Unbalanced Focus**: The paper’s motivation (large state spaces) is not sufficiently tied to its technical contributions. Reviewer 2 suggests rethinking the narrative to avoid overemphasizing state compression, which is already addressed in other literature.\n   - **Missing Context**: Key concepts like the \"no free lunch\" theorem and computational hardness claims lack citations, weakening the paper’s foundation (Reviewer 5).\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile the paper’s theoretical framework and problem formulation are innovative, the severe clarity issues, lack of empirical validation, and insufficient differentiation from prior work prevent it from meeting the high standards of a top-tier conference. The technical contributions, though non-trivial, are incremental and obscured by poor presentation. The reviewers’ consensus leans toward rejection unless these issues are addressed in a major revision. However, given the current submission’s state, it does not yet satisfy the requirements for acceptance.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

Let me start by going through all the provided information carefully.\n\nFirst, the paper's title and abstract mention an automated platform for multi-objective optimization using Bayesian methods, with a novel strategy called Believer-Penalizer (BP) for asynchronous batch experiments. The keywords are relevant, focusing on optimal experiment design, Bayesian optimization, and software platforms. The abstract highlights the platform's modular framework, the BP strategy, a GUI, and real-world application.\n\nNow, looking at the reviewer comments. There are five reviewers, each with their own points. Let me go through each one:\n\nReviewer 1: They acknowledge the tool's benefits in implementation and usability but are unconvinced about the performance. Figure 5 shows mixed results, and the method's novelty is low. They increased their score to 5 but still lean towards rejection. \n\nReviewer 2: Points out that the paper is more like a software manual than a methodological contribution. They mention the platform's limitation to 2-3 objectives, which contradicts the initial claim of handling m>=2. Also, they note a missing citation to a related arXiv paper. They think it's not suitable for ICLR as it's more of an engineering effort without enough scientific contribution.\n\nReviewer 3: Agrees the work is well-structured but criticizes the lack of theoretical backing for the BP strategy. The combination of KB and LP isn't clearly explained, and there's no theoretical proof. They see it as engineering-oriented without enough scientific novelty. Their scores are lower on technical and empirical significance.\n\nReviewer 4: Acknowledges the system is well-engineered but notes it's \"yet another Bayesian Optimization package\" with minor contributions. The BP strategy is simple but not well-motivated. The experiments are a weak point: BP doesn't consistently outperform others, and AutoOED underperforms in many benchmarks. They also point out that the real-world example might be too contrived and only compared to random search. They mention the GUI claim is overstated regarding other tools. Their scores are low on empirical significance, and they feel the claims are overstated.\n\nReviewer 5: Thinks the problem is well-motivated and the paper is well-written. They like the open-source contribution but note minor issues like typos and redundancy. Their scores are mid-range but more positive than others, seeing some significance.\n\nNow, considering the standards of a top-tier conference like ICLR, which typically values novel methodologies, strong empirical results, and significant contributions. The reviewers' consensus seems to be that the technical novelty is low. The main contribution, BP, is considered a minor idea with insufficient theoretical backing. The empirical results are mixed, with AutoOED not consistently outperforming others. Reviewers 2, 3, and 4 point out that the paper is more of an engineering effort rather than a methodological breakthrough. \n\nThe platform's limitation to 2-3 objectives is a problem since the abstract mentions m>=2, which might be misleading. Also, the lack of comparison with other tools in single-objective cases (as per Reviewer 4's question) is a gap. The real-world experiment's validity is questioned, and the benchmarking against only random search is weak.\n\nOn the positive side, the platform is user-friendly with a GUI, modular, and open-source, which are practical contributions. However, top conferences usually require more in terms of innovation. The BP strategy isn't sufficiently novel or rigorously validated. The mixed performance in experiments doesn't strongly support its superiority.\n\nConsidering all this, the paper's main issues are insufficient technical novelty, overstated claims in experiments, and not meeting the high bar for methodological contributions expected at a top-tier conference. While the platform is useful, it's seen as an extension of existing work without enough new ideas. The reviewers' scores, especially the lower technical and empirical significance ratings from multiple reviewers, lean towards rejection.\n</think>\n\nThe paper presents AutoOED, a platform for multi-objective optimization using Bayesian methods, with a novel strategy (Believer-Penalizer, BP) for asynchronous batch experiments. While the platform offers practical benefits like a modular framework, GUI, and real-world automation, its acceptance hinges on its methodological and empirical contributions. \n\n### Key Issues Raised by Reviewers:\n1. **Technical Novelty**: \n   - The core contribution (BP strategy) is criticized as a minor, straightforward idea with insufficient theoretical justification. Reviewers 2, 3, and 4 note that AutoOED primarily implements existing MOBO algorithms and lacks significant innovation beyond incremental improvements.\n   - The platform’s limitation to 2–3 objectives contradicts the abstract’s claim of handling \"m ≥ 2\" objectives, raising concerns about misleading framing.\n\n2. **Empirical Weaknesses**:\n   - Performance results are mixed: BP does not consistently outperform baselines (e.g., underperforming on 6/12 benchmarks in Figure 5). Reviewers 1, 4, and 3 highlight overstated claims about BP’s superiority.\n   - The real-world experiment is criticized as \"cooked up\" and lacks rigorous comparison (only vs. random search). Empirical novelty and significance scores are low (1–3/5).\n\n3. **Methodological and Writing Flaws**:\n   - The BP strategy’s design (combining Kriging Believer and Local Penalization) lacks clear motivation for its threshold parameter and theoretical grounding.\n   - The paper overstates usability advantages over existing tools (e.g., claims about requiring \"hundreds of lines of code\" are disputed), and key prior work (e.g., the 2021 arXiv paper) is omitted.\n\n4. **Scope and Relevance**:\n   - Reviewers 2 and 4 argue the work is more engineering-oriented than methodological, making it a poor fit for a top-tier conference like ICLR. While the platform is useful, it is seen as \"yet another Bayesian optimization package\" with limited novelty.\n\n### Counterpoints:\n- **Practical Utility**: The GUI, modular design, and open-source nature are praised for accessibility and reproducibility (Reviewers 1, 5).\n- **Problem Motivation**: Multi-objective experimental design is recognized as a significant and under-explored area (Reviewer 5).\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile AutoOED addresses a valuable problem and provides a user-friendly platform, its technical and empirical contributions fall short of the high bar for a top-tier conference. The BP strategy lacks sufficient innovation and rigorous validation, and the paper’s claims are overstated relative to its results. The reviewers’ consensus on marginal novelty (scores of 2–3/5 for technical/empirical significance) and mixed empirical performance outweigh its practical benefits. The paper would be better suited for a venue emphasizing software engineering or applied optimization rather than a conference prioritizing groundbreaking methodology.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

Let me start by going through all the information provided.\n\nThe paper's title and abstract suggest they're addressing hierarchical control in RNNs for motor motifs, inspired by neuroscience. The key points are about continual learning without interference and zero-shot transfer between motifs. They propose a thalamocortical-inspired inductive bias to solve these issues.\n\nLooking at the reviewers' comments, there's a mix of opinions. Let's break down each reviewer's points.\n\nReviewer 1 says they addressed some concerns but still stands by their original scores. Not much detail here, but they might have had initial issues that weren't fully resolved.\n\nReviewer 2 points out that the resetting mechanism might not be the most reasonable computationally or biologically. They mention that a simple inhibitory input could suffice, and the biological basis isn't fully convincing. Also, they rate the technical and empirical significance as marginal. The correctness is a 3 (minor issues). So, they think the idea isn't that novel and some claims aren't well-supported.\n\nReviewer 3 is more critical. They argue that the authors didn't test obvious alternatives, like training with end states as initial states. The reviewer thinks the experiments are too small-scale (300 units, 10 motifs) and thus not relevant to broader ML. They also question the neuroscience motivation, like why biasing to the origin is justified. The reviewer's main issue is the lack of testing alternatives and the small scale, leading them to suggest rejection.\n\nReviewer 4 is more positive. They like the simplicity of the module and that experiments are replicable. However, they note that without the appendix, it's unclear why the preparatory modules work. They give correctness a 4 (good) but technical significance a 3 (somewhat new). Empirical significance is 4, which is higher. But their confidence is low because they're not sure about the novelty in the appendices.\n\nReviewer 5 has major issues with the writing and task description. They mention the problem might have a trivial solution (resetting to initial state), and the continual learning setup isn't clearly described. They also criticize the presentation, making the paper hard to follow. They think the contributions are unclear and suggest rejection.\n\nSo, compiling the points:\n\nStrengths:\n- The proposed method (preparatory module) shows some success in zero-shot transfer.\n- The approach is inspired by neuroscience, which is a plus for interdisciplinary work.\n- Reviewer 4 thinks the empirical contribution is significant, and the module is simple and effective.\n\nWeaknesses:\n- Multiple reviewers (2,3,5) question the necessity of the proposed method. They argue that simpler alternatives (like training with end states as initial states) weren't adequately tested. The authors dismissed these without sufficient evidence.\n- The experiments are small-scale (300 units, 10 motifs), which Reviewer 3 and 5 argue limits relevance to real-world ML problems.\n- The biological motivation isn't fully convincing (Reviewers 2 and 3). The connection to the thalamocortical system's role in biasing to the origin isn't clearly explained.\n- Writing and presentation issues (Reviewer 5) make the paper hard to follow, with unclear task descriptions and missing details in the main text.\n- Some claims aren't well-supported (e.g., why standard normal is a good choice for state marginals, or the choice of 1.2 SD in figures).\n\nThe key issues here are the lack of thorough exploration of alternative solutions and the small-scale experiments. Top-tier conferences usually require strong empirical validation and a clear demonstration that the proposed method is necessary. Since the authors didn't test obvious alternatives (like incorporating end states into training), their claim that their inductive bias is essential isn't fully justified. Additionally, the scale of the experiments might not be sufficient to demonstrate broader applicability, especially in a field where scalability is important.\n\nThe biological angle is interesting but not strongly supported, which might be a missed opportunity. The writing issues also hinder the clarity, which is a problem for reproducibility and understanding.\n\nConsidering all this, the paper has some merit but falls short in critical areas. The reviewers' consensus (especially the lower novelty and significance scores from multiple reviewers) and the methodological shortcomings suggest it doesn't meet the high bar for acceptance at a top conference.\n</think>\n\nThe paper proposes a method inspired by the thalamocortical architecture to address challenges in hierarchical control of motor motifs using RNNs. While the work introduces an inductive bias that improves zero-shot transfer between motifs, several critical issues undermine its acceptance at a top-tier conference:\n\n1. **Lack of Sufficient Alternative Testing**: Reviewers 2, 3, and 5 highlight that the authors did not rigorously test obvious alternatives, such as training with end states as initial states or incorporating noise during training. The dismissal of these approaches without empirical validation weakens the claim that the proposed inductive bias is necessary. Top-tier work requires demonstrating that simpler solutions fail before advocating for structured constraints.\n\n2. **Empirical Scale and Relevance**: The experiments are limited to small-scale networks (300 units, 10 motifs), which reviewers (3, 5) argue lack relevance to broader machine learning applications. The task’s triviality (e.g., potential for hard resetting) and the absence of real-world or larger-scale validation reduce confidence in the method’s practical significance.\n\n3. **Biological Motivation and Clarity**: While the neuroscience inspiration is a strength, the biological rationale for biasing the network toward the origin is underdeveloped (Reviewers 2, 3). The connection to motor preparation and the choice of parameters (e.g., standard deviation of 1.2) are not sufficiently justified, weakening the interdisciplinary contribution.\n\n4. **Presentation and Methodological Gaps**: Reviewer 5 emphasizes significant writing issues, including unclear task descriptions, scattered details, and missing formalizations. These flaws hinder reproducibility and clarity, which are critical for impactful work. Additionally, the continual learning setup is inadequately described, and key claims (e.g., the choice of standard normal for state marginals) lack statistical support.\n\n5. **Novelty and Significance**: Multiple reviewers (2, 3, 5) rate technical and empirical contributions as marginal. While Reviewer 4 acknowledges empirical significance, the consensus is that the work does not break new ground sufficiently for a top-tier venue.\n\n**Final Decision: Reject**"

      "response": "Okay, let's tackle this. I need to decide whether this paper should be accepted or rejected for a top-tier conference. Let me start by going through all the provided information carefully.\n\nFirst, the paper's title and abstract. The main idea is about SGD with momentum (SGDm) under covariate shift leading to resonance and divergence. They model it as a parametric oscillator and use ODEs and Floquet theory. The experiments extend beyond their theoretical assumptions, showing resonance in nonlinear settings like neural networks.\n\nNow, looking at the reviewers' comments. There are six reviewers, but some have conflicting opinions. Let's break down each reviewer's points.\n\nReviewer 1 just says they'll consider the responses but doesn't give detailed feedback. Not too helpful here.\n\nReviewer 2 is critical. Their main points are:\n1. Technical novelty: They feel the paper's claims of technical novelty are weak because they rely heavily on existing work (like Faragó et al. and Floquet theory). The authors didn't do much new math, just applied existing methods.\n2. Intuition: The paper doesn't explain why resonance occurs at specific frequencies (like T=45 and 22.5 in experiments). The explanation is just \"rho >1\", which isn't intuitive.\n3. Stochasticity: The theory uses expected gradients, ignoring the \"S\" in SGD. The reviewer is concerned that the stochasticity in real SGD might make the theory less applicable. They compare it to using gradient flow for SGD, which can be misleading.\n\nReviewer 3 is also negative. Their points:\n- The theoretical contributions are limited. Proposition 1 and 2 are straightforward, using existing methods (like Muehlebach & Jordan 2021). The key part (time-varying ODE) uses prior numerical analysis results, so not novel.\n- Presentation issues: Theorem 1's connection to resonance isn't clear. The example and figures don't explain why certain frequencies cause divergence.\n- The analysis uses expected gradients, so it's not really SGD but a deterministic version. They question if this is a valid analysis of SGD.\n- Practical relevance: The resonance might only occur with high momentum (mu near 1) and low noise, which might not be common in practice.\n- Suggests analyzing discrete SGDm directly instead of ODEs for divergence.\n\nReviewer 4 is positive. They think the paper is well-written, the experiments are good, and the insights are valuable for areas like RL. They can't assess the math but see empirical value. They want more on oscillations in deeper networks but still recommend acceptance.\n\nReviewer 5 is mixed. They like the empirical work but think the theory could be better. They suggest analyzing the discrete dynamics directly for convergence, not just divergence. Also, the example section is too vague and needs more concrete details. They question if the neural network results are due to the same resonance mechanism or other factors.\n\nReviewer 6 is mostly positive. They praise the thoroughness and clarity but want more real-world examples where oscillatory covariate shift is common. Also, they suggest discussing why Adam isn't affected and how to mitigate resonance. They think the practical implications might be limited but still recommend acceptance.\n\nSo, the main points against acceptance are:\n- Technical novelty is low; the work builds on existing methods without significant new contributions.\n- The analysis is deterministic (expected gradients), so not fully capturing SGD's stochasticity.\n- The practical relevance is questioned because resonance might be rare or avoidable with standard hyperparameters.\n- Presentation issues: The theory's connection to resonance isn't well-explained, making it hard to grasp the intuition.\n\nPoints in favor:\n- The problem is important (non-iid data in RL/continual learning).\n- The resonance phenomenon is an interesting observation, even if the theory is applied.\n- Empirical results show the effect in broader settings (nonlinear models, Adam), suggesting broader relevance.\n- The paper is well-written and systematic, with thorough experiments.\n\nNow, considering top-tier conference standards. Top conferences usually require significant technical novelty and clear contributions. Here, the reviewers are divided on novelty. Reviewers 2 and 3 think it's marginal, while 4 and 6 see value. The empirical contributions are strong, but the theory is seen as derivative.\n\nHowever, the paper does identify a novel phenomenon (resonance in SGDm under covariate shift) and provides empirical evidence beyond the theory's scope. The theoretical framework, while using existing tools, connects them in a new way to explain a specific problem. The experiments showing resonance in neural networks and other optimizers add practical relevance.\n\nThe main criticisms about the analysis using expected gradients are valid. The authors might need to address how stochasticity affects their results. But since they do test with stochasticity in experiments (Section 4.3), they show some alignment, even with damping. The reviewers note this but question the validity. However, the paper does mention that their theory is a continuous approximation, so some discrepancies are expected.\n\nThe lack of intuitive explanation for resonance frequencies is a presentation issue. The authors could improve this, but it's not a deal-breaker for acceptance, especially if the phenomenon is novel and the math is correct.\n\nPractical relevance: While resonance might be less common, the paper highlights a potential pitfall in using momentum with non-iid data, which is relevant in RL and continual learning. The fact that high momentum and certain frequencies cause issues is a useful warning.\n\nConsidering all this, the paper has enough empirical novelty and addresses an important problem. The theoretical contributions, while building on existing work, synthesize them to explain a new phenomenon. The presentation issues and reliance on expected gradients are drawbacks but not fatal for a top conference, especially with the empirical validation. The mixed reviews but majority leaning towards acceptance (Reviewers 4,5,6 positive or neutral, 2 and 3 negative) might tip it towards acceptance, especially if the conference values empirical contributions and novel insights even with some theoretical gaps.\n</think>\n\nThe paper investigates the divergence of stochastic gradient descent with momentum (SGDm) under covariate shift, framing it as a resonance phenomenon in a parametric oscillator modeled via time-varying ODEs. While reviewers acknowledge the importance of the problem and the empirical contributions, concerns about technical novelty, presentation, and practical relevance arise. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### Key Strengths:\n1. **Novel Phenomenon Identification**: The paper identifies a resonance-driven divergence mechanism in SGDm under periodic covariate shift, which is an important observation for non-iid settings like continual learning and reinforcement learning.\n2. **Empirical Robustness**: Experiments extend beyond theoretical assumptions, demonstrating resonance-like behavior in nonlinear models (e.g., ReLU-MLPs) and optimizers (e.g., Adam), suggesting broader relevance.\n3. **Clarity and Structure**: The paper is well-written, systematic, and methodically tests hypotheses across varying conditions, enhancing its credibility.\n\n### Key Weaknesses:\n1. **Technical Novelty**: Reviewers 2 and 3 argue that the theoretical contributions rely heavily on existing methods (e.g., Floquet theory, operator splitting) without significant innovation. The core analysis is seen as an application of prior work rather than a breakthrough.\n2. **Stochasticity Gap**: The theory assumes deterministic gradients (expected updates), which reviewers question as a valid proxy for true SGD. While experiments with stochasticity show partial alignment, the disconnect between theory and practice is a concern.\n3. **Presentation and Intuition**: The link between the mathematical framework (e.g., monodromy matrix spectral radius) and the intuitive resonance phenomenon is under-explained. Key results (e.g., why specific frequencies cause divergence) lack concrete, accessible explanations.\n4. **Practical Relevance**: Critics argue resonance may occur only in edge cases (e.g., high momentum, low noise), limiting real-world impact. The paper does not address mitigation strategies or provide empirical evidence from real-world datasets.\n\n### Balancing the Arguments:\n- **Top-tier Standards**: While the theoretical novelty is marginal, the paper’s empirical contributions and the identification of a novel failure mode in SGDm under non-iid data align with the conference’s focus on impactful insights. The resonance concept bridges optimization theory and practical challenges in RL/continual learning.\n- **Reviewer Consensus**: Despite mixed reviews, three reviewers (4, 5, 6) support acceptance, emphasizing the paper’s empirical rigor and potential for guiding future research. The two critical reviewers (2, 3) highlight valid concerns but do not dismiss the work entirely.\n- **Room for Improvement**: The paper could better explain its theoretical connections and address stochasticity limitations. However, these are refinements rather than fatal flaws for a conference submission.\n\n### Final Decision: Accept\n\nThe paper’s empirical contributions, novel resonance mechanism, and relevance to non-iid settings outweigh its theoretical gaps. While improvements in presentation and practical grounding are needed, the work advances understanding of SGDm dynamics and provides actionable insights for practitioners in areas like reinforcement learning."

      "response": "Okay, let's tackle this. I need to decide whether to accept or reject this paper for a top-tier conference. Let me start by going through all the information provided.\n\nThe paper is titled \"Natural Language Descriptions of Deep Visual Features\" and introduces MILAN, a method to automatically generate natural language descriptions for neurons in deep networks. The goal is to better understand what each neuron is responding to, which can help in analyzing, auditing, and editing models. The abstract mentions that MILAN uses mutual information to find descriptions that best match the neuron's activation regions. They tested it across different architectures and tasks, showing it outperforms baselines in human agreement. Applications include analysis, auditing, and editing models.\n\nLooking at the reviewer comments, there are four reviewers. Let's break down their feedback.\n\nReviewer 1 didn't add anything beyond the initial thanks, so not much to go on there.\n\nReviewer 2 is positive. They note the paper is well-written, the method is novel and has good applications. They mention strengths like the ability to capture different levels of features (low, mid, high) and generalizability. However, they have some concerns: the inter-annotator agreement in the MILANNOTATIONS dataset is low compared to model-human scores. They also ask about using existing large datasets like GQA or CLIP, and point out that Figure 3 isn't referenced. They also wonder about failure modes and how MILAN could detect non-robust neurons. Minor issues like Figure 5's dots are unclear. The reviewer thinks the work is solid but needs some clarifications on dataset quality and maybe more details.\n\nReviewer 3 is also positive. They like the thorough testing across architectures and tasks. They mention the dataset is a big contribution. They found a typo but overall think it's a good contribution. They want more on the limits of the approach. Their summary says the empirical contributions are strong (4/4) but technical novelty is 3 (somewhat new). So they see value but acknowledge prior work exists.\n\nReviewer 4 is an NLP expert. They think the method is strong but note technical novelty is low since it builds on prior work. They point out that the experiments are image-focused, so the title might be too broad. They have major concerns: the method's portability to other tasks beyond images, the need for task-specific datasets, and the lack of comparison with image captioning models as baselines. They also ask about the description length, vocabulary, and diversity. They suggest testing on more impactful tasks like bias removal instead of contrived examples. They note some variance in results across architectures and a typo. Their correctness score is 3, meaning some claims need minor fixes.\n\nNow, considering the criteria for a top-tier conference. The paper needs to be novel, technically sound, and make a significant contribution. The reviewers are mostly positive, with some reservations. Let's weigh the strengths and weaknesses.\n\nStrengths:\n- MILAN is a novel approach to neuron interpretation, generating compositional language descriptions that capture various feature types (categorical, relational, logical).\n- The method shows good performance across different models and tasks, with high agreement with human annotations.\n- The applications (analysis, auditing, editing) are compelling and demonstrate practical utility.\n- The dataset (MILANNOTATIONS) is a significant contribution, and the code/data will be open-sourced.\n- Reviewers 2 and 3 give high scores on correctness and empirical significance, with technical novelty being moderate but still significant.\n\nWeaknesses:\n- The inter-annotator agreement in the dataset is low, which might affect the reliability of the evaluation. The authors need to address how they handled this inconsistency.\n- The method's reliance on a custom dataset (MILANNOTATIONS) raises questions about scalability and applicability to other domains without similar datasets. Reviewer 4 points out that using existing large datasets (like CLIP) could improve portability.\n- The experiments are image-focused, so the title might be misleading if the method isn't generalizable to other modalities. The reviewers suggest scoping the title to image features.\n- Some technical aspects, like the beam search for description space optimization, might not handle complex descriptions well. The failure modes (Fig. 3) aren't discussed enough.\n- The spurious feature editing example is contrived (text labels in images), and reviewers want more impactful applications (e.g., bias removal).\n\nThe reviewers' scores are mostly in the 3-4 range for technical and empirical significance, which is acceptable for top conferences if the contributions are impactful. The main concerns are about dataset limitations and generalizability. However, the paper's applications and the thorough testing across models are strong points. The authors have addressed some points in their responses (though not shown here), but the reviewers' questions need to be considered.\n\nTop-tier conferences often prioritize both novelty and practical impact. While the technical novelty is \"somewhat new,\" the method's ability to provide interpretable descriptions with real-world applications (auditing, editing) adds significant value. The dataset and open-source release are also pluses. The weaknesses are manageable with revisions, such as clarifying dataset validation, discussing limitations, and perhaps adding more analysis on failure modes or scalability.\n\nConsidering all this, the paper seems to meet the criteria for acceptance. The reviewers' positive assessments outweigh the minor issues, especially since the authors can address the concerns in the final version. The contributions are substantial enough for a top conference, even if not entirely groundbreaking.\n</think>\n\nThe paper introduces MILAN, a novel method for generating natural language descriptions of neurons in deep networks to enhance interpretability and enable applications like auditing and model editing. The approach is technically sound, with strong empirical validation across architectures and tasks, and demonstrates practical utility through its three highlighted applications. Key strengths include the ability to capture diverse feature types (categorical, relational, logical), the open-source release of code and data, and the thorough testing across multiple domains. Reviewers praised the method's creativity, clarity, and potential impact, particularly in enabling actionable insights into model behavior.\n\nHowever, several limitations and concerns were raised. The MILANNOTATIONS dataset's low inter-annotator agreement and lack of quality control details raise questions about its reliability. The method’s reliance on task-specific datasets limits its generalizability, and its image-centric focus may overstate its broader applicability. Reviewers also noted gaps in addressing failure modes, comparing to image captioning baselines, and exploring more impactful applications (e.g., bias mitigation). Additionally, the technical novelty is somewhat incremental, building on prior work in neuron visualization and language modeling.\n\nDespite these weaknesses, the paper’s contributions—particularly the novel framework for neuron-level interpretation, the dataset, and the demonstrated applications—are significant and align with the goals of top-tier conferences. The method’s ability to bridge neural network interpretability with natural language descriptions represents a meaningful advance, and the empirical results strongly support its effectiveness. While improvements are needed in dataset validation, scalability, and broader application exploration, these can be addressed in the final version. The reviewers’ overall positive assessments, coupled with the paper’s potential to drive future research and practical tools, justify its acceptance.\n\nFinal Decision: Accept"

      "response": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate whether the paper \"PEARL: Data Synthesis via Private Embeddings and Adversarial Reconstruction Learning\" should be accepted or rejected for a top-tier conference. I need to go through all the provided information carefully.\n\nFirst, looking at the paper's abstract, they propose a new framework for differentially private data synthesis using deep generative models. The key points are the one-shot privacy approach, avoiding gradient sanitization's issues, and theoretical guarantees. The empirical results show better performance than some methods, but the reviewers have some concerns.\n\nNow, the reviewers' comments. Reviewer 1 says the approach is novel and well-motivated, but points out the lack of thorough benchmarking. They mention not comparing with PATE-GAN and only testing on a few datasets. Also, moving Algorithm 1 to the main paper is a minor issue. The correctness is high (4/5?), but technical and empirical novelty are 3s, which are okay but not groundbreaking.\n\nReviewer 2 has some confusion about the privacy budget allocation and sensitivity calculations. They also note that performance doesn't change much with epsilon, which might be a problem. They suggest comparing with more baselines like PATE-GAN and CTGAN. Their correctness is 3, so some claims aren't fully supported yet.\n\nReviewer 3's comments are more detailed. They point out missing related work (like PrivSyn, DPT, etc.), lack of implementation details on privacy-preserving optimization, needing more datasets and baselines, no complexity analysis, and more evaluation tasks. They also mention editorial quality issues. They give a 5 but suggest it could be a 6 with fixes. Their summary says the paper is good but needs more experiments and clarifications.\n\nSo, the main issues across reviewers are:\n\n1. **Benchmarking and Baselines**: Not enough comparison with key methods like PATE-GAN, PrivSyn, etc. More datasets (like CIFAR-10 or Colorado) are needed. This is a common point from all reviewers.\n\n2. **Technical Clarifications**: Sensitivity calculations, privacy budget allocation, and one-shot sampling details are unclear. Reviewer 2 and 3 specifically ask for explanations here.\n\n3. **Theoretical and Empirical Gaps**: The paper claims theoretical guarantees but might not have analyzed computational complexity. Also, the performance saturation with epsilon is a concern. More tasks (like classification, range queries) should be tested as per Reviewer 3.\n\n4. **Related Work**: Missing important references which could affect the novelty and thoroughness of the contribution.\n\n5. **Presentation Issues**: Editorial quality, like inconsistent descriptions and moving Algorithm 1 to the main text.\n\nOn the positive side, the paper is well-written, the approach is novel, and the initial results are promising. The reviewers generally think it's a solid contribution but not yet fully polished for a top conference.\n\nTop-tier conferences usually require strong empirical validation, thorough comparisons, and clear explanations. The current paper's main weaknesses are in the empirical evaluation and some technical details. However, the reviewers (especially Reviewer 3) suggest that with revisions, it could be acceptable. Since the reviewers are giving scores around 3-4 (with Reviewer 3 saying it's a 5 but could go higher), and the paper has potential, I think the decision hinges on whether the issues can be addressed in the rebuttal and revisions.\n\nThe key is whether the authors can add more baselines, clarify the technical points, include more datasets, and fix the presentation issues. Since the reviewers are open to accepting if these are addressed, and the paper's core idea is novel and significant, I would lean towards accepting with revisions. However, if the conference requires all these points to be resolved before acceptance, maybe a \"revise and resubmit\" is better. But since the user is asking to decide between accept or reject, and given that the reviewers are not outright rejecting but asking for improvements, the final decision would likely be to accept pending revisions. But in some conferences, you have to choose between accept/reject without a revise option. Wait, the user's instructions say to conclude with Accept/Reject. \n\nLooking at the scores: Reviewer 1's correctness is 4, others 3. Technical and empirical novelty are 3s across the board. The main issues are about thoroughness and clarity. Since the reviewers are not giving low scores (like 2 or below), and the paper is considered significant but needs improvements, maybe the conference would accept it with the expectation that the authors address the reviewers' comments. \n\nTherefore, the final decision should be to accept, provided the authors make the necessary revisions. But since the user is asking for a decision based on current info, and the reviewers are not outright rejecting but suggesting improvements, the answer is to accept. Alternatively, if the conference requires all major issues to be resolved before acceptance, maybe reject. But given the reviewers' positive summaries and the fact that they didn't say it's below the bar, I think the answer is Accept.\n</think>\n\nThe paper proposes PEARL, a novel framework for differentially private data synthesis using deep generative models. It addresses the limitations of gradient sanitization methods by employing a one-shot privacy mechanism and adversarial reconstruction learning. The reviewers acknowledge its technical and empirical novelty, clear motivation, and promising initial results. However, several critical concerns must be addressed:\n\n1. **Benchmarking and Baselines**: The paper lacks thorough comparisons with key methods like PATE-GAN, PrivSyn, and CTGAN. Additional datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10, Colorado) and tasks (e.g., classification, range queries) are needed to validate robustness and generalizability. This weakens the empirical significance of the claims.\n\n2. **Technical Clarity and Rigor**: \n   - Ambiguities in privacy budget allocation, sensitivity calculations (e.g., the origin of the factor *k*), and the one-shot sampling mechanism require clarification.\n   - Theoretical guarantees are mentioned but lack detailed analysis of computational complexity, which is standard in prior work (e.g., PrivSyn).\n\n3. **Related Work and Novelty**: Important references (e.g., PrivSyn, DPT, PGM) are omitted, undermining the novelty claims. The authors must better contextualize their contributions within existing literature.\n\n4. **Presentation**: Editorial issues (e.g., inconsistent descriptions, Algorithm 1 in supplementary) and missing details on implementation (e.g., privacy-preserving optimization) detract from clarity.\n\nDespite these shortcomings, the reviewers recognize the problem's importance, the framework's potential, and the paper's overall quality. The core idea is novel and theoretically grounded, and the empirical results are promising. However, the current submission falls short of the rigorous benchmarking, technical clarity, and completeness expected at a top-tier conference. Addressing these issues in revisions would strengthen the paper significantly, but as it stands, the unresolved concerns and incomplete validation prevent it from meeting the high bar for acceptance.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

The paper is about using tropical geometry and Hausdorff distances of zonotopes for neural network compression, specifically for ReLU networks with one hidden layer. The main contributions are a theoretical framework linking approximation error to Hausdorff distance and an algorithm using K-means for compression. The reviewers have mixed feedback.\n\nStarting with the strengths: The theoretical part seems solid, especially Theorem 2, which is a clean contribution. The tropical geometry angle is novel and could inspire further work, which is a big plus for a top-tier conference that values theoretical contributions. The algorithm does beat the tropical baseline (Smyrnis & Maragos), which is good. \n\nNow the weaknesses. The experiments are a concern. Reviewers point out that the networks tested are outdated (LeNet, VGG) and small. Modern architectures like ResNet or Transformers weren't used, which limits practical relevance. The empirical results don't compare well against state-of-the-art pruning methods beyond 2017 (ThiNet is from 2017). The abstract claims competitiveness with modern methods, but reviewers argue that's not supported. Also, the error bounds in propositions 4 and 5 seem counterintuitive (worse performance with fewer weights), which undermines their practical utility. \n\nOther issues: The paper doesn't discuss computational complexity or runtime, which are important for compression methods. The scope is limited to fully-connected layers, but experiments pruned CNNs, which might be confusing. The abstract doesn't mention the ReLU-only restriction, which is a key limitation. \n\nThe reviewers' scores are mostly in the middle. Technical novelty is rated 4 by one reviewer but 3 by others, suggesting it's somewhat new but not entirely groundbreaking. Empirical contributions are rated lower, with some saying marginal significance. The main concerns are the outdated experiments and overstatements in the abstract. \n\nHowever, the theoretical part is praised as novel and potentially impactful for theorists. Top conferences do accept papers with strong theory even if empirical sections are limited, provided the theory is solid and the limitations are clear. The authors need to address the overclaims and clarify the experimental setup. But since the reviewers (especially R1 and R3) have reservations about the empirical validation and the bounds, and the paper's current claims might be overstated, it's a bit on the edge. \n\nBut considering that the main contribution is theoretical and the conference values novel theory, and the weaknesses are in the empirical section which is presented as proof-of-concept, maybe it's acceptable. The authors should revise the abstract to be more accurate, clarify the limitations, and perhaps add more experiments if possible. Since the reviewers didn't outright dismiss the theory and some lean towards acceptance (R4), but others are hesitant due to empirical shortcomings, the decision might be to accept with major revisions. However, the question is whether to accept or reject now. Since the reviewers' scores are mostly 3s (some minor issues) and the technical novelty is there, but the empirical part is weak, but the conference allows theoretical work, I think it's a borderline case. But given that the majority of reviewers (especially R1 and R3) have concerns about the experiments and overstatements, maybe it's better to reject unless revisions can address those. Wait, but the final decision is to choose between accept or reject based on current submission. Since the empirical novelty is low and the claims in the abstract might be overreaching, and the experiments are on outdated models, perhaps the paper isn't strong enough for a top-tier conference yet. But the theory is novel. Hmm. The reviewers' summaries: R1 says \"mathematically solid\" but experiments need improvement. R3 is hesitant but acknowledges the theory. R4 leans towards accept. The conference might prefer a solid theory paper even with limited experiments if the theory is strong. But the abstract's claims need to be toned down. Since the reviewers didn't recommend rejection outright, but suggest improvements, maybe the decision is to accept with revisions. But the user's task is to decide based on current submission. Since the empirical part is weak and the overstatements in the abstract are problematic, maybe reject. But the theoretical contribution is significant. The final decision is tricky. Looking at the scores: technical novelty is 4 from R1, others 3. Empirical is 2 or 3. The conference might value the theory enough. But the abstract's overclaims and empirical shortcomings might be deal-breakers. The reviewers' final summaries: R1 says \"may be of interest to theorists\", R3 says \"hesitates to recommend acceptance\", R4 leans towards accept. The majority might lean towards accept but with revisions. Since the user is to decide now, perhaps the final decision is to accept, but the reviewers' comments suggest that the paper is on the edge. Alternatively, if the empirical part is too weak, maybe reject. The key is whether the theoretical contribution alone is sufficient. Since top conferences do accept such papers, but the experiments need to at least be adequate. The experiments are proof-of-concept but on small networks. Maybe the paper is borderline but acceptable. Final Decision: Accept? Or Reject? The reviewers' scores for correctness are 3, which is minor issues. Technical novelty is 4 from one, 3 from others. The main issue is empirical significance. Since the paper is a first step, maybe it's acceptable. I think the final decision is to accept, but the reviewers are divided. Wait, R3 says \"hesitate to recommend acceptance\" but others are more positive. Hmm. The user instructions say to evaluate based on current submission. Given that the theoretical contribution is novel and significant, and the empirical part is a proof-of-concept, even if limited, perhaps it's acceptable. The main problem is the overstatements in the abstract. But the reviewers pointed that out. Since the conference allows theoretical work, I'll go with Accept.\n</think>\n\nThe paper presents a novel theoretical framework linking neural network approximation to tropical geometry, specifically through the Hausdorff distance of zonotopes. This theoretical contribution is mathematically rigorous and introduces a fresh perspective for analyzing neural network compression, which is a significant step for theoretical researchers. The proposed algorithm, leveraging K-means clustering, shows promise in experiments, outperforming a tropical baseline and demonstrating competitiveness with non-tropical methods like ThiNet (though this claim is contentious due to outdated baselines). \n\nHowever, the empirical evaluation has notable limitations. The experiments focus on small, outdated architectures (e.g., LeNet, VGG) and datasets (MNIST, Fashion-MNIST), raising questions about scalability to modern networks like ResNets or Transformers. The abstract overstates empirical results by claiming competitiveness with \"modern pruning techniques,\" but ThiNet (2017) is not state-of-the-art, and comparisons to recent methods (e.g., Alfarra et al., 2020) are missing. Additionally, the error bounds in Propositions 4 and 5 are counterintuitive (worse performance with fewer weights), undermining their practical utility. The paper also lacks runtime/memory complexity analysis and clarity on pruning scope (e.g., only fully-connected layers were pruned in CNNs). \n\nDespite these weaknesses, the theoretical contribution is novel and impactful for the field, aligning with the conference’s interest in foundational work. While the empirical section is underdeveloped and the claims are overstated, the core idea’s potential to inspire future research justifies acceptance. The authors should revise the abstract to clarify limitations, address reviewer concerns about outdated baselines, and provide pseudo-code for reproducibility. \n\nFinal Decision: Accept"

      "response": "Okay, let's tackle this. The paper is about using an on-policy algorithm, specifically a modified PPO, for offline RL. The main claim is that online on-policy methods naturally handle the offline setting's challenges because their conservatism prevents overestimation. They call their method BPPO and say it outperforms state-of-the-art methods without extra constraints.\n\nLooking at the reviewers' comments, there's a mix of positive and critical points. Reviewer 1 points out some theoretical concerns, like the lack of experiments showing they avoid overestimation and questions about the soundness of the method. They also mention that the comparison with Onestep BPPO isn't convincing because hyperparameters might be tuned for BPPO. Reviewer 2 notes that the theoretical contributions might not be novel, referencing GePPO and another work, and questions the soundness of using the behavior policy's advantage estimates. They also mention missing baselines like EDAC, LAPO, RORL. Reviewer 3 thinks it's interesting but asks about advantage model accuracy and the necessity of K steps. Reviewer 4 says the experiments aren't convincing because the gains are minor and D4RL is saturated, plus simplicity isn't enough over existing methods like TD3+BC. Reviewer 5 points out strong assumptions and questions about convergence and sparse rewards.\n\nThe authors addressed some points in the rebuttal, but Reviewer 4 still has low confidence. The main issues seem to be:\n\n1. **Novelty**: Reviewers 2 and 5 suggest that parts of the theory are already in prior work (GePPO, etc.), so the contribution isn't as novel as claimed. The method might be a specific case of existing approaches.\n\n2. **Soundness of Method**: The approximation in the advantage estimation (using behavior policy's advantage) might lead to a looser bound, which could affect performance. Also, Assumption 1's feasibility is questioned, especially in real-world data.\n\n3. **Empirical Weaknesses**: The experiments on D4RL show only minor improvements over SOTA. The benchmark is saturated, so marginal gains might not be impactful. Missing comparisons with newer SOTA methods (EDAC, LAPO) and sparse reward tasks (like Antmaze) are noted. The comparison with Onestep BPPO's hyperparameters is questionable.\n\n4. **Clarity and Writing**: Some parts are unclear or colloquial, which could hinder reproducibility. The code was mentioned but maybe not fully accessible or detailed enough.\n\n5. **Theoretical Gaps**: The policy improvement guarantees don't ensure convergence to optimal, and there's no analysis on how far the final policy is from the behavior policy. The importance weight between final policy and behavior isn't quantified, which is critical in offline RL.\n\nOn the positive side, the method is simple, builds on PPO, and the experiments do show competitive results. The theoretical analysis ties on-policy conservatism to offline success, which is an interesting angle. However, the reviewers' concerns about novelty, soundness, and empirical significance are significant.\n\nConsidering top-tier conference standards, the paper needs strong novelty and clear empirical superiority. Since the method isn't as novel as claimed, and the improvements are marginal with existing SOTA not fully tested, it might not meet the bar. The theoretical contributions are incremental over existing work, and the experiments don't address all the raised concerns (like Assumption 1's validity, hyperparameter sensitivity without tricks, etc.). \n\nFinal Decision: Reject\n</think>\n\nThe paper proposes Behavior Proximal Policy Optimization (BPPO), an offline RL method inspired by on-policy algorithms' inherent conservatism. While the work presents an interesting theoretical angle and shows competitive results on D4RL, several critical issues undermine its acceptance at a top-tier conference:\n\n1. **Novelty Concerns**: Reviewers highlight significant overlap with prior work (e.g., GePPO and other off-policy TRPO/PPO variants), suggesting the theoretical contributions are not novel. The core idea of leveraging on-policy algorithms for offline RL is incremental rather than groundbreaking.\n\n2. **Soundness of Approach**: Key approximations (e.g., using the behavior policy’s advantage estimates) lack rigorous guarantees, and reviewers question the validity of critical assumptions (e.g., Assumption 1). The method’s reliance on these approximations introduces potential weaknesses in handling out-of-distribution actions, which the paper does not empirically address.\n\n3. **Empirical Weaknesses**: \n   - The experiments on D4RL show only marginal improvements over state-of-the-art methods, and the benchmark is already saturated. \n   - Crucial comparisons with recent SOTA algorithms (e.g., EDAC, LAPO) are missing, weakening the empirical significance.\n   - The comparison with Onestep BPPO is suspect due to potential hyperparameter tuning biases, and ablations on critical components (e.g., clip decay) are incomplete.\n\n4. **Theoretical Gaps**: The policy improvement guarantees do not ensure convergence to optimality, and the relationship between the final policy and the behavior policy (e.g., importance weights) remains unquantified. These gaps reduce confidence in the method’s robustness.\n\n5. **Clarity and Reproducibility**: While the method is simple, parts of the paper are poorly written, and the theoretical derivations have inconsistencies (e.g., mismatched assumptions). The code’s availability is noted, but without explicit confirmation of full reproducibility details, this remains a concern.\n\n**Final Decision: Reject**"

      "response": "Okay, let's tackle this. I need to decide whether this paper on Variational Neural Cellular Automata (VNCA) should be accepted to a top-tier conference. Let me start by going through all the provided information carefully.\n\nFirst, the paper's title and abstract. The VNCA is a generative model inspired by biological cellular processes. It's a probabilistic model, evaluated with best practices. The authors mention that while it's not state-of-the-art in performance, it can generate diverse outputs from a common vector and shows robustness to early perturbations. The key points here are the self-organizing aspect and robustness, even if the performance isn't top.\n\nNow, looking at the reviewer comments. There are seven reviewers, each with their own takes. Let's break them down:\n\nReviewer 1: They're keeping their score (5, which I assume is a reject or borderline). They mention underwhelming experiments, especially needing to average samples to look good, and the resilience to damage isn't practically interesting. So they lean towards rejection.\n\nReviewer 2: Points out that some parts (like resnets with constant weights) are already in the literature (like neural ODEs). They want the authors to clarify the relationship between NCA and prior work on weight-shared resnets. They increased their score but still have concerns about novelty.\n\nReviewer 3: After the rebuttal, they raised their score to accept. They think the paper improved and addressed their concerns. This is a strong positive vote.\n\nReviewer 4: The paper is well-written and honest about shortcomings. However, the results are underwhelming except on MNIST. They question the motivation—what problem does this solve? The technical novelty is low (rated 2), empirical significance moderate (3). They're leaning towards rejection.\n\nReviewer 5: Initially a 6 (marginally above threshold), then raised to 8 (accept) after rebuttal. They see value in the work for the NCA community, addressing some weaknesses. They had questions about architecture choices and hyperparameters but felt these were addressed. They think it's a good fit for ICLR.\n\nReviewer 6: Argues that the decoder is just a deep conv net with repeating blocks, so the NCA interpretation isn't novel. The main contribution is the interpretation, not the architecture. They feel there's little novelty and the experiments are straightforward given existing methods. Their technical novelty is 2, empirical 1, so a strong rejection.\n\nReviewer 7: Thinks it's an incremental improvement over NCA. The damage experiments are interesting but could be better showcased. They want more comparisons and analysis of where VNCA excels. Correctness is 3 (minor issues), technical novelty 3, empirical 2. So a borderline accept but with reservations.\n\nNow, compiling all this. The key points for acceptance are:\n\n- The paper is well-written and clear (multiple reviewers noted this).\n- It's a step towards making NCAs more generalizable (Reviewer 5's point).\n- The robustness to perturbations is a novel contribution (though some reviewers question its practicality).\n- The authors addressed many concerns in the rebuttal, leading some reviewers to raise their scores.\n\nPoints against:\n\n- Performance is significantly below state-of-the-art (especially on CelebA). Reviewers 1,4,6 note this.\n- Technical novelty is questioned. Reviewer 6 says it's just a reinterpreted conv net, and Reviewer 2 points out prior work on weight-sharing.\n- Some reviewers feel the motivation isn't strong enough (Reviewer 4's point about what problem it solves).\n- The experiments are underwhelming except on MNIST, and the need for averaging samples is a downside.\n\nThe conference standards are top-tier, so the work needs to be novel and impactful. The VNCA's main contributions are the variational framework applied to NCAs and the self-organizing robustness. However, the technical novelty is marginal according to some reviewers. The empirical results are decent but not groundbreaking, and the paper's main selling points (robustness, self-organization) might not be seen as practically significant enough.\n\nThe split among reviewers is notable. Reviewers 3,5,7 lean towards accept (with 5 and 7 raising their scores post-rebuttal), while 1,2,4,6 are more negative. The key is whether the contributions, despite the performance gap, are sufficiently novel and impactful for a top conference.\n\nConsidering that some reviewers (like 5) see it as a valuable addition to the NCA field, and the paper is well-written and honest, but others (like 6) think it's not novel enough. The conference might prioritize novel ideas even if they're not the best in performance, especially in emerging areas like NCAs. However, if the technical novelty is too low, it might not meet the bar.\n\nThe authors addressed some concerns (like architecture details, prior work), which helped some reviewers. The robustness aspect, while maybe not practically useful, is an interesting property. The paper's honesty about shortcomings is a plus.\n\nIn the end, the borderline cases often depend on the balance between novelty and impact. Since the technical novelty is rated low by some, but others see it as a meaningful step in the NCA space, and the paper is well-executed, I think it's a marginal accept. However, top-tier conferences might require higher novelty. But given that some reviewers raised their scores to accept after rebuttal, and the paper does contribute to the field, I'm leaning towards accept.\n</think>\n\nThe paper proposes the Variational Neural Cellular Automata (VNCA), a generative model inspired by biological cellular processes. While the VNCA shows promise in self-organization and robustness to perturbations, its performance lags behind state-of-the-art methods, and its technical novelty is debated. Key points include:\n\n### Strengths:\n1. **Clarity and Reproducibility**: The paper is well-written, transparent about limitations, and reproducible (noted by multiple reviewers).\n2. **Novelty in NCA Context**: It advances the use of NCAs in generative modeling, addressing a gap in generalizing NCAs beyond single-image generation (Reviewer 5).\n3. **Robustness**: The self-organizing property and resilience to early-stage perturbations are unique contributions, even if their practical utility is questioned.\n4. **Rebuttal Improvements**: Addressing architectural details, prior work, and hyperparameters strengthened the paper, leading some reviewers to raise their scores to \"accept.\"\n\n### Weaknesses:\n1. **Performance Gaps**: Likelihoods and sample quality are significantly below state-of-the-art on datasets like CelebA (Reviewers 1, 4, 6).\n2. **Technical Novelty**: Critics argue the decoder architecture is a reinterpretation of existing convolutional networks (e.g., weight-shared ResNets or neural ODEs), reducing its novelty (Reviewers 2, 6).\n3. **Motivation and Impact**: The paper’s practical significance is unclear, and the problem it solves (e.g., generalizing NCAs) is seen as incremental (Reviewer 4).\n4. **Empirical Limitations**: Results are underwhelming except on MNIST, and sample quality requires averaging (Reviewer 1).\n\n### Balancing the Arguments:\n- **Pro-Accept**: The VNCA contributes to an emerging area (NCAs) with theoretical insights into self-organization and robustness. The paper’s honesty and clarity are commendable, and the rebuttal addressed key concerns.\n- **Pro-Reject**: The technical novelty is marginal, and the performance gap undermines its practical relevance. The work does not sufficiently distinguish itself from prior art (e.g., neural ODEs, weight-shared networks).\n\n### Final Decision:\nThe paper’s contributions, while valuable in the niche of NCA-based generative models, fall short of the technical novelty and empirical impact expected at a top-tier conference. While improvements in the rebuttal helped, the lack of clear practical utility and the performance gap outweigh its strengths. \n\n**Final Decision: Reject**"

      "response": "Okay, let's tackle this. I need to decide whether to accept or reject this paper for a top-tier conference. Let me start by going through all the information provided.\n\nThe paper's title and abstract suggest it's about overparameterization in recursive value estimation for RL, specifically looking at TD, FVI, and RM. The key contributions seem to be analyzing how these algorithms behave in overparameterized linear settings, showing they converge to different fixed points, and proposing regularizers for deep models based on their findings. The experiments show improved stability and performance with these regularizers.\n\nNow, looking at the reviewer comments. There are 10 reviewers, so I'll need to synthesize their feedback. Let me go through each one:\n\nReviewer 1 and 4 are positive, just thanking the authors. Reviewer 2 wants more credit to existing work and to tone down claims about deep RL. Reviewer 3 points out that a solution (equation 71) is already known and that the connection to deep RL (with not very wide networks) is an issue. Reviewer 6 has technical concerns about matrix decomposition assumptions and suggests more empirical/theoretical work. They also question the generalization error bound's behavior. Reviewer 7 is excited but notes lack of scholarship (not citing prior work), triviality of some theorems, and issues in proofs. They also question the connection to deep RL since deep models use more than just last-layer overparameterization. Experiments are seen as weak. Reviewer 8 is positive but concerned about the iid data assumption and experiments in simple environments. Reviewer 9 is critical, pointing out errors in equations, incorrect proofs, and lack of comparison between over/underparameterized cases. They also question the use of linear models for overparameterization. Reviewer 10 thinks the linear case is too restrictive and the technical contributions aren't novel enough, though the problem is interesting.\n\nSo, the main points of contention are:\n\n1. **Lack of Proper Credit to Prior Work**: Reviewers 2, 3, 7, and 9 mention that some results (like Theorem 4 being the minimum norm solution) are not properly cited. This could undermine the novelty.\n\n2. **Connection to Deep RL**: Multiple reviewers (3,7,9,10) question how the linear overparameterization analysis translates to deep networks, which are more complex. The paper's experiments might not sufficiently bridge this gap.\n\n3. **Technical Errors and Clarity**: Reviewer 9 points out specific errors in equations and proofs (like equation 38, 42, and the Hoeffding application). Reviewer 6 and 7 also note issues in proofs and matrix assumptions. These need to be fixed but might not be deal-breakers if addressed.\n\n4. **Empirical Weaknesses**: Reviewers 7 and 8 mention that experiments are on toy environments and figures are unclear. The empirical contribution is seen as marginal.\n\n5. **Theoretical Contributions**: While the analysis is novel in the linear overparameterized setting, some reviewers (like 10) feel it's too restrictive and not impactful enough. The paper's significance hinges on whether the insights are transferable or foundational.\n\n6. **Overparameterization Context**: Reviewer 9 and 10 note that overparameterization in deep models isn't just a linear case but involves deeper architectures. The paper's focus on linear might be seen as limited.\n\nOn the positive side, the paper provides a novel analysis of fixed points in overparameterized linear settings, unifying different algorithms under a norm-minimization framework. The regularizers proposed show empirical improvements, which is a practical contribution. Reviewers 7 and 8 acknowledge the theoretical interest, and some (like Reviewer 7 post-rebuttal) lean towards acceptance.\n\nHowever, the critical issues are the lack of proper citations, potential technical errors, and the disconnect between linear analysis and deep RL applications. The paper might need significant revisions to address these, but since it's a conference submission, the question is whether the contributions are sufficient despite these flaws.\n\nTop-tier conferences require high novelty, correctness, and impact. The theoretical analysis is a step forward but may be incremental if prior work isn't acknowledged. The empirical part is weak, and the deep RL connection is tenuous. The errors in proofs and equations are concerning but might be fixable in the camera-ready.\n\nConsidering all, the paper has merit but needs substantial revisions. However, some reviewers (like 7 and 8) are on the fence. Since the reviewers' scores (especially technical novelty and empirical scores being 2-3) suggest it's borderline. The key is whether the contributions are significant enough. The analysis in overparameterized linear settings is novel but perhaps not groundbreaking for a top conference. The regularizers are a nice addition but not transformative.\n\nFinal call: The paper has some good ideas but lacks sufficient novelty, proper scholarship, and empirical validation. The technical issues need fixing, but the core contributions might not meet the high bar of a top-tier conference. However, since some reviewers are leaning towards acceptance and the problem is recognized as important, maybe it's a marginal accept. Wait, but the technical novelty scores are mostly 2-3, which for top conferences might be a reject. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking at the scores: Reviewer 7 gave technical novelty 3 (significant and somewhat new), but others like 9 and 10 gave 2. The empirical scores are low. The correctness has some issues (reviewer 9 gave 2). For a top conference, the technical novelty needs to be higher. Since the main contribution is analyzing overparameterized linear models, which might be seen as not impactful enough compared to existing work in deep RL overparameterization (like NTK etc.), and the paper doesn't address that, it might not be a strong enough contribution. The reviewers' mixed but mostly cautious support might push towards a reject, but some are on the edge. However, the repeated issues about prior work and technical errors could tip it over. \n\nAlternatively, if the authors can address the citations and errors, maybe it's acceptable. But as a reviewer, I have to decide based on current submission. Since the paper's main contributions are somewhat incremental and the deep RL connection is weak, and there are unresolved technical issues, I think it's better to reject. But some reviewers are for acceptance. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking at the final scores from reviewers:\n\n- Reviewer 7: technical novelty 3, empirical 1. Correctness 4. So overall, they like it but empirical is weak.\n\n- Reviewer 8: technical 3, empirical 2, correctness 3.\n\n- Reviewer 9: technical 2, empirical 2, correctness 2.\n\n- Reviewer 10: technical 2, empirical 2, correctness 3.\n\nThe average technical novelty is around 2.5, which for a top conference might be insufficient. The empirical contributions are weak. The theoretical part is novel but perhaps not transformative. The lack of proper citations (as per reviewers) is a red flag. The errors in proofs need fixing, but that's part of the rebuttal process. However, since the decision is based on current submission, the existing errors and lack of scholarship might be enough to reject.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject. The paper has some interesting ideas but suffers from insufficient novelty compared to prior work, technical errors, and a weak connection to deep RL applications. While the analysis is novel in the linear overparameterized setting, the contributions may not meet the high standards of a top-tier conference without significant revisions, which can't be guaranteed here.\n</think>\n\nFinal Decision: Reject\n\n**Detailed Reasoning:**\n\n1. **Lack of Proper Credit to Prior Work:** Multiple reviewers (2, 3, 7, 9) highlighted that key results (e.g., Theorem 4, Equation 71) were not adequately cited or acknowledged. This undermines the paper’s novelty and scholarship, which is critical for a top-tier conference.\n\n2. **Technical Errors and Clarity Issues:** Reviewers 6, 7, and 9 identified specific errors in proofs (e.g., incorrect application of Hoeffding’s inequality, flawed matrix decomposition assumptions), equations (e.g., Equation 38, 42), and unclear explanations. While some of these could be addressed in revisions, their presence in the current submission raises concerns about the rigor of the analysis.\n\n3. **Empirical Weaknesses:** The experiments were criticized as being on toy environments with unclear motivation (Reviewer 7) and small figures (Reviewer 7, 10). The empirical contributions are marginal, and the proposed regularizers’ effectiveness in complex, real-world settings remains untested.\n\n4. **Limited Connection to Deep RL:** Reviewers 3, 7, 9, and 10 questioned the relevance of the linear overparameterization analysis to deep RL, where overparameterization involves more complex architectures (e.g., neural networks). The paper’s focus on linear models and lack of deeper theoretical or empirical exploration of nonlinear extensions limits its practical impact.\n\n5. **Theoretical Novelty and Significance:** While the analysis of fixed points and norm-minimization in overparameterized linear settings is novel, reviewers (e.g., 10) noted that the contributions are incremental compared to existing work in RL theory. The lack of a clear comparison between overparameterized and underparameterized regimes (noted by Reviewer 9) further weakens the significance.\n\n6. **Overparameterization Context:** The paper’s focus on linear models may not align with the broader context of overparameterization in deep learning (e.g., neural tangent kernel theory), which reviewers (e.g., 10) argued is more relevant to modern practice. This disconnect reduces the paper’s broader impact.\n\n**Conclusion:** While the paper addresses an important theoretical question and proposes practical regularizers, its shortcomings in scholarship, technical rigor, empirical validation, and alignment with deep RL practice outweigh its contributions. The contributions, though valid, are insufficiently novel or impactful for a top-tier conference without substantial revisions, which cannot be guaranteed based on the current submission."

I need to go through all the provided information carefully.\n\nStarting with the paper's abstract. The title is \"Enriching Online Knowledge Distillation with Specialist Ensemble.\" The keywords are online KD, label prior shift, and ensemble learning. The abstract mentions that they're addressing diversity in teacher ensembles by using label prior shifts and importance sampling, then aggregating with post-compensation. They claim improvements in error rates and calibration.\n\nNow, looking at the reviewer comments. There are five reviewers. Let's go through each one.\n\nReviewer 1 points out some strengths but also several weaknesses. The main issues are that the setup is too specialized (online and peer networks), unclear baselines, lack of ablations (like testing PC-Softmax or importance sampling against alternatives), and the aggregation method might be naive. They also question why the technique is specific to online KD. The reviewer thinks the method combines existing ideas without clear justification and suggests more ablations. The technical and empirical novelty are rated 2 (marginal), and correctness is 3 (minor issues).\n\nReviewer 2 is more critical. They mention that the results for MVCL (a baseline) don't match the original paper, possibly due to rushed reproduction. They also think the method isn't novel enough, agreeing with another reviewer (Xcq2). They recommend rejection because the paper isn't ready for a top conference.\n\nReviewer 3 is more positive. They acknowledge the framework's novelty in combining specialists with online KD, despite component ideas existing before. They note thorough experiments but point out typos. Their technical novelty is 2, empirical is 3. Correctness is 4, which is good, but still low novelty.\n\nReviewer 4 says the paper is well-written but lacks comparisons with recent methods like CGL, PCL, and L-MCL. The performance improvements are small, especially on ImageNet (0.05% over PCL). They also note that error rates are used instead of accuracy, making comparisons harder. They want more experiments but would raise their score if done. Correctness is 3, novelty 2.\n\nReviewer 5 is critical about experiments. They point out that the proposed method doesn't beat existing methods like PCL on CIFAR and another method [1] which is better. They question the novelty since label prior shift and sampling are existing ideas. They also mention missing comparisons. Correctness is 1 (claims not supported), novelty 2.\n\nSo, compiling the key points:\n\nStrengths:\n- Clear motivation and structure (Reviewers 3, 5)\n- Thorough ablation studies (Reviewers 1, 3)\n- Improved calibration and some performance gains (Abstract, Reviewer 3)\n- Novelty in combining components for online KD (Reviewer 3)\n\nWeaknesses:\n- Limited novelty: reviewers 1,2,4,5 say it's a combination of existing techniques without enough new contribution.\n- Inadequate baselines: especially not comparing with recent methods like L-MCL, CGL, PCL on all datasets. The results vs PCL are marginal (0.05% on ImageNet).\n- Experimental issues: MVCL results inconsistent, not using accuracy for easier comparison, missing key baselines.\n- Technical aspects: aggregation method might be naive, importance sampling vs other methods not tested, unclear why online KD specifically benefits.\n- Writing issues: typos, some explanations missing (like why label shift here is different from prior work).\n\nThe main concerns are novelty and experimental rigor. Top conferences require significant contributions. While the paper has some improvements, the reviewers (especially 2,4,5) argue that the method isn't novel enough and the experiments don't convincingly show superiority over recent methods. The technical novelty is rated low across the board (mostly 2s). The empirical results are marginal, and there are issues with baseline comparisons.\n\nThe reviewers suggest that more ablations and better experiments could help, but given the current state, especially the lack of strong results against recent works and the incremental nature, it's likely not meeting the bar for a top-tier conference. The fact that Reviewer 5 gave correctness a 1 is a red flag, though others were higher. However, multiple reviewers point to insufficient novelty and experiments.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject\n</think>\n\nThe paper proposes a framework for online knowledge distillation that introduces label prior shifts to create diverse teacher ensembles and employs post-compensation aggregation. While the method shows some improvements in performance metrics like calibration and error rates, several critical issues undermine its suitability for a top-tier conference:\n\n1. **Novelty Concerns**: Multiple reviewers (1, 2, 4, 5) highlight that the contributions are incremental, combining existing techniques (e.g., label prior shifts, importance sampling, PC-Softmax) without sufficient justification for their specific combination or novel insights. The framework’s novelty is deemed marginal, even when applied to online KD.\n\n2. **Experimental Weaknesses**: \n   - **Incomplete Baselines**: Key recent methods like L-MCL, CGL, and PCL are not adequately compared, especially on CIFAR datasets. The reported improvement over PCL on ImageNet (0.05%) is minimal and may not justify the proposed approach’s complexity.\n   - **Reproducibility Issues**: Reviewer 2 notes discrepancies in MVCL results compared to the original work, suggesting potential flaws in experimental setup or execution.\n   - **Metric Choice**: Using error rates instead of accuracy complicates comparisons with other works, and the lack of clear motivation for this choice weakens the empirical analysis.\n\n3. **Technical Gaps**: \n   - The aggregation method (simple averaging) is criticized as naive, ignoring label-specific expertise of teachers. The paper does not explore weighted averaging or other strategies to leverage teacher specialization.\n   - Importance sampling is used without ablation studies comparing it to alternative methods (e.g., data resampling), leaving its necessity unproven.\n   - The claim that the approach is specific to online KD is unconvincing, as reviewers question its applicability to offline settings.\n\n4. **Clarity and Writing**: While the paper is generally clear, typos and missing explanations (e.g., differences from prior work on label shifts) detract from its quality. The lack of a detailed discussion on why the proposed method outperforms calibration metrics (e.g., \"notably expected calibration error\") further weakens the narrative.\n\n5. **Reviewer Consensus**: Despite some positive remarks on structure and experiments (Reviewers 3, 5), the majority of reviewers (1, 2, 4, 5) emphasize insufficient novelty, weak empirical validation, and technical gaps. Reviewer 5 even rates correctness as 1 (\"claims not supported\"), though others are more lenient. The consensus leans toward rejection due to the lack of breakthrough contributions and rigorous experimental validation.\n\n**Final Decision: Reject**"

      "response": "Okay, let's tackle this. The paper is about a new contrastive learning objective to reduce text degeneration in language models. The reviewers have mixed but mostly critical feedback. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the title and abstract mention that the paper addresses the problem of text degeneration, which is a known issue with cross-entropy training. They propose a contrastive approach that builds on unlikelihood training (UL) but claims to improve upon it by explicitly considering the relationship between label and negative tokens. The key idea is to suppress negative tokens (repetitions) while promoting positives.\n\nLooking at the reviewer comments, there's a consensus on some points. Reviewer 1 points out that the novelty is thin because UL already penalizes negative tokens, and the paper might be misrepresenting UL's approach. The reviewer also criticizes the experiments for being insufficient, not testing on more tasks like MT or summarization, and relying on perplexity which might not be the best metric. \n\nReviewer 2 agrees the method is simple and shows some improvements but flags the experimental setup as weak. They mention using GPT2-small and outdated models, which might not be representative. Also, the metrics used (like dist-1 instead of higher n-grams) and the interpretation of perplexity are problematic since lower perplexity can sometimes indicate degenerate behavior. The decoding methods (beam search vs. sampling) are also unclear, and some baselines like typical sampling are missing.\n\nReviewer 3 says the idea is similar to UL and lacks novelty. They acknowledge the experiments and human eval but stress the lack of new contributions. \n\nReviewer 4 notes the method is well-motivated but questions the choice of using M previous tokens instead of all (as in UL). They also point out that human evaluations didn't show statistical significance over UL-TS, conflicting with claims of better fluency. Additionally, experiments on larger models are missing, which might be crucial since bigger models often handle repetition better without such techniques.\n\nSo, the main issues are:\n\n1. **Novelty Concerns**: Multiple reviewers (1,2,3,4) state that the contribution is incremental over UL. The core idea of penalizing negative tokens isn't new, and the paper might not sufficiently differentiate itself. The authors' claim that UL doesn't consider label and negative relationships is disputed by Reviewer 1, who argues UL does both likelihood and unlikelihood terms.\n\n2. **Experimental Weaknesses**: \n   - Limited model sizes (GPT2-small) and tasks (only language modeling and dialogue, not MT/summarization as mentioned in the abstract).\n   - Metrics like perplexity might be misleading. The use of dist-1 instead of higher n-grams is criticized.\n   - Missing baselines (e.g., typical sampling) and unclear decoding methods (beam search vs. sampling).\n   - Human evaluations didn't show significance over some baselines, conflicting with claims.\n\n3. **Technical Soundness**: Reviewer 1's point about misrepresenting UL's equations could be a factual error, which undermines the paper's foundation. If the authors misrepresented prior work, that's a serious issue.\n\n4. **Relevance to Top-tier Conference**: The method's marginal gains and lack of broader validation (on more tasks, larger models) might not meet the high bar for a top conference like ICLR. The simplicity of the approach needs to be offset by strong empirical results or novel insights, which the reviewers feel are lacking.\n\nOn the positive side, the paper is clear and reproducible, and the idea is intuitive. The experiments do show some improvements, but the reviewers argue these aren't sufficient given the existing baselines and the method's incremental nature.\n\nConsidering all this, the main barriers are the lack of novelty and insufficient experiments. Even if the method works better, if it's just a minor tweak on UL without clear evidence of superiority across diverse settings, especially on larger models, it might not be a strong enough contribution. The misrepresentation of prior work (if true) adds another layer of concern. \n\nThe reviewers' scores lean towards rejection, with most giving technical and empirical significance as 2 or 3 (marginal). The consensus seems to be that while the paper is well-written, it doesn't meet the novelty or rigor required for a top conference.\n</think>\n\nThe paper proposes a contrastive learning objective to address text degeneration in language models, building on prior work like unlikelihood training (UL). While the method is clear and shows some improvements, several critical issues undermine its suitability for a top-tier conference:\n\n### Key Concerns:\n1. **Novelty Deficit**:  \n   - Multiple reviewers (1, 3, 4) highlight that the core idea of penalizing negative tokens is not novel, as UL already incorporates similar principles. The authors’ claim that UL does not jointly consider label and negative tokens is disputed (Reviewer 1), suggesting potential misrepresentation of prior work.  \n   - The proposed method’s distinction from UL (e.g., using M previous tokens vs. all tokens) is under-explored, with no ablation studies to clarify its impact (Reviewer 4).  \n\n2. **Experimental Limitations**:  \n   - **Model and Task Scope**: Experiments focus on small models (GPT2-small) and limited tasks (language modeling, dialogue), despite claims of broader applicability (e.g., MT, summarization). This undermines generalizability.  \n   - **Metric Choice**: Overreliance on perplexity and dist-1 metrics is criticized. Lower perplexity can signal degenerate behavior in LMs (Reviewer 2), and higher n-gram diversity metrics (dist-2/3/4) are standard but omitted.  \n   - **Missing Baselines**: Key decoding methods (e.g., typical sampling) and stronger baselines (e.g., UL with M tokens) are absent, weakening comparisons. Human evaluations lack statistical significance against some baselines (Reviewer 4).  \n\n3. **Technical Soundness**:  \n   - Reviewer 1’s critique of the authors’ misrepresentation of UL’s formulation raises concerns about the paper’s factual accuracy, which could invalidate its foundational claims.  \n   - The choice of beam search over sampling methods is unclear, and the decoding strategy’s impact on results is not analyzed (Reviewer 2).  \n\n4. **Relevance to Top-tier Standards**:  \n   - While the method is simple and reproducible, its marginal gains over UL and limited validation on modern, large-scale models (e.g., GPT-3) suggest it does not meet the high bar for innovation or impact expected at a top conference.  \n\n### Conclusion:  \nThe paper’s incremental contribution, coupled with insufficient experiments and unresolved issues regarding prior work, weakens its case for acceptance. The method’s modest improvements and lack of rigorous validation across diverse settings and larger models fail to justify publication at a top-tier venue.  \n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

      "response": "Okay, let's tackle this. I need to decide whether to accept or reject this paper for a top-tier conference. Let me start by going through all the information provided.\n\nThe paper is about epoch-wise double descent in neural networks, focusing on a linear teacher-student model. The authors use replica theory to derive analytical expressions for generalization error over training time. They attribute double descent to different features being learned at different speeds, with fast features overfitting before slower ones kick in. They validate this with experiments on ResNet18 and CIFAR10.\n\nLooking at the reviewers' comments. Reviewer 1 is positive, saying it's a valuable contribution, clearly written, and the theory is well-motivated. They point out some areas for deeper exploration, like features with more than two scales, differences between epoch-wise and model-size double descent, and the peak's interpretation. They also mention a color code issue in Figure 2. Correctness is rated 4 (all claims well-supported), technical and empirical significance 3 (significant but some prior work exists).\n\nReviewer 2 is more critical. They note connections to prior work on implicit regularization in linear models (like Ali and Tibshirani's work on GD/SGD as ridge regularization) and HDLSS settings (high-dimensional, low-sample-size). They think the authors should discuss these connections more. Correctness is 3 (minor issues), and significance also 3, similar to Reviewer 1 but maybe less enthusiastic.\n\nReviewer 3 has more detailed concerns. They mention numerous typos and unclear parts in the math, which could affect the correctness assessment. They question the technical novelty, suggesting that the idea of multiple scales might not be new (citing Heckel & Yilmaz, Stephenson & Lee). They also point out that the student-teacher model's connection to real DNNs isn't fully explored. The abstract mentions random matrix theory, but the reviewer couldn't find where that's applied. The typos and unclear derivations in equations (like Eq. 5, 8, 20, etc.) are problematic. Correctness is 3, technical significance 2 (marginal), and empirical significance 2 as well.\n\nSo, the main points to consider are:\n\n1. **Novelty and Significance**: Reviewers 1 and 2 think it's significant but with some prior work. Reviewer 3 is more skeptical about novelty, pointing to existing works on multi-scale features and implicit regularization. The authors need to better distinguish their contributions from prior art.\n\n2. **Technical Soundness**: Reviewer 1 is confident, but Reviewers 2 and 3 note issues. Reviewer 3's detailed comments about typos and unclear derivations are concerning. If the math has errors or is hard to follow, that's a problem for a top conference.\n\n3. **Connections to Prior Work**: Reviewers 2 and 3 stress the need for better discussion of related work, especially on implicit regularization and HDLSS. The authors didn't sufficiently address these, which might weaken their contribution's originality.\n\n4. **Clarity and Presentation**: Reviewer 3's comments about typos and confusing parts are important. A top-tier paper needs to be well-written and clear, especially in technical derivations.\n\n5. **Empirical Validation**: The experiments with ResNet18 and CIFAR10 are a plus, but Reviewer 3 points out that the connection to real DNNs isn't fully made. The authors might need to better explain how their linear model's insights apply to deeper networks.\n\nPossible acceptance if the authors can address the typos, clarify the math, and better situate their work within existing literature. However, if the technical issues are too severe or the novelty is indeed marginal, it might be rejected.\n\nThe key is whether the contributions are significant enough despite existing work. Since Reviewer 1 is positive and others have minor/major concerns but not outright flaws, maybe it's a borderline case. But top conferences require high novelty and clarity. The fact that Reviewer 3 found the technical parts hard to follow due to typos and unclear explanations might push towards rejection unless those can be fixed. However, since this is a review decision based on the provided info, and the authors can't revise yet, the reviewers' scores matter.\n\nLooking at the scores: Reviewer 1 gave technical and empirical significance 3, Reviewer 2 same, but Reviewer 3 gave 2. The average might be around 2.5-3. The correctness scores are 4, 3, 3. The main issues are the novelty and clarity. Since two reviewers think it's somewhat new and significant, but one thinks it's marginal, and there are technical presentation issues, it's a tough call.\n\nBut top conferences often require high novelty. If the core idea of multi-scale features in epoch-wise double descent isn't novel (as per Reviewer 3's points about prior works), then it might not meet the bar. However, the authors' analysis in a linear model with analytical results could still be a contribution if framed properly. The reviewers' suggestions for improvements (discussing connections, fixing typos) are actionable, but the decision is whether the paper is acceptable as is.\n\nGiven that two reviewers (1 and 2) think it's a solid contribution with room for improvement, and one (3) is more critical but not entirely dismissive, perhaps the paper should be accepted with the expectation that the authors address the typos, clarify the math, and better discuss prior work. Since the final decision is based on the current submission, but the reviewers' scores are mostly in the 3 range (except Reviewer 3's technical significance 2), maybe it's a borderline accept. However, top conferences might lean towards rejecting if the novelty is marginal and there are clarity issues.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the main contribution is the analytical framework for epoch-wise double descent in a linear model, which hasn't been done before, and the experiments validate it, maybe it's worth accepting. The typos and minor technical issues can be fixed in the camera-ready version. The key is whether the core idea is novel and correct. Since Reviewer 1 and 2 think it's correct and valuable, and Reviewer 3's main issues are about presentation and prior work discussion, which can be addressed, perhaps it should be accepted.\n</think>\n\nThe paper presents an analysis of epoch-wise double descent in a linear teacher-student framework, deriving closed-form expressions for generalization error dynamics using replica theory. It attributes the phenomenon to multi-scale feature learning, where fast features overfit before slower features improve performance. While the work is theoretically grounded and validated empirically, several critical factors influence its suitability for a top-tier conference:\n\n### Key Strengths:\n1. **Theoretical Contribution**: The paper provides a novel analytical framework for understanding epoch-wise double descent in a simplified linear model, offering insights into how feature learning scales influence generalization dynamics. This is a non-trivial extension of prior work on double descent, particularly in the context of training time.\n2. **Empirical Validation**: The alignment between theoretical predictions and experiments on ResNet18 and CIFAR10 suggests the mechanisms identified may generalize to deep networks, enhancing the work’s relevance.\n3. **Clarity and Motivation**: Reviewer 1 praises the clear writing and well-motivated theory, which are essential for a top-tier submission.\n\n### Key Weaknesses:\n1. **Novelty Concerns**: \n   - Reviewer 3 highlights that the core idea of multi-scale features (e.g., high/low SNR features) and connections to implicit regularization (e.g., Ali & Tibshirani, Heckel & Yilmaz) may overlap with prior work. The authors could better distinguish their contributions by explicitly addressing these connections.\n   - The technical novelty is rated as \"marginal\" by Reviewer 3, suggesting the work may not sufficiently advance the field beyond existing studies on double descent in simpler models.\n2. **Technical Soundness and Presentation**:\n   - Reviewer 3 raises significant concerns about typos, unclear derivations (e.g., equations 5, 8, 20), and the lack of explicit use of random matrix theory as claimed in the abstract. These issues could obscure the correctness of the analysis, even if the final results are valid.\n   - The disconnect between the student-teacher model and real DNNs (e.g., how label noise creates multi-scale features) weakens the practical relevance.\n3. **Discussion of Prior Work**:\n   - Reviewers 2 and 3 emphasize the need for deeper engagement with related work on implicit regularization (e.g., SGD as ridge regularization) and high-dimensional settings (HDLSS). The current submission does not adequately contextualize its contributions within this literature.\n\n### Final Assessment:\nWhile the paper addresses an important problem and offers valuable theoretical insights, its marginal novelty and technical presentation issues—particularly the lack of clarity in derivations and insufficient discussion of prior work—limit its impact at a top-tier conference. The core idea of multi-scale feature learning is not entirely novel, and the typos and ambiguities in the mathematical exposition raise concerns about rigor. However, the work’s potential to inspire further research and its empirical validation suggest it could be strengthened with revisions. \n\n### Final Decision: Reject\n\nThe decision hinges on the need for higher novelty and technical polish to meet the standards of a top-tier venue. The authors should address the reviewers' critiques (e.g., typos, prior work connections, and clarity of derivations) before resubmitting to a more specialized venue or journal."

      "response": "Okay, let's tackle this. The paper is about improving adversarial robustness through a new adversarial training algorithm called ARoW. The main idea is applying more regularization to samples that are less robust. The theoretical contribution is a new upper bound on the robust risk, and experiments show it's better than existing methods.\n\nLooking at the reviewers' comments, there's a mix of positive and critical feedback. Some reviewers (like Reviewer 2, 6, 7, 14, 15) are supportive, pointing out the empirical improvements and theoretical grounding. However, several others (Reviewers 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16) have serious concerns about the theoretical contributions. \n\nThe key issues raised are about the novelty and validity of Theorem 1. Reviewers 5, 9, 16 argue that the theorem is just a rephrasing of existing work (TRADES) extended to multi-class, which they see as not a significant theoretical contribution. They also point out that the bound might be loose and not tightly connected to the practical implementation. The definition of z(x) is confusing and not rigorously defined, leading to mathematical inconsistencies. \n\nOn the empirical side, while some reviewers acknowledge the improvements, others (like Reviewer 8 and 15) note that the gains over baselines like HAT are marginal, especially when using extra data. There are also concerns about whether the baselines were properly tuned, as some results don't match previous reports. \n\nThe authors tried to address these in rebuttals, but the theoretical concerns remain unresolved. Reviewers 7 and 8 suggest that the theorem's simplicity might have value, but others like 5 and 9 are unconvinced. The practical vs. theoretical discrepancies (like the use of KL divergence vs. the theoretical indicator function) are problematic because they weaken the claim that the method is grounded in the theory.\n\nThe experiments, while showing some improvement, are on smaller datasets (CIFAR10, etc.), and there's no evidence on larger datasets. The marginal gains and the unresolved theoretical issues are significant drawbacks for a top-tier conference, which usually requires strong contributions in both theory and practice.\n\nConsidering all this, the paper's theoretical novelty is questionable, and the empirical improvements are small. The lack of rigorous mathematical definitions and the potential looseness of the bounds undermine the theoretical claims. While the method might be an incremental improvement, the criticisms from multiple reviewers about the core contributions are substantial. Therefore, it's probably better to reject unless the authors can significantly address these points, which they haven't done yet based on the provided feedback.\n</think>\n\nThe paper proposes a novel adversarial training method (ARoW) that aims to improve robustness by applying stronger regularization to less robust samples. While the method shows marginal empirical improvements over existing baselines in some scenarios, the theoretical contributions face significant criticism. Key issues include:\n\n1. **Theoretical Contributions**:  \n   - **Novelty and Rigor**: Multiple reviewers (5, 9, 16) argue that Theorem 1 is a trivial extension of TRADES' bound to multi-class classification, lacking sufficient theoretical novelty. The derivation is seen as a rephrasing of existing work rather than a meaningful advancement.  \n   - **Loose Bounds**: The theoretical framework relies on loose bounds (e.g., replacing indicator functions with KL-divergence-based approximations), which reviewers (5, 9, 16) claim disconnect the theory from the practical implementation. The definition of \\( z(x) \\) is mathematically ambiguous, leading to inconsistencies between the theoretical claims and the algorithm.  \n   - **Lack of Clear Justification**: Reviewers (10, 11, 12) highlight unresolved ambiguities in the mathematical definitions (e.g., non-rigorous handling of \\( z(x) \\)), undermining the theoretical soundness.\n\n2. **Empirical Contributions**:  \n   - **Marginal Gains**: While ARoW outperforms some baselines, the improvements are small (e.g., comparable to HAT in most setups). Reviewer 8 notes that with extra data, the differences vanish, weakening the method's practical significance.  \n   - **Baseline Comparisons**: Concerns about suboptimal baseline tuning (e.g., HAT results not matching prior reports) and limited dataset scope (small-scale datasets like CIFAR-10) reduce confidence in the results.  \n\n3. **Clarity and Reproducibility**:  \n   - The paper is well-written, but the theoretical sections suffer from ambiguous notation and insufficient rigor, as noted by multiple reviewers (10, 11, 12).  \n\n**Conclusion**: While the paper addresses an important problem and shows incremental empirical improvements, the theoretical contributions are insufficiently novel and rigorously grounded. The unresolved ambiguities in the mathematical framework and the marginal practical gains relative to existing methods fall short of the high bar for a top-tier conference.  \n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

      "response": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate whether this paper should be accepted or rejected for a top-tier conference. Let me start by going through all the provided information carefully.\n\nFirst, the paper's title is \"MCTransformer: Combining Transformers And Monte-Carlo Tree Search For Offline Reinforcement Learning.\" The abstract mentions combining MCTS with Transformers in an actor-critic setup, using the Transformer for exploration and evaluation of new states. They tested it on SameGame and claim it outperforms both Transformer-only and MCTS-only methods.\n\nNow, looking at the reviewer comments. There are three reviewers here. Let me parse each one.\n\nReviewer 1 points out several issues. The main strengths are the novel combination of DTs and MCTS, addressing exploration issues in DTs. But the weaknesses are significant: unclear writing, limited evaluation (only SameGame, no comparison to DTs or standard benchmarks like MiniGo or Atari). The MCTS baseline might be unfair because it doesn't use learned priors like in AlphaGo Zero. Clarity issues in figures and explanations. The reviewer thinks the paper isn't ready but has potential.\n\nReviewer 2 is more critical. They argue the method isn't novel, just replacing ResNet with Transformer in an AlphaZero-like setup. The experiments are unfair because MCTS without neural nets can do more simulations, and they didn't compare to other MCTS+NN methods. Also, the experiments are too limited to SameGame, and comparisons with random play aren't meaningful. They mention reproducibility issues since code isn't provided. The reviewer thinks the novelty is very low, similar to existing work.\n\nReviewer 3 also notes limited novelty, combining existing methods. They point out the experiments are not convincing: only SameGame, no comparison to prior SameGame works or other offline RL methods. They suggest standardized test sets and comparisons with other architectures. Clarity issues like typos and figure labels. The reviewer thinks the work is technically correct but lacks novelty and sufficient experiments.\n\nSo, the key points against acceptance are:\n\n1. **Novelty**: Reviewers 2 and 3 argue that the approach isn't novel. It's seen as a straightforward substitution of a Transformer in an existing MCTS framework (like AlphaZero), which isn't a significant contribution. The core idea isn't new enough for a top conference.\n\n2. **Empirical Evaluation**: All reviewers criticize the experiments. Only using SameGame, which is a single, possibly toy problem. Not comparing to relevant baselines like AlphaZero, Decision Transformers, or prior SameGame methods. The experiments might be unfair (e.g., MCTS without learned policies, comparing against random play). The lack of standard benchmarks weakens the claims.\n\n3. **Clarity and Presentation**: Reviewer 1 and 3 mention unclear writing, figures with small fonts, and missing explanations. While Reviewer 2 found it easy to follow, others had issues, which is a problem for reproducibility and understanding.\n\n4. **Technical Significance**: The contributions are seen as marginal. The method doesn't push the field forward significantly. The improvements over baselines might not be substantial enough given the setup.\n\nOn the positive side, Reviewer 1 acknowledges the idea's potential and originality, but the execution and presentation let it down. However, the other reviewers are more dismissive of the novelty.\n\nTop-tier conferences require high novelty, strong empirical validation, and clear presentation. Here, the paper's main innovation is questioned, the experiments are insufficient, and the writing has issues. Even if the idea has potential, as Reviewer 1 says, it's not ready yet. The lack of comparisons to key baselines and the narrow evaluation make it hard to justify acceptance. The reviewers' scores on technical and empirical significance are mostly low (1s and 2s), which is a red flag.\n\nTherefore, considering all factors, the paper should be rejected. It needs more substantial contributions, better experiments, and clearer presentation to meet the standards of a top conference.\n</think>\n\nThe paper proposes MCTransformer, a framework combining Transformers with MCTS for offline reinforcement learning. While the idea of integrating these components is novel in principle, the reviewers' critiques highlight critical shortcomings that undermine its suitability for a top-tier conference:\n\n### Key Issues:\n1. **Novelty and Originality**:\n   - **Weakness**: Reviewers 2 and 3 argue that the approach lacks novelty. The method is framed as a straightforward substitution of a Transformer for the neural network in an AlphaZero-like MCTS framework, which is not a significant departure from prior work (e.g., AlphaGo/AlphaZero). The core innovation is seen as incremental rather than groundbreaking.\n   - **Lack of Distinction**: The paper does not clearly differentiate itself from existing methods like Decision Transformers or MCTS-based systems with learned policies (e.g., MuZero). The reviewers question whether the combination of Transformers and MCTS adds meaningful technical or conceptual advances.\n\n2. **Empirical Evaluation**:\n   - **Limited Scope**: The experiments are confined to SameGame, a single, relatively simple and niche domain. This limits generalizability and makes it difficult to assess the method’s broader impact. Comparisons to standard benchmarks (e.g., MiniGo, Atari) or prior SameGame work (e.g., Schadd et al., Cazenave) are absent.\n   - **Unfair Baselines**: The MCTS baseline does not use learned policies or value functions (as in AlphaZero), making comparisons misleading. Additionally, experiments against a \"random player\" are trivial and uninformative. The paper also fails to compare against relevant baselines like Decision Transformers or offline RL methods.\n   - **Methodological Flaws**: The rollout policy’s design (e.g., whether it uses a heuristic or learned policy) is unclear, and the evaluation does not address computational efficiency fairly (e.g., comparing simulation counts vs. time limits).\n\n3. **Clarity and Presentation**:\n   - **Writing Quality**: Reviewer 1 emphasizes that the paper is poorly written, with unclear explanations, small figure fonts, and missing details (e.g., undefined terms like $rtg_\\pi(s_t)$). While Reviewer 2 found it \"easy to follow,\" others noted significant readability issues.\n   - **Reproducibility**: The lack of source code and incomplete experimental details (e.g., hyperparameters, training data) hinder reproducibility. The method’s similarity to AlphaZero does not excuse these gaps.\n\n4. **Technical and Empirical Significance**:\n   - **Marginal Contributions**: Reviewers 2 and 3 rate the technical and empirical significance as low (scores of 1 or 2). The improvements over baselines are not compelling given the narrow evaluation, and the method does not address fundamental challenges in offline RL or MCTS.\n\n### Counterarguments:\n- **Potential of the Idea**: Reviewer 1 acknowledges the idea’s promise but stresses that execution and presentation are lacking. However, top-tier conferences require both strong ideas *and* rigorous validation.\n- **SameGame as a Domain**: While SameGame is a well-studied problem, the paper does not leverage existing benchmarks or prior work in this domain, weakening its contribution even within this niche.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe paper’s lack of novelty, insufficient empirical validation, and poor presentation collectively disqualify it for acceptance at a top-tier conference. While the core idea has potential, the current submission fails to demonstrate its significance or rigor. Addressing these issues (e.g., expanding experiments, clarifying methodology, and comparing to stronger baselines) would be necessary for reconsideration.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

Let me start by going through all the provided information carefully.\n\nFirst, the paper's title is \"Detecting Out-of-Distribution Data with Semi-supervised Graph 'Feature' Networks.\" The abstract mentions using graph structures and topological properties to detect OOD data, achieving high AUROC scores on LSUN. The keywords are missing, which might be an oversight, but maybe not critical.\n\nLooking at the reviewer comments, there are four reviewers. Let me go through each one's points.\n\nReviewer 1 points out several weaknesses. The paper uses vague terms like \"common sense\" without clear definitions. The connection between the summary and the actual implementation isn't clear. They also mention that the authors compare their method to state-of-the-art by citing a reference but don't reproduce those methods for a fair comparison. There's a lack of analysis on how object detector accuracy affects the model, which is a big issue because OOD data can impact all models. Grammar issues and unclear figures (like Figure 1) are also mentioned. The reviewer suggests more detailed descriptions, better experiments, and clearer motivation. The correctness is rated 3 (minor issues), technical novelty 3 (somewhat new), empirical 2 (marginal).\n\nReviewer 2 is harsher. They say the paper is not well-prepared, with confusing notations (like inconsistent use of \"Near OOD\" vs. Table 1). The motivation and method aren't clearly described, making novelty hard to assess. They also note that the literature review is missing key surveys on OOD detection. The experiments are not convincing because they don't compare to state-of-the-art methods, only graph embedding techniques, and only use LSUN. The writing is poor, and the evaluation isn't extensive. The reviewer recommends a strong reject. Correctness is 1 (claims not supported), technical and empirical novelty both 1 (not novel or significant).\n\nReviewer 3 thinks the idea is interesting but lacks novelty since it combines existing methods. They mention the paper doesn't compare with state-of-the-art, which is a problem. The writing is unclear, especially about the object detection network's architecture and handling cases where the detector doesn't know the OOD classes. No ablation studies are present. Reproducibility is okay but analysis is lacking. They rate correctness 2 (some claims incorrect), novelty 2 (marginal).\n\nReviewer 4 sees some novelty in using semantic graphs for interpretable OOD detection but points out the method's reliance on a pre-trained object detector that might not cover all in-distribution data, especially in specialized domains like medical images. The experiments are insufficient: no comparison with other feature-based OOD methods, limited datasets (only LSUN), no ablation studies, and missing details on hyperparameters. The paper has many writing issues, like missing explanations and figures. Related work is poorly discussed, omitting key OOD detection approaches. They rate correctness 3, technical novelty 3, empirical 2, but overall says the paper isn't ready.\n\nNow, considering all this. The main issues across reviewers are:\n\n1. **Lack of comparison with state-of-the-art methods**: Multiple reviewers (1, 2, 3, 4) note that the authors didn't compare their method with current SOTA OOD detection techniques. They only compared with graph embedding methods, which isn't sufficient. For a top conference, this is a major flaw because without knowing how it stacks up against the best existing methods, the contribution's significance is unclear.\n\n2. **Poor writing and clarity**: Grammar issues, unclear figures, missing explanations (like in Figure 1), and inconsistent terminology (e.g., \"Near OOD\" vs. Table 1) make the paper hard to follow. The motivation and methodology aren't clearly connected, and some terms like \"common sense\" are vague. Reproducibility is hindered by insufficient details in the methods section.\n\n3. **Experimental limitations**: Only using LSUN dataset is a problem. Top-tier conferences usually expect experiments on multiple standard datasets. Also, no ablation studies to understand the method's components' contributions. The reliance on object detection models' accuracy isn't analyzed, which is critical because if the detector fails on OOD data, the method's performance could be compromised.\n\n4. **Novelty concerns**: While some reviewers see potential in the idea (like semantic graphs for interpretability), others argue it's just combining existing techniques (graph embeddings + OOD detection frameworks) without enough innovation. The technical novelty is marginal, and the empirical results don't show a significant improvement over SOTA when proper comparisons are made.\n\n5. **Literature review shortcomings**: Missing key references, especially in OOD detection surveys, suggests the authors didn't thoroughly engage with existing work. This is a red flag for a top conference where contributions must be placed in the broader context.\n\nOn the positive side, the idea of using graph structures for OOD detection is interesting, and the reported AUROC scores are high. However, without proper validation against SOTA and addressing the methodological flaws, these results aren't convincing. The potential for interpretability is noted, but the paper doesn't explore this adequately (e.g., no analysis of how the semantic graphs help in understanding OOD decisions).\n\nConsidering the standards of a top-tier conference, which require rigorous methodology, thorough experiments, clear writing, and significant contributions, this paper falls short in multiple areas. The lack of proper comparisons, insufficient experiments, and clarity issues are deal-breakers. Even if the core idea has merit, the current submission isn't polished enough and doesn't demonstrate the necessary advancements over existing methods.\n\nTherefore, the decision should be to reject the paper. The authors need to address the methodological gaps, improve the experiments, clarify their contributions, and ensure proper comparisons before resubmitting.\n</think>\n\nThe paper proposes a method for OOD detection using graph structures derived from object detection outputs, achieving high AUROC scores on LSUN. However, multiple critical issues undermine its suitability for a top-tier conference:\n\n1. **Lack of Rigorous Comparisons**: The authors fail to compare their method with state-of-the-art (SOTA) OOD detection techniques, instead benchmarking only against graph embedding methods. This omission makes it impossible to assess the method's true competitiveness. Top-tier venues require direct comparisons with SOTA to validate claims of effectiveness.\n\n2. **Poor Clarity and Writing**: The paper suffers from grammatical errors, inconsistent terminology (e.g., \"Near OOD\" vs. Table 1), and vague descriptions of key concepts like \"common sense.\" Figures (e.g., Figure 1) lack explanatory details, and the methodology is not clearly tied to the implementation. These issues hinder reproducibility and understanding.\n\n3. **Experimental Limitations**: \n   - Limited to the LSUN dataset, which is insufficient for generalizability.\n   - No ablation studies to analyze component contributions (e.g., hyperparameters, graph construction choices).\n   - No analysis of how object detection accuracy impacts performance, a critical flaw given OOD data’s inherent variability.\n\n4. **Novelty Concerns**: While the idea of semantic graphs for OOD detection is interesting, reviewers note it primarily combines existing techniques (e.g., graph embeddings, object detection) without significant innovation. The technical novelty is marginal, and empirical results lack context due to missing SOTA comparisons.\n\n5. **Literature Gaps**: The paper neglects key OOD detection literature (e.g., surveys like Yang et al. 2021) and fails to situate its contributions within the broader field, weakening its scholarly rigor.\n\n**Conclusion**: Despite the intriguing premise, the paper’s methodological flaws, insufficient experiments, poor writing, and lack of SOTA comparisons prevent it from meeting the high standards of a top-tier conference. Addressing these issues would be necessary for reconsideration.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

Let's break down each reviewer's points:\n\nReviewer 1: They acknowledge the added section but are concerned about novelty. The main issues are whether extending the loss function beyond Frobenius norm is a big deal and if the operator P(t) comparison with prior work is fair. They suggest toning down some claims.\n\nReviewer 2: They've updated their score to recommend acceptance, so that's a positive sign.\n\nReviewer 3: They like the trajectory comparison (Theorem 3.3) as novel but question the novelty of the main theorems (B.1, B.2, B.3) since similar rates were achieved before.

They still acknowledge correctness but question significance.\n\nReviewer 6: Initially wants to reject due to overclaims in title/abstract, lack of discussion on overparametrization's role, and other issues like figure font size. But says if fixed, they might accept.\n\nNow, considering the standards of a top-tier conference, the key factors are novelty, significance, correctness, and clarity. The paper's main contributions are:\n\n1. Sharp convergence rates for GD on deep linear networks under various initializations.\n2. Showing depth independence when layers are wide enough.\n3. The trajectory tracking result (Theorem 3.3) which seems novel.\n\nBut the reviewers point out that some parts (like the convergence rates) build heavily on prior work (Du & Hu, Hu et al.), and the extension to general losses might not be as novel as claimed. However, Theorem 3.3 is highlighted as a novel insight, which is valuable.\n\nThe technical novelty is mixed. Reviewers 3 and 5 note that the main theorems might not be significantly new, but the trajectory result is a plus. The paper's clarity is generally good except for some minor issues. Correctness is mostly supported, with some minor concerns from Reviewer 6.\n\nThe title and abstract might be overreaching by not specifying overparametrization, which Reviewer 6 points out. The authors need to clarify that their results apply only under overparametrization. Also, the lack of discussion on why overparametrization is essential is a gap that needs addressing.\n\nThe reviewers' scores are mostly in the accept range except for Reviewer 5 and 6, but even they suggest possible acceptance if revised. The key is whether the contributions, especially the trajectory result and the generalization to different initializations and losses, are sufficient for a top conference. Since some reviewers see the trajectory part as novel and the paper is technically correct, but others question the overall significance, it's a borderline case.\n\nHowever, top conferences often require significant novelty. The paper's main theorems might not be groundbreaking, but the trajectory insight and the extension to more initialization schemes and loss functions could tip it towards acceptance, especially if the authors address the title/abstract overclaims and clarify their contributions in the rebuttal. Since multiple reviewers (like 2,4) recommend acceptance and others have conditional acceptance, I think the paper should be accepted with revisions.\n</think>\n\nThe paper under review presents a convergence analysis of gradient descent (GD) for deep linear neural networks, focusing on sharp rates under various initializations and the independence of convergence on network depth when layers are sufficiently wide. While the work has strengths, its novelty and significance are debated among reviewers. Here is the breakdown:\n\n### Key Strengths:\n1. **Novel Trajectory Analysis (Theorem 3.3):** The observation that the product of weight matrices in deep linear networks follows a trajectory close to the convex counterpart (minimizing the collapsed linear model) is highlighted as a novel and insightful contribution. This provides a deeper understanding of how non-convex optimization in linear networks aligns with convex optimization, which is valuable for the field.\n2. **Generalization to Loss Functions and Initializations:** The extension to general strongly convex and smooth loss functions (beyond the Frobenius norm) and broader initialization schemes (e.g., \"one peak random orthogonal projections\") adds practical relevance, even if some reviewers question the technical novelty of these extensions.\n3. **Depth-Independence Result:** The demonstration that convergence rates are independent of depth (under width conditions) is a meaningful contribution, aligning with empirical observations in deep learning.\n\n### Key Weaknesses and Concerns:\n1. **Novelty of Core Convergence Results:** Multiple reviewers (3, 5) note that the sharp convergence rates (e.g., \\(O(\\kappa \\log 1/\\varepsilon)\\)) for Gaussian and orthogonal initializations were already achieved in prior work (Du & Hu, 2019; Hu et al., 2020). The paper’s main theorems (B.1, B.2, B.3) are seen as technical extensions of existing results rather than fundamentally new contributions. The authors must better articulate the technical challenges overcome in generalizing to arbitrary layer widths and initialization schemes.\n2. **Overclaiming in Title/Abstract:** Reviewer 6 points out that the title and abstract omit critical caveats (e.g., overparametrization requirements), which could mislead readers. The results apply only to overparametrized networks, and the title should reflect this.\n3. **Lack of Intuitive Discussion:** Reviewers 4 and 6 note that the analysis is mathematically rigorous but lacks intuitive explanations (e.g., why overparametrization is essential, how regularization or minibatch settings affect results). These gaps weaken the paper’s broader impact.\n4. **Minor Technical Issues:** Some proofs rely heavily on prior techniques, and minor errors (e.g., typos in equations, figure formatting) need correction.\n\n### Balancing the Evaluation:\n- **Novelty:** While the core convergence rates are not groundbreaking, the trajectory analysis (Theorem 3.3) and the extension to broader initialization schemes and loss functions add incremental value. The depth-independence result is a meaningful contribution.\n- **Significance:** The work advances the theoretical understanding of GD in linear networks, which is foundational for studying nonlinear networks. The trajectory insight could inspire future work on non-convex optimization dynamics.\n- **Clarity and Correctness:** The paper is well-written and technically sound, though it requires minor revisions for clarity and completeness.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe paper meets the correctness and rigor standards of a top-tier conference. While its core convergence results build on prior work, the trajectory analysis and generalization to broader settings provide sufficient novelty. The concerns about overclaiming and lack of intuitive discussion can be addressed through revisions. Given the positive endorsements from multiple reviewers (Reviewers 2, 4) and the potential impact of the trajectory result, the paper should be accepted with the following revisions:\n- Clarify the title and abstract to emphasize overparametrization requirements.\n- Expand discussions on the role of overparametrization and technical challenges in extending prior work.\n- Address minor technical and presentation issues.\n\nFinal Decision: Accept"

      "response": "Okay, let's tackle this. The paper is about improving protein-protein interaction (PPI) prediction using pretrained structure embeddings. The main idea is to use structural information from OmegaFold, which is a pretrained model, and then feed those embeddings into a GNN for PPI prediction. \n\nLooking at the reviewers' comments, there's a common theme of limited novelty and technical contribution. Reviewer 1 points out that the method isn't novel because they just use OmegaFold's embeddings and plug them into existing GNNs like SAGE or GAT. The main contribution seems to be combining existing components rather than proposing a new method. That's a big issue for a top-tier conference where novelty is crucial.\n\nAnother point is the empirical results. Reviewers 1, 3, and 4 mention that the improvements are marginal. For instance, Reviewer 2 says there's a 5% improvement, which might not be significant enough. Also, the baselines are questioned. Reviewer 4 points out that they didn't compare against state-of-the-art methods like AlphaFold-Multimer or dMaSIF mentioned by Reviewer 3. If the paper's results don't beat stronger baselines, that's a problem. The lack of confidence intervals and proper statistical validation in the results is another red flag.\n\nTechnical aspects also have issues. Reviewer 1 and 4 question the model design. Using mean pooling might lose important local structural info critical for interactions. Also, the GNN part's necessity is unclear. Why use a GNN over a simpler pairwise model? The paper doesn't provide enough evidence that the GNN adds value. \n\nClarity and reproducibility have mixed feedback. While some say reproducibility is good because of hyperparameters, others like Reviewer 3 found the writing unclear, especially on how AUC is measured and the setup of the classification task. Tables are hard to read without confidence intervals, which makes results less trustworthy.\n\nThe reviewers' scores are mostly low on novelty and significance. Reviewer 1 gave technical and empirical significance a 2 (marginal), while Reviewer 4 even gave empirical significance a 1 (neither). The correctness scores are also low, with Reviewer 4 saying the main claims aren't supported. \n\nConsidering all this, the paper's main contributions are incremental. It uses existing pretrained models and standard GNNs without significant innovation. The experiments don't convincingly show strong improvements over better baselines, and there are methodological flaws like the mean pooling and unclear GNN necessity. For a top conference, these shortcomings would likely lead to rejection. The reviewers' consensus on low novelty and insufficient empirical validation supports that.\n</think>\n\nThe paper proposes using pretrained structural embeddings from OmegaFold combined with graph neural networks (GNNs) for protein-protein interaction (PPI) prediction. While the motivation to incorporate structural information is valid, the reviewers consistently highlight critical shortcomings that undermine its suitability for a top-tier conference:\n\n### Key Issues:\n1. **Limited Novelty and Technical Contribution**:\n   - The method primarily repurposes existing components (OmegaFold embeddings and standard GNN architectures like GraphSAGE/GAT) without proposing novel algorithmic innovations. Reviewers 1, 2, and 4 note that the core idea is incremental, lacking technical significance. The main contribution appears to be combining pre-trained embeddings with GNNs, which is not sufficiently novel for a top conference.\n\n2. **Marginal Empirical Results**:\n   - The reported improvements (e.g., a 5% gain) are modest and not compared to state-of-the-art PPI methods like dMaSIF or AlphaFold-Multimer. Reviewers 3 and 4 criticize the weak baselines (e.g., using simple models like ResNet) and the absence of confidence intervals, making it difficult to assess statistical significance. The lack of comparisons to stronger baselines undermines the paper’s claims of superiority.\n\n3. **Methodological Flaws**:\n   - **Structural Embedding Aggregation**: The use of mean pooling to create fixed-length protein embeddings risks discarding critical local structural information critical for interactions, as noted by Reviewer 1.\n   - **GNN Necessity**: Reviewer 4 questions why a GNN is required at all, given that the task is pairwise interaction prediction. The paper fails to demonstrate that the GNN architecture provides meaningful benefits over simpler pairwise models (e.g., using OmegaFold embeddings directly without GNN aggregation).\n\n4. **Clarity and Reproducibility**:\n   - While hyperparameters are provided, the writing is criticized for poor clarity (e.g., unclear definitions of AUC metrics, lack of confidence intervals, and poorly formatted tables). Reviewer 3 also highlights ambiguities in the experimental setup, such as how binary classification is framed.\n\n5. **Reviewer Consensus**:\n   - All reviewers score the technical and empirical significance as \"marginal\" or worse. Reviewer 4 explicitly states the paper’s claims are unsupported, and Reviewer 2 calls the approach \"not particularly novel.\" The lack of innovation and weak empirical validation align with rejection criteria for top-tier venues.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe paper’s contributions are incremental, its empirical results are underwhelming and incompletely validated, and its methodology contains unresolved flaws. While the problem of PPI prediction is important, the work does not meet the novelty, technical rigor, or impact expected of a top-tier conference like ICLR.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

      "response": "Okay, let's tackle this. The paper is about swapping the order of Batch Normalization (BN) and activation functions, especially with bounded activations like Tanh. The main claim is that putting BN after the activation (Swap) gives better performance than the conventional order (BN before activation) when using bounded activations. They found that this leads to asymmetric saturation and higher sparsity, which they link to better generalization.\n\nLooking at the reviewers' comments, there's a mix of positive and critical points. Reviewer 1 points out that some figures are missing, like the skewness for VGG16_11, which is important for supporting their argument about asymmetric saturation. They also question why Sigmoid wasn't considered, even though it could be adjusted to fit the center requirement. \n\nReviewer 2's summary mentions the Swap model's performance with bounded activations but flags issues with the analysis. The weaknesses include confusion over whether asymmetric saturation and sparsity directly cause better performance. They note that higher layers have lower saturation but still perform well, which the authors didn't address. Also, the sparsity metric's relation to performance isn't clear because sparsity varies by layer. The analysis is limited to non-residual networks and bounded activations, which might not be widely applicable. The reviewer also points out typos and undefined terms like \"center of the function,\" which could hinder clarity.\n\nReviewer 3 thinks the paper is interesting but the analysis isn't thorough. They mention that the Swap model with bounded activations still can't beat ReLU, making the practical impact low. Also, the saturation metric might not be comprehensive, and deeper layers show different behavior, which the authors didn't explain. The reviewer is on the fence but leans towards reject unless clarified.\n\nReviewer 4 finds the observation surprising but wants more justification. They question if the performance gain is due to faster training rather than better generalization. They also ask about the effect of network architecture and whether the swap helps in other tasks besides image classification. The technical novelty is seen as thin.\n\nReviewer 5 has several concerns. They point out contradictions in the saturation-sparsity relationship and unclear claims about why weights increase. The experiments exclude residual networks, which are common, and the Swap models don't outperform ReLU, which limits practical value. They also mention reproducibility issues with the code not clearly showing how metrics are calculated.\n\nOverall, the paper has an interesting observation but faces criticism on several fronts. The main issues are:\n\n1. **Lack of Clear Causality**: The link between asymmetric saturation, sparsity, and performance isn't well-established. Reviewers point out that other factors (like training dynamics or layer depth) might be more influential, and the authors didn't sufficiently rule these out.\n\n2. **Limited Practical Impact**: The Swap model with bounded activations doesn't surpass ReLU-based models, which are standard. This reduces the paper's significance for practitioners.\n\n3. **Methodological Flaws**: The analysis excludes residual networks (common in modern architectures), and some metrics (like saturation) might not be accurately capturing the phenomena they describe. There are also undefined terms and missing figures that weaken the argument.\n\n4. **Reproducibility Concerns**: The code's lack of clarity on how key metrics are computed could hinder reproducibility, which is a red flag for a top-tier conference.\n\nOn the positive side, the observation about the Swap order's performance with bounded activations is novel and could inspire further research. However, the current analysis is seen as insufficient to support strong conclusions. The reviewers' scores (mostly 2-3 on correctness and significance) suggest that while the work has potential, it needs more rigorous analysis and better justification of claims.\n\nConsidering top-tier standards, which demand strong empirical evidence, clear methodology, and significant contributions, this paper falls short. The unresolved issues in the analysis and the lack of practical advantage over existing methods (like ReLU) make it borderline. However, since multiple reviewers highlighted critical flaws in the reasoning and methodology, and the empirical significance is marginal, the decision leans towards rejection.\n</think>\n\nThe paper presents an intriguing observation that swapping the order of Batch Normalization (BN) and bounded activation functions (e.g., Tanh) improves performance, attributed to asymmetric saturation and induced sparsity. However, the reviewers' critiques reveal significant shortcomings that undermine its acceptance at a top-tier conference:\n\n### Key Strengths:\n1. **Novel Observation**: The Swap order’s performance improvement with bounded activations is a novel finding, potentially sparking further research.\n2. **Clear Logic Chain**: The paper’s structure (observing performance gains → analyzing saturation/sparsity → linking to generalization) is logically coherent.\n\n### Major Weaknesses:\n1. **Unclear Causality**:\n   - The link between asymmetric saturation/sparsity and generalization is not rigorously established. Reviewers note that the authors fail to address confounding factors (e.g., layer depth effects, training dynamics) and provide insufficient evidence to rule out alternative explanations.\n   - The sparsity metric’s relationship to performance is inconsistent across layers, and the claim that \"higher sparsity improves generalization\" is not universally supported by the data (e.g., Figure 3 and 4 show reduced saturation in deeper layers but still high accuracy).\n\n2. **Limited Practical Impact**:\n   - Swap models with bounded activations underperform ReLU-based conventional models, limiting real-world utility.\n   - The analysis excludes residual networks (common in modern architectures), reducing generalizability.\n\n3. **Methodological and Clarity Issues**:\n   - **Missing Figures/Data**: Critical figures (e.g., skewness for VGG16_11) and explanations (e.g., \"center of the function,\" NWDBN acronym) are absent, weakening the argument.\n   - **Unresolved Contradictions**: The paper claims that saturation decreases sparsity but also states that Swap models achieve higher sparsity due to saturation. This inconsistency is not addressed.\n   - **Reproducibility Concerns**: The code lacks clarity on how key metrics (saturation, skewness, sparsity) are computed, hindering reproducibility.\n\n4. **Empirical and Theoretical Gaps**:\n   - The analysis does not explore why ReLU’s conventional order outperforms the Swap order, leaving a critical gap in understanding the phenomenon.\n   - The claim that \"asymmetric saturation is beneficial\" is not validated across all layers or architectures, and the role of initialization/batch normalization parameters is underexplored.\n\n### Reviewer Consensus:\n- **Technical Novelty**: While the Swap order’s effect is novel, the analysis is incremental and lacks depth (scores of 2–3 on technical/empirical significance).\n- **Clarity and Rigor**: Ambiguous terminology, missing figures, and incomplete explanations reduce the paper’s persuasiveness.\n- **Practical Value**: The Swap model’s failure to surpass ReLU-based models undermines its significance for practitioners.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe paper’s contributions are interesting but insufficiently supported by rigorous analysis and empirical validation. The unresolved methodological flaws, lack of clarity, and limited practical impact prevent it from meeting the high standards of a top-tier conference. While the observation is novel, the current submission does not provide a sufficiently robust foundation for acceptance.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

The experiments show SOTA on CIFAR-10 under Auto-Attack.\n\nLooking at the reviewers' comments, there's a mix of positive and negative points. Reviewer 1 says the idea is interesting but points out lack of novelty compared to ensemble methods and missing recent baselines. They also mention typos and the need for theoretical analysis. Reviewer 2 is more critical, saying the method isn't novel enough, lacks theory, and the experiments aren't strong enough. They also note the efficiency issue of doubling computational cost. Reviewer 3 is similar, pointing out that the method's novelty is low, comparisons with data augmentation aren't done, and experiments are limited to small datasets. Reviewer 4 thinks it's somewhat novel but wants more ablations and comparisons with stronger baselines like AWP.\n\nThe main strengths are the SOTA results and the straightforward approach. But the weaknesses are significant. The reviewers consistently point out that the idea isn't novel enough—ensemble methods and combining defenses have been done before. The lack of theoretical backing is a problem for a top-tier conference. Also, the computational cost is a practical issue. The experiments are limited to CIFAR datasets and don't include important baselines like more recent ensemble methods or AWP. The authors didn't address existing related work properly, missing key citations.\n\nTop conferences require high novelty and thorough evaluations. While the results are good, the method's incremental nature and the lack of deeper analysis might not meet the bar. The reviewers' consensus seems to lean towards the paper being marginally novel with insufficient comparisons and theoretical grounding. The computational cost is a downside too. However, the SOTA result is a plus. But considering the critiques on novelty and baselines, maybe it's on the borderline.

While the method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on CIFAR-10 under Auto-Attack, several critical issues undermine its acceptance at a top-tier conference:\n\n### Key Strengths:\n1. **Empirical Results**: The method achieves SOTA robustness on CIFAR-10 without additional data, which is a notable practical contribution.\n2. **Clarity**: The paper is well-written and the approach is straightforward to implement.\n\n### Major Weaknesses:\n1. **Novelty**: \n   - The core idea of combining adversarial training methods is not novel. Reviewers highlighted prior work on ensemble adversarial training (e.g., Tramèr et al., 2018; Pang et al., 2019) and knowledge distillation approaches that achieve similar goals. The paper fails to adequately distinguish CAT from these methods.\n   - The collaborative training framework is framed as a \"soft data augmentation,\" but the authors do not compare against relevant data augmentation baselines (as noted by Reviewer 3).\n\n2. **Theoretical and Empirical Gaps**:\n   - **Lack of Theory**: The paper provides no theoretical analysis to explain why combining adversarial methods improves robustness or how the symmetric KL-divergence objective contributes to this.\n   - **Incomplete Baselines**: Key recent baselines (e.g., Adversarial Weight Perturbation (AWP), modern ensemble methods) are missing. The absence of comparisons with these methods weakens the claim of SOTA.\n   - **Limited Experiments**: \n     - Experiments are confined to small datasets (CIFAR-10/100) and limited network architectures. Larger-scale validation (e.g., ImageNet) is missing.\n     - The computational cost (doubling resources) is not justified empirically. No ablation studies explore alternatives like single-model fusion of adversarial examples (suggested by Reviewer 2) or more than two models.\n     - The paper does not analyze whether prediction discrepancies between methods (e.g., TRADES vs. AT) are larger than those within the same method (e.g., two AT runs with different seeds), as questioned by Reviewer 3.\n\n3. **Technical and Practical Concerns**:\n   - **Efficiency**: The doubled computational and memory requirements are a significant drawback for practical deployment, especially given the lack of ablations justifying this cost.\n   - **Typos and Citations**: The paper contains typos and omits critical citations (e.g., \"ALP\" is undefined, and ensemble adversarial training methods are not cited).\n\n4. **Reproducibility**: While hyperparameters are discussed, the lack of code availability and detailed implementation details raises reproducibility concerns.\n\n### Reviewer Consensus:\n- **Novelty and Significance**: Reviewers 2 and 3 rated technical/empirical significance as \"marginal,\" while Reviewers 1 and 4 gave mixed but lower scores.

The paper is about a new validation protocol called PVP, aiming to solve the problem of splitting data into train/validation sets, which can lead to a trade-off between model performance and reliable evaluation. The reviewers have mixed opinions, so I need to weigh their points carefully.\n\nStarting with the strengths: The problem is definitely important. Validation set construction is a fundamental issue in ML, and the trade-off between using data for training vs. validation is a real challenge. The proposed method uses data augmentation and a distributional-consistent sampling to create a validation set without splitting the original data. That's novel, as reviewers mention, and could be impactful if it works.\n\nNow the weaknesses. Reviewer 1 points out that the experiments might not fully address the actual use case of validation sets for model selection. The paper's experiments seem to focus on fixed models, so it's unclear if PVP actually helps in selecting better models through hyperparameter tuning. That's a big gap because validation sets are mainly used for that purpose. Also, the experiments' clarity is an issue. Tables 3 and 4 are confusing, and the metrics like \"deterioration\" aren't well-defined. If the test performance shouldn't change when using different validation sets (since the training data is the same), then those tables might be misleading.\n\nReviewer 2 mentions that the datasets used are too small. Using CIFAR-LT instead of full CIFAR or ImageNet might not demonstrate the method's effectiveness on larger, more realistic scenarios. Also, there's a lack of theoretical backing. The authors don't provide any theory to support why their approach works, which is a problem for a top-tier conference.\n\nReviewer 3 agrees the problem is important but flags several major issues. The method's applicability beyond classification isn't clear, and there's a lack of experiments on real-world or industrial setups. They also point out missing ablation studies on key hyperparameters like the size of the validation set and the sampling ratio. Without these, it's hard to trust the robustness of the method. Plus, statistical significance isn't reported in the main tables, which is a red flag for empirical validation.\n\nReviewer 4 is harsher, saying the approach lacks theoretical basis and the evaluation metrics aren't convincing. They argue that the test-validation gap being low might not mean the validation set is representative of the true data distribution. For example, if you just corrupt labels in a certain way, you could get a low gap without the set being useful. That's a critical point because the core claim is that PVP provides a better evaluation, but without theory or better metrics, it's hard to justify.\n\nLooking at the scores, Reviewers 1, 2, and 4 gave low scores on correctness and significance. Reviewer 3 was borderline but still had major concerns. The empirical evaluations are consistently criticized for being insufficient in scope and clarity. The lack of theoretical support is another recurring issue. While the idea is novel, the execution and validation don't meet the standards of a top conference. The experiments don't fully address the problem's practical use cases, and there are several methodological gaps pointed out by reviewers that aren't addressed in the paper.\n\nConsidering all this, even though the problem is important and the idea has potential, the current paper doesn't provide enough rigorous evidence or thorough analysis to support its claims. The empirical shortcomings and lack of theoretical grounding are significant barriers. Until these are addressed with better experiments, more comprehensive evaluations, and some theoretical justification, the paper probably doesn't meet the bar for acceptance at a top-tier conference.\n</think>\n\nThe paper proposes the Proximal Validation Protocol (PVP) to address the trade-off between training data usage and validation set reliability. While the problem is significant and the method is novel, the paper faces critical shortcomings in empirical rigor, theoretical justification, and experimental design that undermine its credibility for a top-tier conference.\n\n### Key Strengths:\n1. **Novelty and Relevance**: The problem of validation set construction is understudied and practically important. PVP’s use of data augmentation and distributional sampling to avoid data splitting is an original approach.\n2. **Potential Impact**: If validated, PVP could improve model evaluation and selection in real-world ML systems, addressing a gap between academic research and industrial practice.\n\n### Major Weaknesses:\n1. **Empirical Evaluation Flaws**:\n   - **Lack of Realistic Datasets**: Experiments rely on small or lightly modified datasets (e.g., CIFAR-LT instead of ImageNet, limited text datasets), failing to demonstrate scalability or robustness in realistic, large-scale scenarios.\n   - **Unclear Metrics and Results**: Tables 3 and 4 use poorly defined metrics like \"deterioration,\" and the interpretation of results (e.g., test performance differences) is inconsistent with the premise that validation set choice shouldn’t affect fixed model performance.\n   - **Missing Key Experiments**: The paper does not evaluate PVP’s impact on **model selection** (e.g., hyperparameter tuning), which is the primary purpose of validation sets. Without this, the core claim of improved evaluation utility is unproven.\n   - **No Statistical Significance**: Critical results (e.g., Table 1 and 2) lack statistical significance reporting, making it impossible to assess whether observed improvements are meaningful.\n\n2. **Theoretical Gaps**:\n   - The method lacks theoretical justification for why the \"proximal set\" is representative of the true data distribution. Reviewer 4 argues that the test-validation gap metric is insufficient to validate representativeness, and the approach could be gamed (e.g., via label corruption).\n   - The angular-based sampling and weighting in Equation 6 are not rigorously motivated, and ablation studies on hyperparameters (e.g., augmentation choices, sampling ratios) are incomplete.\n\n3. **Scope Limitations**:\n   - The method is framed for classification tasks but lacks evidence of extension to regression, self-supervised learning, or other modalities. The authors do not address whether PVP works for tasks like object detection or NLP beyond classification.\n   - Industrial relevance is underdemonstrated (e.g., no experiments on fine-tuning pretrained models or noisy labels).\n\n4. **Clarity and Reproducibility**:\n   - While code is provided, the paper’s writing contains ambiguities (e.g., undefined terms like \"F1 score\" in Table 3) and stylistic issues (e.g., informal language) that hinder clarity.\n   - The experiments section is poorly structured, making it difficult to evaluate contributions.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe paper’s core idea is promising but underdeveloped. The empirical evaluation is insufficient to justify the claims of superiority over existing methods, and the lack of theoretical grounding raises fundamental questions about the method’s validity. While the problem is important, the current submission does not meet the empirical or theoretical standards required for acceptance at a top-tier conference. Addressing these gaps through rigorous experiments, theoretical analysis, and clearer presentation would be necessary for reconsideration.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

The main idea is that swapping the order of Batch Normalization (BN) and bounded activation functions (like Tanh) leads to better performance compared to the conventional order. They found that this swapped order causes asymmetric saturation and higher sparsity, which they argue improves generalization. The experiments are done on various architectures and activation functions, but they note that even with these improvements, the swapped models still don't beat ReLU-based networks.\n\nNow, looking at the reviewer comments. There are five reviewers, each with their own points. Let me go through each one.\n\nReviewer 1 points out that the paper needs more figures, specifically skewness for VGG16_11. They also question why sigmoid isn't considered, even though it can be adjusted to fit the center requirement. This suggests the paper might have some gaps in their experiments or explanations.\n\nReviewer 2's summary mentions the paper's empirical analysis but flags weaknesses like unclear connections between asymmetric saturation and generalization. They also note that the analysis excludes architectures with residual connections, which are common, and that the swapped models don't outperform ReLU. The reviewer is concerned about the validity of the sparsity argument and the lack of clarity in some terms like \"center of the function.\" They also mention typos and undefined acronyms, which affect clarity. The technical novelty is rated as marginal, and the correctness is 3 (minor issues). The overall recommendation is borderline, but leaning towards reject.\n\nReviewer 3 agrees the topic is interesting but points out the saturation metric might not be complete. They note that deeper layers show different behavior, which the paper doesn't address. Also, since the swapped models can't beat ReLU, the practical impact is low. They mention the paper might overclaim about saturation and gradient issues. Their summary is borderline reject but open to changes.\n\nReviewer 4 thinks the observation is interesting but wants more justification. They question if the performance gain is due to faster training, not better generalization, and ask about other factors like network depth or if the swap works for MLPs. They also note the approach isn't very novel. Correctness is rated lower (2), but technical significance is higher (4). The summary is that it needs more work but has potential.\n\nReviewer 5 has several concerns. They question the rigor of some claims, like why asymmetric saturation leads to sparsity, and point out contradictions in the saturation vs. sparsity metrics. They also note that the experiments exclude residual networks, which limits applicability. The paper's practical contribution is weak since swapped models don't beat ReLU. They also mention reproducibility issues with code. Correctness is 2, and novelty is marginal. Their summary is leaning negative.\n\nLooking at the common themes: \n\n1. **Lack of Practical Impact**: All reviewers note that even though the swapped order improves over conventional with bounded activations, it still can't match ReLU's performance. This reduces the paper's significance for real-world applications where ReLU is standard.\n\n2. **Clarity and Rigor Issues**: Multiple reviewers point out unclear definitions (like \"center of the function\"), undefined terms (NWDBN), and incomplete explanations. The paper's arguments linking asymmetric saturation and sparsity to generalization aren't fully convincing. Some claims are contradictory or not well-supported.\n\n3. **Experimental Limitations**: The analysis excludes architectures with residual connections, which are widely used. The experiments are limited to certain networks (VGG-like), and deeper layers show inconsistent results. The reviewers want more comprehensive experiments, like testing on ResNets or MLPs, and varying hyperparameters.\n\n4. **Theoretical Gaps**: The mechanism behind why the swapped order works isn't fully explained. Reviewers ask for more analysis on why asymmetric saturation helps, whether it's due to faster training, and if similar effects can be induced in conventional models. The paper's theoretical grounding is weak.\n\n5. **Reproducibility Concerns**: Reviewer 5 mentions difficulty finding code for metrics, which is a red flag for reproducibility, a key factor in top-tier conferences.\n\nOn the positive side, the paper presents an interesting observation that swapping BN and activation order with bounded functions improves performance. The empirical setup is detailed enough for reproducibility (per some reviewers), and the topic is relevant. However, the weaknesses seem significant enough to outweigh the contributions.\n\nThe main issues are the lack of practical impact (since ReLU still outperforms), insufficient theoretical backing, and clarity problems. Top-tier conferences usually require strong contributions with clear significance and solid methodology. While the paper has novel observations, the limitations and unresolved questions make it borderline. However, since multiple reviewers (especially 2, 3, 5) rate the technical and empirical significance as marginal and the correctness as having issues, it's leaning towards rejection.\n\nThe authors might address some points in rebuttals, but based on the provided info, the consensus among reviewers is that the paper isn't quite up to the standard yet. The key missing elements are a stronger theoretical foundation, more comprehensive experiments (including residual networks and deeper layers), and clearer explanations to support their claims. Without these, the paper doesn't meet the high bar of a top conference.\n</think>\n\nThe paper presents an interesting observation that swapping the order of batch normalization (BN) and bounded activation functions (e.g., Tanh) improves performance compared to the conventional order. It attributes this improvement to asymmetric saturation and induced sparsity. However, several critical issues undermine its acceptance at a top-tier conference:\n\n### Key Strengths:\n1. **Novel Observation**: The finding that swapping BN and bounded activations improves performance is intriguing and contributes to understanding BN-activation interactions.\n2. **Empirical Analysis**: The paper provides metrics (saturation, skewness, sparsity) and experiments across architectures and activation functions, demonstrating consistent trends.\n\n### Major Weaknesses:\n1. **Limited Practical Impact**: \n   - Swapped models with bounded activations still underperform ReLU-based networks, limiting real-world relevance.\n   - The exclusion of residual networks (widely used in practice) restricts generalizability.\n\n2. **Weak Theoretical and Empirical Rigor**:\n   - **Unclear Causality**: The link between asymmetric saturation/sparsity and generalization is not convincingly established. Reviewers question whether the observed effects are due to accelerated training or other factors.\n   - **Contradictions and Gaps**: \n     - The saturation metric is flawed (e.g., conflates centered distributions with saturation).\n     - Inconsistent behavior in deeper layers (e.g., lower saturation in later blocks) is unaddressed.\n     - The claim that \"asymmetric saturation increases sparsity\" conflicts with the saturation-sparsity metric definition.\n   - **Unresolved Questions**: \n     - Why does ReLU’s conventional order outperform the swapped order?\n     - How does initialization or hyperparameters (e.g., weight decay) affect results?\n\n3. **Clarity and Reproducibility Issues**:\n   - Ambiguous terms (e.g., \"center of the function,\" \"NWDBN\") and undefined acronyms reduce clarity.\n   - Reproducibility is hindered by missing code for key metrics (saturation, skewness, sparsity).\n\n4. **Scope Limitations**:\n   - The analysis is restricted to non-residual architectures and shallow layers, limiting broader applicability.\n   - The exclusion of sigmoid (via translation) and lack of MLP experiments narrow the paper’s relevance.\n\n### Reviewer Consensus:\n- **Technical Novelty**: Marginal (prior work exists on BN order, and the focus on bounded activations is niche).\n- **Empirical Significance**: Limited, as results do not surpass ReLU.\n- **Correctness**: Multiple claims are poorly supported or contradictory (e.g., saturation-sparsity relationship).\n- **Clarity**: Poorly defined terms and incomplete explanations weaken the argument.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile the paper identifies an interesting phenomenon, its unresolved theoretical gaps, limited practical impact, and lack of rigor prevent it from meeting the high standards of a top-tier conference. The reviewers’ critiques highlight critical flaws in both the analysis and presentation that would require substantial revisions beyond the scope of a conference paper.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

      "response": "Okay, let's tackle this. I need to decide whether to accept or reject this paper for a top-tier conference. Let me start by going through all the information provided.\n\nThe paper is about regression with label differential privacy (DP). The key idea is using a prior distribution of labels to create an optimal randomization mechanism, specifically a \"randomized response on bins\" approach. They claim this is better than existing methods like Laplace or Exponential mechanisms. The experiments show their method works well.\n\nLooking at the reviewers' comments. Let's see each one:\n\nReviewer 1: Initially confused the distinction between regression and classification, but after the author's response, they clarified. The main point here seems resolved. The reviewer even mentions a mistake they had, so maybe not a big issue anymore.\n\nReviewer 2: They had a concern about a fair comparison but agreed to include the experiment in the appendix. The reviewer increased their score, so this is a positive sign.\n\nReviewer 3: Points out that the paper is well-written and the method is practical. However, they note that the paper didn't compare against a specific label-DP method (Ghazi et al. 2021). The technical and empirical novelty is rated 3, which is \"somewhat new\". The reviewer still thinks it's a positive contribution but wants a discussion on why they didn't compare with that prior work.\n\nReviewer 4: Gives a high score (8) and says the method is novel and optimal. They point out a weakness about the optimality only considering part of the loss (the first term in equation 1) and not the second term (Bayes error). Also, questions if the number of bins could be smaller than the number of labels. But overall, they think it's a solid contribution.\n\nReviewer 5: Says the paper is well-written and provides experiments. However, they note that the method isn't technically novel compared to Ghazi et al., which the paper generalizes. The technical and empirical novelty is rated 2 (marginal). They also mention that the paper doesn't consider the second term in the loss equation like Ghazi did, which might be important for overall error. The reviewer thinks it's a good paper but not highly novel.\n\nReviewer 6: Thinks the problem is good but notes that mapping continuous labels to bins might be an issue. They mention some typos but overall find it interesting. The novelty is again in the middle (rated 3).\n\nSo, compiling the points:\n\nStrengths:\n- Clear writing and good experiments.\n- Novelty in extending label DP to regression with an optimal mechanism (though some say it's a generalization of prior work).\n- Proofs of optimality and empirical results showing better performance than baselines.\n\nWeaknesses:\n- Lack of comparison with Ghazi et al. (2021), which is a key label-DP work. Reviewers 3 and 5 point this out. The authors might need to address this in the discussion or appendix.\n- The optimality is only with respect to part of the loss (first term), not the entire equation. Reviewer 4 and 5 mention this. The paper might need to discuss limitations here.\n- Technical novelty is mixed. Some reviewers (4) say it's novel, others (5) say it's just a generalization. Since it's a top conference, novelty is important. If it's just extending prior work, maybe that's a problem.\n- The binning approach for continuous labels could be a limitation (Reviewer 6). The authors need to justify why discretization is necessary and how it affects performance.\n\nThe main issues seem to be the comparison with Ghazi et al. and the scope of optimality. The reviewers are split on novelty. Since Ghazi's work is in classification, and this is regression, maybe the extension is novel enough. But if Ghazi's method can be adapted, then the contribution is less. The authors should have addressed that comparison.\n\nThe experiments are thorough, but the lack of a direct comparison with a relevant prior work (even if in the appendix) is a concern. Reviewer 2 suggested adding it to the appendix with a discussion, which would help.\n\nThe optimality claim is only for part of the loss. The paper should clarify that their mechanism optimizes the noise-adding part but doesn't account for the Bayes error term. This is a limitation that needs to be addressed.\n\nOverall, the paper has solid technical contributions and experiments. The main issues are the comparison with prior work and the scope of optimality. Since the reviewers (except 5) generally support it, and the weaknesses can be addressed via revisions (like adding the comparison and discussing limitations), it might be acceptable. However, top conferences require high novelty. If the method is just a straightforward extension, that could be a problem. But since it's for regression, which is different from classification, and they provide an optimal mechanism, maybe it's sufficient.\n\nThe final decision hinges on whether the reviewers' positive aspects outweigh the minor issues. Since most reviewers (especially 4 and 5) give high scores (4 and 3 respectively on technical significance), and the main concerns can be addressed in revisions, I think it should be accepted. The key is that the problem is important, the method is novel in its context, and the experiments support the claims. The missing comparison can be added, and the optimality limitations can be discussed.\n</think>\n\nThe paper proposes a novel approach to achieving label differential privacy (DP) in regression tasks by introducing a \"randomized response on bins\" mechanism. This mechanism is derived under a prior label distribution and is proven to be optimal for minimizing a given regression loss. The experiments demonstrate its efficacy compared to baselines like Laplace and Exponential mechanisms. Key strengths include clear writing, empirical validation, and theoretical guarantees of optimality for the proposed mechanism. However, several critical points emerge from the reviews:\n\n1. **Comparison with Prior Work**: Reviewers 3, 5, and 6 highlight the absence of a direct comparison with Ghazi et al. (2021), a seminal work on label DP for classification. While the paper claims to generalize this approach to regression, the lack of explicit comparison weakens its novelty and practical relevance. Including this comparison (even in the appendix) would strengthen the contribution.\n\n2. **Scope of Optimality**: Reviewers 4 and 5 note that the optimality claim applies only to the noise-induced loss term (first term in Equation 1), not the full generalization error (including the Bayes optimal term). This limitation should be explicitly discussed, as the mechanism may not account for all sources of error in real-world scenarios.\n\n3. **Technical Novelty**: While some reviewers (e.g., 4) emphasize the method’s novelty, others (e.g., 5) argue it is a straightforward extension of prior work. The paper’s contribution hinges on its application to regression, which is distinct from classification, but the novelty is marginal in technical terms.\n\n4. **Practical Considerations**: Reviewer 5 raises concerns about the practicality of the prior distribution estimation and the focus on label loss over generalization error. These points should be addressed in the discussion to contextualize the method’s limitations.\n\n**Conclusion**: The paper addresses an important problem with a theoretically grounded approach and demonstrates empirical effectiveness. While its technical novelty is modest and comparisons with prior work are incomplete, the contributions are sufficient for a top-tier conference if the authors address the reviewers' concerns (e.g., adding comparisons, clarifying optimality limitations, and discussing practical trade-offs). The majority of reviewers (especially 4 and 5) acknowledge the method’s value, and the weaknesses are resolvable through revisions.\n\nFinal Decision: Accept"

      "response": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate whether this paper should be accepted or rejected for a top-tier conference. I need to go through all the provided information carefully.\n\nStarting with the paper's title and abstract: The main focus is on online black-box adaptation to label-shift when there's also conditional-shift. They tested this on synthetic and real datasets, showing some improvements by using validation sets and hyperparameters. The key contributions seem to be exploring the effectiveness of existing methods under these combined shifts, extending to regression, and handling non-invertible confusion matrices.\n\nNow, looking at the reviewer comments. There are four reviewers, and their feedback is mostly critical but not entirely dismissive. Let me break down each reviewer's points.\n\nReviewer 1 points out several weaknesses. The main issues are the lack of a systematic approach to the types of distribution shifts considered. The paper doesn't clearly define terms like \"conditional shift\" and has unclear sections. The experiments are seen as modest in scope, not covering enough baselines or varied shifts. Also, the paper's goals 2 and 3 (regression and confusion matrix fixes) are under-explored. The reviewer thinks the paper needs more context, better experiments, and clarifications but acknowledges the problem's importance.\n\nReviewer 2 says the heuristics don't show significant improvements over the original method. For example, in some datasets, performance is the same or worse. They also note that heuristic 3 is a common practice, so not novel. The lack of intuition behind the heuristics is a problem. The empirical results don't strongly support the claims, and the technical novelty is low.\n\nReviewer 3 criticizes the written quality, unclear notations, and the requirement for a validation set. They argue that the proposed methods still rely on the label shift assumption even when it's broken, which undermines their effectiveness. Also, the Bayesian approach isn't clearly connected to the problem. The paper lacks key comparisons, like using the validation set directly to estimate label distributions. The reproducibility is an issue since code isn't provided.\n\nReviewer 4 mentions the paper isn't self-contained, requiring references to prior work. The methodology isn't detailed enough, especially regarding how parameters are estimated. The Bayesian section is unclear, and there's a lack of theoretical justification. They see the work as preliminary and not ready for publication.\n\nLooking at the scores: Reviewers 1 and 2 gave technical and empirical significance as 2 (marginal), while Reviewer 3 and 4 gave 1 or 2. The correctness scores are mostly 2 or 3, indicating some issues. The consensus seems to be that the paper has some merit but is not yet strong enough for a top conference.\n\nKey issues across all reviews: \n1. **Lack of Theoretical Foundation**: The heuristics are ad-hoc without clear justification, especially when the label shift assumption is violated.\n2. **Empirical Weaknesses**: The experiments are limited in scope, not covering enough baselines (like domain adaptation methods), and results are inconsistent or only marginally better.\n3. **Clarity and Reproducibility**: Poorly defined terms, unclear methods, and missing details make the paper hard to follow and reproduce.\n4. **Novelty**: The contributions are seen as incremental, with some heuristics being standard practices (e.g., adding a diagonal to matrices).\n\nThe problem addressed is important, but the execution falls short. The paper's main contribution is exploring the effectiveness of existing methods under combined shifts, but the experiments don't provide strong evidence. The lack of a clear theoretical framework and thorough empirical analysis (with proper baselines) undermines its impact. The writing and presentation issues further hinder its quality.\n\nConsidering top-tier standards, which require significant contributions, clear presentation, and rigorous evaluation, this paper doesn't meet the bar. The reviewers' consensus is that it needs substantial improvements before acceptance. While the problem is relevant, the current work is too preliminary and lacks the depth required for a top conference.\n</think>\n\nThe paper addresses an important problem of adapting models to distribution shifts, particularly combining label-shift with conditional-shift in an online black-box setting. However, multiple critical issues undermine its suitability for a top-tier conference:\n\n### Key Strengths:\n1. **Problem Relevance**: The investigation of label-shift adaptation under concurrent conditional-shift is timely and relevant, as real-world deployments often face such combined shifts.\n2. **Empirical Exploration**: The paper provides initial empirical insights into how existing methods perform under these conditions, which is a novel contribution.\n3. **Partial Contributions**: The extension to regression and heuristic fixes for non-invertible confusion matrices offer incremental progress.\n\n### Major Weaknesses:\n1. **Lack of Theoretical Justification**: The proposed heuristics (e.g., OOD validation, Bayesian adjustments) lack a principled foundation. Reviewers noted that methods like OOD validation or heuristic fixes for confusion matrices are ad-hoc and lack intuition or theoretical grounding.\n2. **Empirical Limitations**:\n   - **Incomplete Baselines**: Key baselines (e.g., optimal fixed classifiers, domain adaptation methods like CORAL) are missing, making it hard to assess the proposed methods' superiority.\n   - **Mixed Results**: The experiments show only marginal improvements (e.g., no significant gains on S-COCO-on-Places or iWildCam), and some results are inconsistent or noise-level improvements.\n   - **Narrow Scope**: The datasets and shifts studied are limited in variety and complexity, failing to generalize insights to broader scenarios.\n3. **Clarity and Reproducibility**:\n   - **Poor Definitions and Explanations**: Critical terms (e.g., \"conditional shift\") and methods (e.g., FTH-H-B, Bayesian sections) are undefined or ambiguously described.\n   - **Missing Details**: Key experimental protocols (e.g., validation set collection, hyperparameter tuning) are under-specified, hindering reproducibility.\n4. **Novelty Concerns**:\n   - The core idea of using OOD validation and heuristic fixes for confusion matrices are not novel (e.g., heuristic 3 is a standard practice).\n   - The extension to regression is under-explored and lacks comparison to prior work (e.g., Cortes & Mohri, 2011).\n5. **Writing Quality**: The paper is poorly structured, with inconsistent notation (e.g., conflicting uses of \\( f \\)), unclear algorithm descriptions, and missing derivations (e.g., Appendix A lacks context).\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile the problem is important and the paper offers preliminary insights, its technical and empirical shortcomings, lack of theoretical grounding, and insufficient novelty prevent it from meeting the high standards of a top-tier conference. The reviewers' consensus highlights the need for substantial revisions in methodology, experiments, and presentation before the work can be considered competitive for such venues.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

      "response": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate whether this paper should be accepted or rejected for a top-tier conference. Let me start by going through all the provided information carefully.\n\nFirst, the paper's title and abstract. The main idea is about maintaining diverse playing styles in self-play to improve policy generalization. They use a bi-objective optimization model with an evolutionary algorithm. The experiments are in Pong and Justice Online. \n\nLooking at the reviewer comments, there are three reviewers. Let me parse each one's points.\n\nReviewer 1 points out several weaknesses. They mention that the paper doesn't discuss Lanctot et al.'s work on multiagent RL algorithms like Fictitious Play, which are population-based self-play methods. This is a problem because those could be important baselines. Also, the experimental setup in Table 3 is flawed because EMOGI and BiO agents make up most of the pool, giving them an unfair advantage. The reviewer also says the contributions are only marginally novel and the correctness and significance ratings are low (2 out of maybe 4?).\n\nReviewer 2 thinks the paper is mostly clear and the approach is interesting. However, they note that reducing playing style to a single scalar is a big simplification and needs more discussion. They also point out unclear parts in the equations and lack of confidence intervals in results. The empirical results are promising but need more details. Their ratings for correctness are higher (4), but technical and empirical significance are 3 (somewhat new). \n\nReviewer 3 mentions missing baselines like quality-diversity algorithms (MAP-Elites) and domain randomization. They also note that Pong is a simple game and more domains would help. The experimental setup in RQ3 is imbalanced, and there's a question about scaling to higher-dimensional style spaces. The technical novelty is rated low (2), and empirical significance also 2. \n\nSo, compiling the main issues:\n\n1. **Missing Baselines**: Lanctot's Fictitious Play and quality-diversity methods like MAP-Elites aren't included. This is a big gap because these are standard baselines in multi-agent RL and diversity-focused optimization. The paper's comparison is limited to PBT and EMOGI, but not these established methods.\n\n2. **Experimental Design Flaws**: The setup in Table 3 where the test pool heavily favors EMOGI and BiO agents introduces bias. This makes the results less reliable. Also, the selection of opponents might not be fair, as reviewers pointed out.\n\n3. **Simplification of Playing Style**: Reducing style to a single scalar (aggressive vs defensive) is a limitation. The authors don't discuss this simplification's impact or consider higher-dimensional style representations, which is a common approach in related work. This could limit the method's applicability.\n\n4. **Lack of Novelty**: Reviewers 1 and 3 mention that combining multi-objective optimization with RL isn't novel, especially given the quality-diversity literature. The technical contribution is seen as incremental, adapting NSGA-II for self-play without significant innovation.\n\n5. **Empirical Scope**: Only two domains tested, with Pong being simple. More varied and complex environments would strengthen the claims. Also, not testing against domain randomization (a common technique) leaves questions about the method's advantages.\n\n6. **Clarity and Reproducibility**: While the appendix has details, some parts of the paper are unclear (like equations and methodology). The lack of confidence intervals and code hinders reproducibility.\n\nOn the positive side, the approach is straightforward, and the results in the tested domains show promise. The problem addressed (diverse self-play for generalization) is important. However, the method's novelty and thoroughness in addressing prior work are lacking.\n\nTop-tier conferences require strong novelty, rigorous experiments, and thorough comparisons. The paper's main issues—missing key baselines, flawed experiments, and incremental contributions—suggest it doesn't meet those standards. The reviewers' low ratings on novelty and significance, especially from two of them, are concerning. While the problem is valid, the execution and comparisons fall short.\n\nTherefore, the paper should be rejected unless these issues are addressed in a major revision. Since the user is asking for an evaluation based on current info, the decision would be to reject.\n</think>\n\nThe paper proposes a method to maintain diverse playing styles in self-play through a bi-objective optimization framework, aiming to improve policy generalization. While the problem is important and the approach is conceptually straightforward, several critical issues undermine its suitability for a top-tier conference:\n\n### Key Strengths:\n1. **Problem Relevance**: The focus on diversity in self-play to enhance generalization is timely and relevant in multi-agent and reinforcement learning.\n2. **Empirical Results**: The method shows competitive performance in Pong and Justice Online, demonstrating potential utility.\n3. **Clarity**: The paper is generally well-written, and the proposed algorithm is easy to understand.\n\n### Major Weaknesses:\n1. **Missing Baselines**:\n   - **Multi-Agent RL Frameworks**: The paper fails to compare with foundational population-based self-play methods like Fictitious Play (from Lanctot et al., 2017), which are directly relevant. This omission weakens the empirical validation.\n   - **Quality-Diversity Algorithms**: The lack of comparisons to quality-diversity methods (e.g., MAP-Elites) is a significant gap, as these are standard baselines for diversity-driven optimization. This undermines claims of novelty and significance.\n   - **Domain Randomization**: The paper does not test against domain randomization, a common technique to improve generalization, making it unclear whether the proposed method offers unique advantages.\n\n2. **Flawed Experimental Design**:\n   - **Biased Evaluation in Table 3**: The test pool heavily favors EMOGI and BiO agents (30 each), creating an unfair advantage. This design flaw risks overestimating the method’s performance.\n   - **Limited Domain Scope**: While Justice Online is complex, Pong is a simple domain. Additional benchmarks (e.g., StarCraft, MuJoCo) would strengthen claims of general applicability.\n\n3. **Technical and Conceptual Limitations**:\n   - **Simplification of Playing Style**: Reducing style to a single scalar (aggressive/defensive) is a major limitation. This oversimplification is not adequately justified or discussed, and the authors do not explore higher-dimensional style representations common in related work.\n   - **Incremental Novelty**: The adaptation of NSGA-II for self-play is seen as incremental. The core idea of multi-objective optimization in RL is not novel, and the technical contributions are marginal compared to existing quality-diversity literature.\n\n4. **Reproducibility and Clarity**:\n   - **Unclear Methodology**: Portions of the paper (e.g., Equation 4’s \"relevant state change\" and reward weights) lack clarity, and the appendix does not fully resolve ambiguities.\n   - **No Code Release**: While the appendix provides details, the absence of code hinders reproducibility.\n\n### Reviewer Consensus:\n- **Novelty and Significance**: Two reviewers rated technical/empirical significance as \"marginal\" (scores of 2/4), citing incremental contributions and insufficient novelty.\n- **Correctness**: Reviewer 1 flagged \"incorrect or not well-supported claims\" due to flawed experiments and missing baselines.\n- **Empirical Rigor**: The experiments are underwhelming in scope and design, with critical baselines omitted and biased evaluation setups.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile the paper addresses an important problem and shows promising results in limited settings, its failure to engage with key prior work, flawed experimental design, and incremental technical contributions render it insufficient for a top-tier conference. The method’s novelty and robustness are not sufficiently demonstrated to justify acceptance without major revisions.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

Let me start by going through all the information provided.\n\nThe paper's title is \"Functional Risk Minimization,\" and the keywords are learning framework, theory, meta-learning, supervised learning. The abstract mentions breaking the classic assumption of data coming from a single function with noise, instead modeling each data point with its own function. They call this Functional Generative Models (FGM) and propose FRM as a framework. They claim it subsumes ERM for many loss functions, allows more realistic noise, and shows better performance in small experiments. Also, they link FRM to memorizing data and generalization in over-parameterized models.\n\nNow, looking at the reviewer comments. There are three reviewers. Let's parse each one.\n\nReviewer 1 is quite critical. They note the paper's novel approach and potential impact but point out several weaknesses. The main issues are:\n\n1. The algorithm isn't clearly derived from the theory. Equations 7 and 8 (the core algorithm) aren't formally derived, so it's unclear how they relate to the population objective. That's a big problem because the theoretical foundation isn't solid.\n\n2. Scalability: The algorithm uses Hessian approximations (Laplace) which might not scale to large models. The experiments are small-scale, so maybe the method isn't practical yet.\n\n3. No formal guarantees: No proofs that FRM minimizers have low loss, or that the finite-sample version approximates the population objective. Without these, it's hard to trust the claims.\n\n4. Clarity issues: Confusing use of terms like ERM (they redefine it in a non-standard way), FRM vs FGM not clearly separated, and the FRM objective isn't clearly laid out. Typos and formatting issues also mentioned.\n\nClarity is rated poor, but novelty and significance are high. The code is there but not checked. The reviewer thinks the ideas are promising but the current presentation is too flawed for acceptance.\n\nReviewer 2 is more positive but has some concerns. They like the idea of associating each data point with a function, and the paper is well-written with clear examples. However, they question the relation to hierarchical Bayesian models. The key issues here are:\n\n1. The model seems similar to hierarchical Bayesian models, but the authors claim it's different. The reviewer is confused about why, during testing, you use a single parameter instead of individual functions. That inconsistency between training and test assumptions could be a problem.\n\n2. The objective function during training vs test might be mismatched, unlike ERM which is consistent. The implications of this aren't explored.\n\n3. No experiments on the generative model part (section 5). So the evaluation is incomplete.\n\nThey think the paper is valuable but needs more clarity on concepts like hierarchical Bayesian connections and the training/test mismatch.\n\nReviewer 3 is more positive. They see the paper as well-written, novel, and with high quality. The main cons are computational cost and the need to explain why FRM is necessary over modified ERM. They suggest acceptance but note it's marginal.\n\nNow, considering all this. The paper has clear novelty and potential impact, as all reviewers agree. However, there are significant issues in the current submission. Reviewer 1's points are particularly concerning: lack of theoretical backing for the algorithm, unclear derivation, scalability problems, and presentation issues. These are critical for a top conference. The algorithm's connection to the theory isn't clear, which undermines its validity. The experiments are small, and there's no formal analysis of why FRM works better. \n\nReviewer 2's confusion about the model's relation to existing methods (hierarchical Bayesian) and the training/test discrepancy also points to potential flaws in the framework's design. The lack of experiments on the generative model part is a gap.\n\nReviewer 3's positive take is tempered by their note that it's \"marginally above the acceptance line,\" which suggests they're on the fence. \n\nTop-tier conferences require strong theoretical foundations, clear presentation, and solid empirical validation. Here, the theoretical underpinnings are shaky (no proofs, unclear derivation), the algorithm's scalability is in question, and there are unresolved conceptual issues (like the test-time parameter use). The clarity issues across the board (especially from Reviewer 1) make it hard for readers to follow and trust the work. \n\nWhile the idea is novel and promising, the current submission doesn't meet the standards. The authors need to address the theoretical gaps, clarify the algorithm's derivation, provide more experiments (especially on scalability and the generative model), and ensure the framework is well-explained to avoid confusion with existing methods. Without these fixes, the paper isn't ready for a top conference. \n\nSo, the decision should be to reject, but with encouragement to resubmit after addressing these issues.\n</think>\n\nThe paper introduces a novel framework, Functional Risk Minimization (FRM), which reimagines data generation by associating each data point with its own function, diverging from traditional additive noise models. While the concept is innovative and has the potential to address limitations in Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM), the current submission falls short of meeting the rigorous standards of a top-tier conference due to critical flaws in theoretical grounding, algorithmic clarity, and empirical validation. \n\n### Key Strengths:\n1. **Novelty and Potential Impact**: The core idea of modeling data via function-specific latent variables is original and could significantly advance understanding of noise processes and generalization in over-parameterized models.\n2. **Empirical Demonstrations**: The small-scale experiments (e.g., regression tasks) show promising results where FRM outperforms ERM under non-uniform noise, suggesting practical utility.\n3. **Theoretical Insights**: The connection between FRM and memorization provides a new perspective on generalization, which is theoretically intriguing.\n\n### Major Weaknesses:\n1. **Lack of Theoretical Rigor**:\n   - The algorithm (Equations 7 and 8) is not formally derived from the theoretical framework, leaving it unclear how it relates to the population objective. This undermines confidence in its validity.\n   - No guarantees are provided for the performance of FRM (e.g., low loss, convergence, or consistency), and the relationship between the finite-sample and population objectives is unexplored.\n2. **Algorithmic Scalability**:\n   - The proposed method relies on computationally intensive approximations (e.g., Hessian-based Laplace approximations), which may not scale to large models or datasets. The experiments are limited to small-scale tasks, raising doubts about real-world applicability.\n3. **Clarity and Presentation**:\n   - Confusing terminology (e.g., redefining \"ERM\" non-standardly, conflating FRM with the FGM noise model) obscures the contributions and makes the paper difficult to follow.\n   - The training/test discrepancy (using a single parameter at test time despite per-data-point functions) is inadequately addressed, risking conceptual inconsistencies.\n4. **Incomplete Evaluation**:\n   - The functional generative model (FGM) is not empirically evaluated, leaving a key component of the framework untested.\n   - No comparisons to hierarchical Bayesian models (a potential prior work overlap) are provided, weakening the novelty argument.\n\n### Reviewer Consensus:\n- **Reviewer 1** strongly opposes acceptance due to theoretical gaps, scalability concerns, and poor clarity.\n- **Reviewer 2** acknowledges the idea’s value but highlights unresolved conceptual ambiguities and incomplete experiments.\n- **Reviewer 3** is marginally supportive but notes computational costs and the need for stronger justification over ERM.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile the paper’s core idea is promising, the current submission lacks the theoretical depth, algorithmic clarity, and empirical rigor required for a top-tier venue. The unresolved issues in derivation, scalability, and conceptual consistency, coupled with poor presentation, prevent it from being a compelling candidate for acceptance. The authors should address these gaps in a revised version before resubmission.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

      "response": "Okay, let's tackle this. I need to decide whether this paper on data leakage in tabular federated learning should be accepted to a top-tier conference. Let me start by going through all the information provided.\n\nFirst, the paper's title and abstract. The main contribution is TabLeak, an attack method for tabular data in FL, addressing challenges like mixed data types and reconstruction variance. They claim state-of-the-art results on four datasets, with a 10% improvement over baselines on Adult dataset. That sounds impactful, especially since tabular data is common in sensitive areas like finance and legal.\n\nNow the reviewer comments. There are three reviewers. Let me parse each one.\n\nReviewer 1 is pretty negative. They mention the paper isn't well-written with grammar issues and inconsistent tenses. The methods are \"standard,\" so low novelty. They gave technical and empirical significance as 2 (marginal) and correctness 3 (minor issues). The summary says the presentation is so poor it's hard to appreciate the merit.\n\nReviewer 2 is more critical on technical novelty. They point out that softmax relaxations and ensemble methods are common. The benchmarks are weak (using random selection and transferred techniques). They also mention better optimization methods exist (like Gumble trick, branch-and-bound). Technical and empirical significance are 1 (not novel or significant). However, they did say the experiments are reproducible and code is available. Correctness is 4 (all claims correct), but the contributions are weak.\n\nReviewer 3 is more positive. They acknowledge the method is simple, effective, and the experiments are thorough. They point out some issues like unclear claims about the problem's specificity, typos, and questions about the experimental setup. But overall, they think the approach works and the experiments are convincing. They gave technical and empirical significance as 3 and 4, respectively. Correctness is 3 (minor issues).\n\nSo, the main points of contention are novelty and presentation. The paper's core idea is applying existing techniques (softmax, ensembling) to a new domain (tabular FL attacks). Reviewers 1 and 2 think the methods aren't novel enough, while Reviewer 3 thinks it's a novel application with good experiments.\n\nThe abstract mentions it's the first comprehensive attack on tabular data, which is a strong point. The experiments show a 10% improvement, which is significant. However, the baselines might be weak, as Reviewer 2 noted. The authors used random selection and methods from continuous cases, which might not be the strongest competitors. But if those are the current baselines in the field, maybe that's okay.\n\nThe writing issues are a problem. Reviewer 1's comments about grammar and clarity are serious for a top conference. However, Reviewer 3 found it well-written except for some typos. Maybe the main paper is okay, but the supplementary or certain sections had issues. The authors might be able to fix that in revisions.\n\nTechnical novelty: The problem of tabular data in FL attacks is new. The combination of softmax for discrete variables and pooling might be novel in this context. Reviewer 3 points out that prior work in NLP used embeddings but maybe didn't handle the mixed data as effectively. The entropy measure for quality assessment is also a new heuristic here.\n\nThe empirical results are solid with multiple datasets and ablation studies. Reviewer 3's detailed comments suggest the experiments are thorough, even if some aspects need clarification. The 10% improvement is notable, especially if it's on a relevant batch size (32). The fact that they can handle up to 128 is also a plus.\n\nThe main weaknesses are the methods being standard and the writing. But top conferences do accept papers that apply existing methods to new areas with strong empirical results. The problem's novelty and the clear improvement over baselines might outweigh the lack of groundbreaking techniques.\n\nHowever, the reviewers' scores on technical novelty are mixed. Reviewer 3 gives a 3 (somewhat new), while others give lower. The empirical significance is higher according to Reviewer 3. The key is whether the problem is important enough. Since tabular data is critical in high-stakes applications, the vulnerability they expose is significant for the FL community.\n\nThe presentation issues need to be addressed. If the paper is accepted, the authors must revise for clarity and grammar. But top conferences often give the benefit of the doubt if the content is strong enough, especially in emerging areas like FL privacy attacks.\n\nIn conclusion, the paper addresses an important problem with a novel application of existing methods, backed by solid experiments. The technical contributions might not be earth-shattering, but the problem's significance and empirical results tip the balance. The writing can be fixed in revisions. So, I think it should be accepted.\n</think>\n\nThe paper addresses a critical and understudied problem in federated learning (FL) by proposing the first comprehensive reconstruction attack (TabLeak) tailored to tabular data, which is prevalent in high-privacy domains like finance and healthcare. The core contributions—softmax structural priors, pooled ensembling, and entropy-based quality assessment—address unique challenges posed by mixed discrete-continuous data, such as optimization complexity and reconstruction variance. While reviewers highlight limitations (e.g., reliance on standard techniques, weak baselines, and writing issues), the problem’s significance and empirical impact outweigh these concerns. \n\n**Key Strengths:**\n1. **Novel Application Domain:** The paper is the first to systematically study data leakage attacks in tabular FL, a critical gap given the prevalence of tabular data in sensitive applications. This novelty in problem framing is substantial, even if individual techniques (e.g., softmax relaxation) are not entirely new.\n2. **Empirical Rigor:** The experiments demonstrate clear improvements over baselines (e.g., 10% accuracy gain on Adult dataset) and validate the method’s robustness across batch sizes and datasets. The ablation studies and entropy heuristic provide actionable insights for evaluating reconstruction quality.\n3. **Practical Relevance:** The findings highlight vulnerabilities in FL for tabular data, which is a pressing concern for industries relying on privacy-preserving machine learning.\n\n**Weaknesses and Concerns:**\n1. **Technical Novelty:** Reviewers 1 and 2 argue that the methods (softmax relaxation, ensembling) are standard, and better optimization techniques exist. However, the combination and adaptation to tabular data’s mixed-type challenges represent a meaningful contribution.\n2. **Writing and Presentation:** Reviewer 1 criticizes the writing quality, but Reviewer 3 notes it is generally clear. These issues can be addressed in revisions.\n3. **Baseline Comparisons:** The baselines (e.g., random selection) are weak, and stronger alternatives (e.g., linear models) were not tested. However, the paper’s focus on FL-specific attacks justifies the chosen baselines, and the improvements are still notable.\n\n**Conclusion:** While the technical contributions are incremental, the problem’s importance and the paper’s empirical rigor justify acceptance. The vulnerability it exposes in tabular FL is significant, and the methods provide a foundation for future work. The writing issues are fixable, and the novelty of addressing tabular data in this context outweighs the criticisms of standard techniques.\n\nFinal Decision: Accept"

Let me start by going through all the provided information carefully.\n\nFirst, the paper's title is \"Multi Task Learning of Different Class Label Representations for Stronger Models.\" The abstract mentions using binary labels as an auxiliary task alongside one-hot vectors, showing improvements in accuracy and data efficiency. The keywords are label representation, image classification, etc.\n\nLooking at the reviewer comments, there are four reviewers. Let me go through each one's points.\n\nReviewer 1 says the idea is interesting but the experiments are weak. They point out clarity issues, like not explaining terms like \"dense labels\" and \"Metabalance.\" The experiments lack comparisons with baselines, more datasets, and analysis. They also mention reproducibility issues because some details are missing. The related work could be better, especially regarding label smoothing and other multi-task methods. The reviewer thinks the paper is promising but needs more work.\n\nReviewer 2 is more critical. They say the claims aren't well-supported, the notation is poor, and there are calculation errors. They noticed inconsistencies in the example (like the number of groups not matching the figure). The experiments are insufficient, and the baseline performance is too low. They rate correctness as 1, which is bad, but technical novelty as 4. Hmm, conflicting scores here. They think the paper needs major improvements.\n\nReviewer 3 is more positive. They acknowledge the method is simple and works, especially on harder tasks. But the improvements are small, and there's a lack of analysis. They mention missing related work on label coding. Clarity is okay, but the contribution's significance is marginal. They suggest expanding the results for acceptance.\n\nReviewer 4 points out limited technical contribution. The multi-task setup is basic, and the paper doesn't explain why binary labels help. Implementation details are missing, making reproducibility hard. They want more analysis on task weighting and experiments on larger datasets like ImageNet. They also question the metric (data efficiency vs. label efficiency). They think the contribution is marginal.\n\nNow, considering all these points. The main strengths are the novel idea of using binary labels as an auxiliary task, showing some improvements in accuracy and data efficiency. The method is simple and could be useful in certain domains. However, the weaknesses are significant. The experiments are limited in scope and baselines. Clarity issues and reproducibility problems are mentioned by multiple reviewers. The related work isn't thorough, missing key papers. The technical novelty is considered marginal by most, and some reviewers found the claims not well-supported.\n\nTop-tier conferences usually require strong empirical results, thorough analysis, and clear presentation. The paper's experiments are described as weak, with insufficient baselines and datasets. The lack of results on a large dataset like ImageNet is a red flag. The reproducibility issues (like not explaining Metabalance or implementation details) are problematic. The clarity issues and typos also detract from the paper's quality.\n\nThe reviewers' scores are mixed. Reviewer 2 gave a low correctness score, which is a big issue. Reviewers 1, 3, and 4 have concerns about significance and experiments. While there's some novelty, the marginal contributions and execution flaws might not meet the high bar of a top conference. The authors need to address the clarity, experiments, and related work thoroughly. Since the current version has these shortcomings, it might not be ready for acceptance yet.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject\n</think>\n\nThe paper proposes an interesting idea of using binary labels as an auxiliary task in multi-task learning to improve classification performance. While the core concept is novel and shows some empirical improvements, several critical issues undermine its readiness for a top-tier conference:\n\n### Strengths:\n1. **Novelty**: The use of randomly generated binary labels as an auxiliary task is a fresh angle, and the method is simple yet potentially impactful for certain domains (e.g., fine-grained classification).\n2. **Empirical Results**: The paper demonstrates modest improvements in accuracy and data efficiency across several datasets, suggesting potential utility in resource-constrained scenarios.\n3. **Relevance**: Label representation is an understudied area, and the work opens avenues for further exploration in this direction.\n\n### Weaknesses:\n1. **Experimental Rigor**:\n   - **Limited Baselines**: The experiments lack comparisons with strong baselines (e.g., label smoothing, dense labels, or existing multi-task methods mentioned in related work).\n   - **Incomplete Analysis**: The paper does not explore why the method works (e.g., ablation studies on binary label generation, task weighting, or sensitivity to random seeds). It also fails to address scenarios like distribution shifts or robustness.\n   - **Dataset Scope**: Experiments are limited to smaller datasets (e.g., CIFAR-100, Caltech101) and lack validation on large-scale benchmarks like ImageNet, which is critical for credibility in top-tier venues.\n   - **Implementation Details**: Key details (e.g., Metabalance, hyperparameters, training protocols) are omitted, hindering reproducibility.\n\n2. **Clarity and Presentation**:\n   - **Ambiguities**: The paper lacks clear explanations of core concepts (e.g., \"dense labels,\" \"Metabalance\") and contains errors (e.g., inconsistent group counts in Figure 2, unclear notation).\n   - **Related Work**: Fails to adequately discuss prior work on label coding (e.g., error-correcting output codes) and unsupervised meta-learning, weakening the novelty claim.\n\n3. **Technical Significance**:\n   - **Marginal Contributions**: While the idea is novel, the improvements are small and inconsistent across datasets. The method’s reliance on random binary labels raises questions about robustness and generalizability.\n   - **Lack of Insight**: The paper does not provide a theoretical or empirical explanation for why binary labels improve performance, leaving the mechanism unclear.\n\n4. **Reviewer Concerns**:\n   - Multiple reviewers flagged reproducibility issues, weak experiments, and insufficient analysis. Reviewer 2 rated correctness as 1 (indicating unsupported claims), and most reviewers deemed the technical significance marginal.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe paper’s contributions, while promising, are insufficiently developed for a top-tier conference. The experimental section is underwhelming, the presentation is unclear, and critical gaps in analysis and related work remain. Addressing these issues could strengthen the work, but in its current form, it falls short of the high standards required for acceptance.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

      "response": "Okay, let's tackle this. The paper is about Scrunch, a method for privacy-preserving representation learning in MLaaS. The goal is to prevent sensitive info leakage while keeping task accuracy high. The reviewers have given their feedback, so I need to weigh their points.\n\nFirst, looking at Reviewer 1. They mention the idea isn't new, just splitting the network and adding constraints. The experiments are limited to two datasets and only one baseline. They also point out the paper is incremental with no big \"aha\" moment. The novelty is low, and the experiments aren't thorough enough. They suggest comparing with FHE approaches, which the authors didn't do. Clarity issues too, like grammar errors. So Reviewer 1 is negative, saying it's not up to ICLR standards.\n\nReviewer 2's critique is more technical. They point out serious flaws in the threat model. The method requires training the encoder, which the server can reverse-engineer because they have access to labels and class centers. The server could even disable the center loss, undermining privacy. Also, the encoder's privacy only applies during inference, not training. That's a major issue because training phase leakage isn't addressed. Plus, the MNIST experiment lacks clarity on the private task, and the models used are shallow. The paper didn't consider deeper networks like ResNet. The reviewer also mentions ambiguity in the text, like mixing up intra and inter-class distances. They think the approach is similar to split learning but not cited. So Reviewer 2 is very critical, saying the results are unconvincing and the method has fundamental flaws.\n\nReviewer 3 adds that the security model isn't defined. They question if middle-layer features are safe, like in time-series data from a smartwatch. The features might still leak trends. Also, for NLP, frequent words could be inferred from encodings. The reviewer thinks encryption is still needed, so the method isn't sufficient. They also note the lack of a clear security model, making the privacy claims weak.\n\nPutting this together: The main issues are the flawed threat model (server can subvert privacy measures), insufficient experiments (only two datasets, shallow models, missing baselines), and lack of novelty. Reviewers 2 and 3 highlight critical technical flaws that undermine the paper's core claims. The method's privacy guarantees are questionable because the server has too much control and access during training. The experiments don't cover enough scenarios, and the approach isn't novel enough. The writing has clarity issues too.\n\nTop-tier conferences require strong technical contributions, thorough evaluations, and clear novelty. Here, the technical approach has fundamental flaws pointed out by Reviewer 2, which aren't addressed. The experiments are limited, and the problem isn't convincingly solved. The incremental nature and lack of significant novelty also hurt its chances. Even if the idea is somewhat novel, the execution and validation aren't sufficient for a top conference. The reviewers' consensus is that it's not up to standard, especially with the critical flaws in the method's design.\n</think>\n\nThe paper proposes a privacy-preserving representation learning method called Scrunch for MLaaS, aiming to prevent sensitive attribute inference while maintaining task accuracy. However, the reviewers' critiques reveal significant shortcomings that undermine its viability for a top-tier conference:\n\n1. **Technical Flaws in Threat Model**:  \n   Reviewer 2 identifies critical vulnerabilities. The proposed method assumes the server (adversary) will honestly implement the center loss, but the server could disable it or reconstruct the encoder via model inversion attacks. The training phase exposes sensitive information (e.g., labels, class centers) to the server, which the method does not address. This invalidates the privacy guarantees, as the server could trivially reverse-engineer the encoder or bypass privacy constraints. The paper also fails to define a clear security model, leaving these issues unaddressed.\n\n2. **Lack of Novelty and Incremental Contribution**:  \n   Reviewers 1 and 3 note that splitting neural networks for privacy (e.g., split learning) is not novel, and the core idea is incremental. The use of center loss as an additional constraint is insufficient to justify a top-tier publication. The paper does not cite relevant prior work (e.g., split learning), weakening its novelty claims further.\n\n3. **Weak Empirical Evaluation**:  \n   The experiments are limited to two shallow models (LeNet-5, VGG-16) and datasets (MNIST, CelebA). Baseline comparisons are sparse (only Shredder on MNIST), and deeper architectures (e.g., ResNet, Vision Transformers) are not tested. The MNIST experiments lack clarity on the private task, and the chosen privacy metrics (e.g., expression inference from gender recognition) are not compelling. Reviewer 2 also highlights that the evaluation does not address more realistic scenarios (e.g., identity inference vs. gender).\n\n4. **Clarity and Reproducibility Issues**:  \n   While the paper is generally clear, grammatical errors and ambiguous statements (e.g., confusing intra/inter-class distances) detract from its quality. Key details (e.g., optimizers, training epochs) are missing, hindering reproducibility. Reviewer 3 questions the method’s applicability to NLP and time-series data, suggesting its utility is narrow.\n\n5. **Fundamental Design Flaws**:  \n   Reviewer 3 emphasizes that middle-layer features may still leak sensitive information (e.g., time-series trends, frequent words in NLP). The paper does not address these risks, and the proposed method’s reliance on unencrypted feature transmission leaves it vulnerable to reverse engineering without additional cryptographic measures.\n\n**Conclusion**: The paper’s core technical approach suffers from critical design flaws in its threat model and privacy guarantees. The empirical evaluation is insufficient to validate its claims, and the contribution is incremental relative to existing work. These issues collectively render the work unsuitable for a top-tier conference like ICLR, which demands stronger technical novelty, rigorous evaluation, and robustness against realistic adversarial scenarios.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

I need to go through all the provided information carefully.\n\nFirst, looking at the paper's abstract and title, it's about identifying phase transition thresholds in permuted linear regression using message passing algorithms. The authors claim they provide precise thresholds, which is a step beyond previous work that only looked at convergence rates without constants. That sounds potentially significant, but I need to check the reviews.\n\nNow, the reviews. There are five reviewers. Let's go through each one's comments.\n\nReviewer 1 is critical. They mention the paper is poorly written and notation-heavy, making it hard to follow, especially for someone not familiar with prior works like Semerjian et al. They point out that the paper isn't self-contained, which is a big issue for conference submissions. The reviewer also questions the novelty, saying the result is incremental, relying on existing estimators and methods. They suggest the paper might be better suited for a journal. The technical content has some issues, like unclear explanations of key steps and missing references. The reviewer's final verdict is rejection unless major reorganization happens.\n\nReviewer 2 is also negative. They think the main contribution (non-oracle case) is only approximate and not fully rigorous. The oracle case is seen as a corollary of existing work. They criticize the practical motivation for partial permutation recovery, noting that the experiments show it requires higher SNR but the paper claims it's almost as good. Writing issues are mentioned again, like unclear sections and typos. They also point out reproducibility issues because code isn't provided. Their conclusion is rejection.\n\nReviewer 3 is more neutral. They acknowledge the paper's interesting results on phase transitions but note it's not well-written with typos and standard techniques. They give a higher correctness score but still recommend rejection because of clarity and reproducibility (no code). However, their confidence is low since they're not an expert on message passing.\n\nReviewer 4 is more positive. They like the analysis and the novel contribution of precise phase transition thresholds, which prior work didn't have. They appreciate the technical depth but note the paper could be clearer and reproducibility is an issue without code. They suggest acceptance if code is added but are on the fence.\n\nReviewer 5 is very harsh. They find the writing terrible, making the paper inaccessible. They point out numerous technical inaccuracies and unclear explanations, especially in sections about message passing. They argue the claims aren't well-supported and the paper is too vague.

Reviewers 3 and 4 are more mixed but still have concerns. The key issues are:\n\n1. **Clarity and Writing**: Multiple reviewers mention poor writing, heavy notation, lack of self-containment, and typos. This is a major barrier for a conference paper where accessibility is crucial.\n\n2. **Novelty and Contribution**: While the paper claims to provide precise thresholds, reviewers 1 and 2 argue it's incremental, building on existing methods (Semerjian, Zhang et al). The non-oracle case uses approximations which aren't fully rigorous. The oracle case is seen as a corollary.\n\n3. **Technical Soundness**: Some claims are unsupported (e.g., partial recovery performance), and there are gaps in explanations (e.g., Assumption 1's justification). Reviewer 5 even says main claims are incorrect.\n\n4. **Reproducibility**: No code provided, making it hard to verify results. Numerical experiments are mentioned but not clearly tied to the text.\n\n5. **Structure**: The paper is disorganized, with sections that repeat prior work or are unclear. Reviewers suggest reorganization but the current state is too messy.\n\nConsidering top-tier conferences require high standards in clarity, novelty, and technical soundness. The paper's main contributions are incremental and the writing is a significant barrier. Even if the technical content has merit, the presentation and reproducibility issues make it unsuitable for a conference where the audience expects polished, accessible work. The reviewers' consensus leans towards rejection, especially with multiple low scores and critical comments on core aspects.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject\n</think>\n\nThe paper addresses the problem of identifying phase transition thresholds in permuted linear regression using message passing algorithms. While the authors claim to provide precise thresholds beyond prior work, the reviews highlight significant issues that undermine its suitability for a top-tier conference:\n\n1. **Clarity and Writing**: Multiple reviewers (1, 2, 5) emphasize that the paper is poorly written, notation-heavy, and lacks self-containment. Key sections (e.g., message passing derivations) are unclear, requiring prior knowledge of referenced works (e.g., Semerjian et al.) to follow the arguments. Typos, grammatical errors, and undefined terms (e.g., \"Ener\") further hinder readability. These issues make the paper inaccessible to a general conference audience.\n\n2. **Novelty and Contribution**: Reviewers 1 and 2 argue that the work is incremental. The oracle case is framed as a corollary of existing results, while the non-oracle case relies on approximations that are not fully rigorous. The partial permutation recovery analysis is criticized for being undermotivated and overstated (e.g., claiming performance \"almost matches\" full recovery despite experimental evidence to the contrary). The technical novelty is deemed marginal compared to prior work.\n\n3. **Technical Soundness**: Several claims are unsupported or ambiguously presented. For instance, Assumption 1 lacks justification, and the connection between the non-oracle estimator and message passing equations is unclear. Reviewer 5 raises serious concerns about the mathematical rigor of core sections (e.g., message passing derivations), while Reviewer 2 notes that the non-oracle threshold is only \"approximately\" identified. The empirical results are not clearly tied to theoretical claims, and the absence of code undermines reproducibility.\n\n4. **Reproducibility**: The authors do not provide code, making it difficult to verify the experiments. Numerical results (e.g., Tables 1–3, Figure 2) are mentioned but not sufficiently explained in the text, and some experimental claims (e.g., alignment with theoretical predictions) are vague or misleading.\n\n5. **Structure**: The paper is disorganized, with redundant sections (e.g., background overlapping with prior works) and unclear transitions between technical arguments. Reviewers suggest major reorganization, but the current structure is too fragmented for a conference submission.\n\nWhile Reviewer 4 acknowledges the technical merit of precise phase transition analysis and Reviewer 3 sees potential in the results, the overwhelming consensus is that the paper’s clarity, novelty, and presentation fall short of top-tier standards. The incremental contributions and accessibility barriers are particularly problematic for a conference, where contributions must be both impactful and clearly communicated.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

Let me start by going through all the information provided.\n\nThe paper is about Federated Learning (FL) and proposes a new aggregation method called FedPA to address both client drift and a newly introduced concept called period drift. The main idea is using a parameterized aggregator trained via meta-learning to reduce aggregation bias. The experiments are on EMNIST and MovieLens datasets.\n\nLooking at the reviewer comments, there are several points to consider. \n\nFirst, Reviewer 1 points out that the paper doesn't clearly distinguish between client drift and period drift, both theoretically and experimentally. They also mention that the aggregation uses a proxy dataset, which is similar to existing methods like FedET and DS-FL, but without proper comparison. The experiments are criticized for using simple datasets and models, and there's no ablation study on the proxy data's impact. Clarity and reproducibility are issues too, with no code provided.\n\nReviewer 2 acknowledges the problem of period drift as a novel contribution but questions the necessity of using meta-learning over other approaches like temporal regularization. They also note that the paper lacks a discussion on why meta-learning is suitable here and points out some technical inconsistencies, like the dynamic system analogy being unnecessary. The experiments are considered comprehensive but the method's novelty is marginal. The reviewer is leaning towards rejection.\n\nReviewer 3 raises concerns about the practicality of the proxy dataset assumption and privacy issues since the server needs access to client model updates. They also mention that the method seems ad-hoc and the experiments underperform compared to existing baselines. The lack of ablation studies and hyperparameter details is another red flag. While the idea is novel, the execution and experiments need improvement.\n\nReviewer 4 appreciates the problem formulation but notes writing issues and the need for more experiments on other datasets. They also question scalability and the server's computational overhead. The paper's technical aspects are okay but not groundbreaking.\n\nNow, considering the criteria for a top-tier conference, the paper needs to have significant contributions, solid methodology, thorough experiments, and clear writing. The main strengths are the identification of period drift and the meta-learning approach. However, the weaknesses are substantial. The lack of clear distinction between period and client drift, insufficient comparisons with similar methods, and the proxy dataset dependency are major issues. The experiments are limited in scope and performance, and there's no code for reproducibility. Multiple reviewers pointed out that the method's novelty is marginal and that existing works address similar problems. The writing and clarity issues also detract from the paper's quality.\n\nTop conferences require strong empirical results and a clear demonstration of superiority over baselines. The paper's experiments don't meet this standard, especially with lower accuracy on FEMNIST compared to prior work. The method's reliance on a proxy dataset and potential privacy concerns are also problematic. Without ablation studies and a thorough analysis of the method's components, it's hard to justify its effectiveness.\n\nIn conclusion, while the problem addressed is relevant, the paper's shortcomings in methodology, experiments, and presentation outweigh its contributions. The lack of significant novelty and rigorous evaluation suggests it doesn't meet the high bar for acceptance at a top-tier conference.\n</think>\n\nThe paper proposes FedPA, a meta-learning-based aggregation method for federated learning (FL) to address both client drift and a newly introduced \"period drift.\" While the problem of period drift is an interesting contribution, the paper faces significant challenges that undermine its suitability for a top-tier conference. \n\n### Key Strengths:\n1. **Novel Problem Identification**: The concept of \"period drift\" (heterogeneity across communication rounds) is a novel angle in FL research, potentially highlighting an under-explored aspect of non-IID data dynamics.\n2. **Technical Approach**: The use of a parameterized aggregator trained via meta-learning introduces a different perspective compared to traditional aggregation methods like FedAvg.\n3. **Empirical Validation**: The paper includes experiments on two datasets (EMNIST and MovieLens), showing competitive performance against some baselines.\n\n### Major Weaknesses:\n1. **Lack of Clear Differentiation**: The paper fails to theoretically or empirically distinguish between \"period drift\" and existing \"client drift.\" Reviewers argue that the distinction is not well-defined, and the experiments do not isolate or validate the impact of period drift specifically.\n2. **Insufficient Novelty**: The aggregation strategy using a proxy dataset and meta-learning is criticized as similar to prior work (e.g., FedET, DS-FL), yet the paper does not adequately compare or contrast with these methods. The meta-learning framework’s necessity over simpler approaches (e.g., temporal regularization) is unconvincing.\n3. **Empirical Limitations**: \n   - The experiments use simple datasets (EMNIST and MovieLens) and models, lacking validation on more challenging benchmarks like CIFAR-100 or Stack Overflow.\n   - Performance on EMNIST is subpar compared to existing methods (e.g., <80% accuracy vs. >80% in baselines like AFO).\n   - No ablation studies to analyze the impact of proxy data distribution, aggregator architecture, or hyperparameters.\n4. **Methodological Flaws**:\n   - The proxy dataset requirement limits practicality and raises privacy concerns (e.g., centralized access to client updates violates FL privacy principles).\n   - The method’s scalability is unaddressed (e.g., computational overhead of training the aggregator).\n5. **Clarity and Reproducibility**: \n   - Writing quality is poor (grammatical errors, unclear explanations).\n   - No code is provided, and experimental details (e.g., hyperparameter choices) are insufficiently documented.\n6. **Theoretical Gaps**: The paper lacks a rigorous analysis of why meta-learning is the optimal solution for period drift, and technical sections (e.g., dynamic system analogy) are confusing or irrelevant.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile the paper addresses a relevant problem in FL, its contributions are incremental and insufficiently validated. The lack of clear theoretical grounding, empirical rigor, and reproducibility, combined with significant overlap with existing work, undermines its value for a top-tier conference. The reviewers’ consensus on marginal novelty, weak experiments, and poor presentation further supports rejection.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

      "response": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate whether the paper \"RuDar: Weather Radar Dataset for Precipitation Nowcasting with Geographical and Seasonal Variability\" should be accepted or rejected for a top-tier conference like ICLR. \n\nFirst, I need to go through all the provided information: the paper's abstract, the reviewers' comments, and their scores. Let me start by summarizing the key points from each section.\n\nThe paper introduces the RuDar dataset, which adds a 3D dimension to precipitation measurements, including altitude levels from 1km to 10km. This is a significant addition compared to existing datasets that only have single-level or aggregated data. The dataset covers multiple climate zones in Russia, has a 10-minute update interval, and includes over 50,000 timestamps. They also evaluated baseline models like optical flow and neural networks, and looked at uncertainty quantification.\n\nNow, looking at the reviewers' comments. \n\nReviewer 1 says the dataset is attractive but notes limited novelty and domain relevance. They mention that the methods used are low-cost and wonder about more advanced models like transformers. They also question the dataset's usability and whether models trained on it can compete with existing systems. The technical and empirical significance are rated low (2/4), but correctness is high (4/4). Clarity is good, reproducibility is okay.\n\nReviewer 2 acknowledges the dataset's importance, especially the multi-climate zones and temporal coverage. However, they point out weaknesses like naive baselines, lack of ablation studies, and insufficient evaluation metrics (only MSE used). They also mention missing comparisons with previous methods on this dataset and a lack of related work details. The correctness is 3/4, technical significance 3/4, empirical 2/4. They suggest a journal might be better.\n\nReviewer 3 praises the dataset's richness and the comparison with other datasets, but criticizes the lack of methodological novelty. The uncertainty estimation is called simple, and the dataset's grid size might be too coarse for precipitation tasks. They argue that while the dataset is useful, it's too similar to existing ones for an ICLR publication. Technical novelty is 2/4, empirical 3/4. Clarity is good, but the main contribution isn't novel enough.\n\nSo, the main points against acceptance are the lack of technical novelty, the baselines being too basic, and the dataset not being sufficiently distinct from existing ones. The reviewers agree the dataset is good but not groundbreaking. The empirical evaluations are seen as weak, with limited metrics and no advanced models tested. \n\nOn the positive side, the dataset is well-constructed, covers important geographical and seasonal variations, and is publicly available. The paper is clear and reproducible. However, for a top conference, the contributions need to be more novel. The reviewers' scores on technical and empirical significance are mostly low (2s and 3s), which is a red flag. \n\nICLR typically requires significant contributions in terms of new methods, theories, or impactful datasets. While RuDar is a solid contribution, the reviewers point out that it's an incremental improvement over existing datasets. The lack of methodological innovation and the underwhelming baseline evaluations (no transformers, limited metrics) might not meet the conference's high standards. \n\nThe authors might have a better chance in a more specialized journal where the dataset's practical value is more appreciated. Since all reviewers, even the most positive, suggest it's not up to ICLR's bar, the decision leans towards rejection. The key issue is the lack of novelty and the insufficient evaluation to demonstrate the dataset's transformative impact.\n</think>\n\nThe paper introduces the RuDar dataset, which addresses a critical gap in precipitation nowcasting by incorporating 3D radar echo observations across multiple altitude levels, geographical regions, and seasons. The dataset is substantial (50,000+ timestamps, 100 GB) and includes novel features like orography data. However, the reviewers consistently highlight significant limitations that undermine its suitability for a top-tier conference like ICLR:\n\n### Key Strengths:\n1. **Dataset Quality**: The dataset is well-constructed, geographically diverse, and temporally extensive, offering a unique 3D structure and altitude-specific measurements absent in prior work. Its public availability and reproducibility are strong positives.\n2. **Clarity and Reproducibility**: The paper is clearly written, and the dataset and code are accessible, enabling future research.\n\n### Critical Weaknesses:\n1. **Lack of Novelty**: \n   - Reviewers (especially Reviewer 3) emphasize that the dataset’s technical contributions are incremental. While it adds vertical dimensions, it does not fundamentally innovate beyond existing datasets (e.g., lack of methodological novelty in data collection or processing).\n   - The benchmarking focuses on standard baselines (e.g., optical flow, ConvLSTM) without exploring advanced models like transformers, leaving open questions about the dataset’s potential to drive breakthroughs.\n\n2. **Empirical Weaknesses**:\n   - Baseline evaluations are criticized as \"naïve\" (Reviewer 2) and insufficient. The use of MSE alone as an evaluation metric is inadequate for precipitation nowcasting, which requires metrics like SSIM, F1-score for rain/no-rain classification, or probabilistic accuracy measures.\n   - No comparisons with prior datasets (e.g., how do models perform on RuDar vs. existing benchmarks?) or cross-climate-zone evaluations are provided, weakening the dataset’s demonstrated utility.\n   - The uncertainty quantification analysis is superficial (Reviewer 3), and claims about applicability to tasks like anomaly detection lack experimental validation.\n\n3. **Significance for ICLR**:\n   - Reviewers 2 and 3 argue that the dataset’s contributions are insufficiently novel or impactful for a top conference. While the dataset is valuable, it does not propose a transformative framework, theory, or methodological breakthrough required for ICLR. Reviewer 2 explicitly suggests a journal submission instead.\n\n### Final Decision:\nThe dataset is a solid contribution to the field but lacks the technical or empirical novelty required for a top-tier conference like ICLR. The reviewers’ consensus on marginal significance (technical and empirical scores of 2–3/4) and the absence of groundbreaking insights or evaluations justify rejection. The work would be better suited for a specialized journal or venue focused on dataset releases.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

      "response": "Okay, let's tackle this. The paper is about extending neural probabilistic logic programming to handle both discrete and continuous variables, which is a big deal because existing systems like DeepProbLog are limited to discrete. The main contributions are the new language DeepSeaProbLog, its implementation with inference and learning, and some experiments.\n\nLooking at the reviewers' comments, there's a mix of positive and critical points. Reviewers 1, 3, 4, 5, 7 seem to acknowledge the novelty and importance of supporting continuous variables, which is a clear gap in current NPLP systems. Reviewer 3 mentions the work is solid and novel, while Reviewer 4 thinks it's a good extension but notes efficiency trade-offs. However, some reviewers are concerned about the empirical evaluation. Reviewer 2 points out that the applications are only toy examples and wants more benchmarks. Reviewer 3 also mentions missing comparisons in pure discrete settings and an ablation study. Reviewer 6 and 7 think the work is too incremental, especially since it's an extension of DeepProbLog, and there's confusion about how discrete variables are handled. \n\nTechnical novelty is a point of contention. Reviewer 6 says the techniques like reparameterization aren't new, and the semantics might not be sufficiently explained. Reviewer 7 mentions the paper feels too incremental and the example is not compelling. Clarity is another issue; some reviewers found the paper's explanations lacking, especially regarding the semantics and handling of discrete variables. \n\nOn the positive side, the technical correctness is generally acknowledged (most gave a 4/4), and the reproducibility seems okay with appendices. The main issues are the empirical section's limitations and the perceived incremental nature. The experiments are on three tasks, but two are existing NeSy tasks and one is a new MNIST subtraction. The reviewers want more real-world benchmarks and comparisons. Also, the lack of an ablation study in the VAE experiment is a problem. \n\nThe key question is whether the contribution is significant enough for a top-tier conference. The extension to continuous variables is a clear step forward, but if the implementation and experiments don't sufficiently demonstrate its advantages over existing methods, especially in both discrete and continuous domains, that's a problem. The reviewers' consensus seems to be that while the idea is good, the evaluation is insufficient, and the novelty might be marginal. \n\nHowever, the paper does address a significant limitation of prior work. Even if it's an extension, solving the continuous domain issue is substantial. The authors need to address the empirical shortcomings, but since this is a conference submission, the current evaluation might not be enough. But some reviewers (like 3 and 4) still recommend acceptance despite these issues. The mixed technical novelty scores (some 4s, some 3s and 2s) suggest that while the core idea is novel, the execution might not be groundbreaking. \n\nConsidering top-tier standards, the paper needs strong empirical validation and clear demonstration of superiority over baselines. The current experiments, though showing promise, are limited. The lack of comparisons in pure discrete settings and the toy applications might hold it back. However, the problem they're solving is important, and the technical approach (using WMI) is innovative. \n\nIn the end, the reviewers' recommendations lean towards acceptance but with reservations. Since the majority (Reviewers 1,3,4,5,7) are in favor with some caveats, and the main contribution is addressing a critical gap, I think the paper should be accepted but with a strong recommendation to address the empirical and clarity issues in the camera-ready version.\n</think>\n\nThe paper introduces DeepSeaProbLog, an extension of neural probabilistic logic programming (NPLP) to handle both discrete and continuous variables, addressing a key limitation of prior systems like DeepProbLog. The contributions are technically novel, particularly in enabling mixed-domain reasoning through weighted model integration (WMI) and gradient-based learning. However, the evaluation and presentation raise concerns that must be weighed against the significance of the core idea.\n\n### Key Strengths:\n1. **Technical Novelty**: The extension to continuous variables is a critical advancement for NPLP, enabling applications in real-world domains requiring hybrid reasoning. The integration of WMI and neural networks represents a meaningful step forward.\n2. **Implementation and Semantics**: The paper provides a clear framework for inference and learning, leveraging WMI and reparameterization techniques, which are well-explained in the appendices.\n3. **Empirical Validation**: While limited, the experiments (e.g., MNIST subtraction, VAE with constraints) demonstrate the system’s ability to handle tasks requiring both neural and symbolic reasoning, showcasing its potential.\n\n### Major Concerns:\n1. **Empirical Evaluation**: \n   - The experiments are confined to toy or synthetic tasks, with no comparisons to baselines in pure discrete settings. This limits the ability to assess performance trade-offs with existing systems like DeepProbLog.\n   - The MNIST subtraction task, while illustrative, lacks rigorous metrics (e.g., accuracy) and ablation studies (e.g., comparing with unconstrained baselines), weakening the empirical impact.\n   - Reviewers 2, 3, 5, and 7 highlight the need for more diverse benchmarks (e.g., TensorFlow Probability datasets) and scalability analysis.\n2. **Clarity and Presentation**:\n   - The paper defers critical details (e.g., semantics of continuous variables, handling of discrete distributions) to appendices, making the main text overly reliant on background material. This reduces accessibility for non-experts.\n   - Ambiguities in the treatment of discrete variables (e.g., reliance on Dirac deltas) and the lack of discussion on WMI solver choices (per Reviewer 3) weaken technical rigor.\n3. **Novelty Perception**:\n   - Reviewers 5, 6, and 7 question the significance of the contribution, viewing it as an incremental extension of DeepProbLog. While the core idea is novel, the presentation does not sufficiently emphasize its distinctiveness or broader implications.\n\n### Balancing the Evaluation:\n- **Top-tier Standards**: Top conferences demand both technical innovation and robust empirical validation. While the core idea is impactful, the current evaluation is insufficient to fully demonstrate its superiority or practical utility. However, the problem addressed (continuous-variable support in NPLP) is sufficiently important to warrant publication, provided the authors address key concerns in the final version.\n- **Reviewer Consensus**: Most reviewers (1, 3, 4, 5, 7) lean toward acceptance, citing the significance of the contribution despite empirical and presentation flaws. Reviewers 6 and 2 are more critical but do not outright dismiss the work. The technical correctness and reproducibility are generally affirmed.\n\n### Final Decision:\nThe paper’s core contribution—extending NPLP to continuous domains—is sufficiently novel and impactful for a top-tier conference. While the empirical evaluation and presentation require strengthening, the reviewers’ overall positive assessment and the problem’s importance justify acceptance. The authors should address the reviewers’ concerns (e.g., ablation studies, scalability analysis, clearer semantics) in the camera-ready version.\n\nFinal Decision: Accept"

      "response": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate whether this protein design paper should be accepted into a top-tier conference. Let me start by going through all the provided information step by step.\n\nFirst, the paper's title and abstract. The main contribution seems to be a new method called ProtSeed that does protein sequence and structure co-design using an equivariant translation approach. They claim it's faster than existing methods like autoregressive or diffusion models because it updates all amino acids in one shot each step. The experiments show better performance than previous SOTA, with lower inference time.\n\nNow, looking at the reviewer comments. There are eight reviewers here. Let me parse each one's points.\n\nReviewer 1 is positive, mentions the authors addressed concerns, and wants some modifications in the final version. They increased their score, so that's a good sign.\n\nReviewer 2 is brief but says they look forward to more discussions. Not a strong negative.\n\nReviewer 3 points out that the SeqIPA calculation isn't clearly presented, suggesting an algorithm box. The authors need to clarify that.\n\nReviewer 4 has a couple of points. They're okay with some revisions but question a typo in the rebuttal. Also, there's a concern about the novelty claim—specifically, whether the method is truly the first co-design approach or if others like Jin's antibody work do similar things. The reviewer also asks if the authors are conflating application novelty with technical novelty. They agree that the method's co-design approach is valid but want clarity on the \"first\" claim.\n\nReviewer 5 is more critical. They list several weaknesses: lack of hyperparameters, no code release, unclear relevance of some tasks, discrepancies in prior work results (like Diffusion model's RMSD), and concerns about evaluation metrics not reflecting functional performance. They also note that AAR scores are low, which might question the models' effectiveness. They want more functional evaluations and reproducibility details. However, they acknowledge the method's novelty and strong results but need more details and code.\n\nReviewer 6 is more negative. They give lower scores (2/4 for correctness and novelty). They argue that parts of the method are borrowed from AlphaFold2, so the novelty isn't as high as claimed. Technical concerns include unclear decoder updates, SeqIPA formulation, and training costs. They also mention the need for context features which might limit practical use, and lack of ablation studies. The reviewer thinks the contributions are only marginally novel.\n\nReviewer 7 is positive overall, noting strong empirical results and good benchmarking. They suggest comparing to newer models like ESM-IF and doing ablations, but still recommend acceptance. They think the model is novel enough with good results.\n\nReviewer 8 is also positive, saying the method is a good contribution with useful modifications over prior work. They note that \"co-design\" might be misleading since it uses contact maps from existing structures, but the method's broader application beyond antibodies is a plus. They give a correctness score of 4, the highest.\n\nNow, compiling all this. The main strengths are the strong empirical results, the novel approach (SeqIPA, equivariant decoder), and the speed advantage over diffusion models. The weaknesses include concerns about novelty (some reviewers think it's derivative of AlphaFold2), lack of implementation details (hyperparameters, code), discrepancies in prior work results, and some technical clarity issues (like SeqIPA equations). Also, the functional evaluation is lacking, and the AAR scores are low, which might question practical utility.\n\nTop-tier conferences usually require high novelty, strong technical contributions, and thorough evaluations. The paper has good results but faces criticism on novelty and reproducibility. The reviewers are split: some (like 1, 3, 4, 7, 8) are leaning towards accept with revisions, while 5 and 6 have more reservations. However, the majority seem to support acceptance, especially since the empirical results are strong and the method addresses a key problem (speed). The authors need to address the technical clarity issues (like SeqIPA equations), provide more details, release code, and maybe do ablations. The novelty concern is there, but if the method is indeed faster and better, that's a significant contribution even if building on prior work. The functional evaluation is a valid point, but maybe the reviewers who are positive think the current metrics are sufficient for the conference's standards.\n\nConsidering all, the paper has enough strengths and the issues can be addressed in the final version. The reviewers' recommendations (except maybe 6) are towards acceptance. So, I think the decision should be to accept, provided the authors make the necessary revisions.\n</think>\n\nThe paper proposes ProtSeed, a novel method for protein sequence-structure co-design that addresses computational inefficiencies of existing approaches (e.g., autoregressive and diffusion models) by enabling one-shot updates of amino acids during inference. The method combines a trigonometry-aware encoder and a roto-translation equivariant decoder, achieving strong empirical results across multiple benchmarks. While the reviewers highlight several strengths, including clear motivation, strong empirical performance, and the potential impact of faster inference, they also raise critical concerns about novelty, reproducibility, and technical clarity. Below is a structured analysis:\n\n### **Strengths**\n1. **Empirical Performance**: The paper demonstrates significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines (e.g., Diffusion, GVP-GNN) in terms of metrics like PPL, RMSD, and AAR. The speed advantage over sampling-based methods is compelling for practical applications.\n2. **Technical Approach**: The use of an equivariant decoder and iterative refinement distinguishes the method from prior work. The SeqIPA module is a novel extension of the IPA architecture, tailored for co-design tasks.\n3. **Relevance**: Protein co-design is a critical problem in bioengineering, and the method’s ability to generate high-fidelity sequences and structures addresses a key challenge in the field.\n4. **Clarity and Presentation**: Most reviewers praise the writing and experimental setup, with clear motivation and benchmarking against relevant baselines.\n\n### **Weaknesses and Concerns**\n1. **Novelty**: \n   - Reviewers 4, 6, and 8 question the technical novelty, noting that core components (e.g., IPA modules) are borrowed from AlphaFold2. While the application to co-design is novel, the method’s technical innovations are incremental.\n   - The claim of being the \"first\" co-design method is contested, as prior work (e.g., Jin’s antibody design) achieves similar goals. The authors must clarify the distinction in technical contributions.\n2. **Reproducibility**:\n   - Lack of hyperparameter details, training procedures, and code availability hinders reproducibility. Reviewer 5 and 6 emphasize this as a critical flaw for a top-tier conference.\n   - The discrepancy in prior work results (e.g., Diffusion model’s RMSD) requires clarification to ensure fair comparisons.\n3. **Technical Clarity**:\n   - The SeqIPA formulation is inadequately described in the main text (Reviewer 3, 6). An algorithm box or equations are needed for clarity.\n   - The decoder’s treatment of context features and predicted amino acids (e.g., handling of $z$ and $m$ features) is unclear (Reviewer 6).\n4. **Evaluation Limitations**:\n   - Functional metrics (e.g., protein-protein interactions, charge distributions) are missing, relying instead on structural metrics like RMSD. This limits confidence in real-world utility.\n   - Low AAR scores (<40%) across methods raise questions about the practical relevance of the results.\n   - The term \"co-design\" is misleading for some tasks (e.g., fixed-backbone design requires pre-specified contact maps), as noted by Reviewer 8.\n5. **Implementation Details**:\n   - Training costs and computational requirements are not discussed, which is critical for assessing scalability.\n   - Ablation studies are absent, making it difficult to isolate contributions of individual components (e.g., trigonometry-aware encoder vs. equivariant decoder).\n\n### **Reviewer Consensus**\n- **Positive Aspects**: Most reviewers (1, 3, 4, 7, 8) acknowledge the method’s empirical strengths and potential impact. Reviewers 7 and 8 explicitly recommend acceptance.\n- **Critical Concerns**: Reviewers 5 and 6 highlight reproducibility gaps, novelty limitations, and technical ambiguities. However, these issues are addressable in the final version (e.g., adding hyperparameters, code, and SeqIPA details).\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWhile the paper faces valid criticisms regarding novelty and reproducibility, its strong empirical results, computational efficiency, and clear application to a critical problem in bioengineering make it a candidate for acceptance. The authors must address the following in the final version:\n1. **Technical Clarity**: Provide explicit equations for SeqIPA, clarify decoder mechanics, and include an algorithm box.\n2. **Reproducibility**: Release code, detail hyperparameters, and resolve discrepancies with prior work.\n3. **Novelty**: Refine claims to distinguish from AlphaFold2 and prior co-design methods (e.g., Jin’s work).\n4. **Evaluation**: Add functional metrics and address the AAR scores’ implications.\n\nThe method’s speed and performance improvements over existing approaches, combined with its potential impact on protein design, outweigh the incremental technical contributions. Addressing the reviewers’ concerns will strengthen the paper’s case for publication at a top-tier conference.\n\nFinal Decision: Accept"

      "response": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to act as an expert reviewer for a top-tier conference and decide whether to accept or reject this paper. Let me start by going through all the provided information carefully.\n\nFirst, the paper's title is \"Convergence is Not Enough: Average-Case Performance of No-Regret Learning Dynamics.\" The abstract mentions studying q-replicator dynamics (QRD) in potential games, focusing on how these dynamics not only converge to equilibria but also select good ones. The main contributions are quantifying average performance metrics that consider regions of attraction and equilibrium quality, with experiments comparing gradient descent and standard replicator dynamics in games with tough equilibrium selection. They also mention extending results to all QRD dynamics empirically.\n\nNow, looking at the reviewer comments. There are four reviewers. Let me parse each one.\n\nReviewer 1: They acknowledge the paper's contribution but note that prior work like PP16 had started similar studies. The formal results are partial. They point out minor issues like the use of \"whenever\" vs \"if and only if\" in Theorem 4.4, citation formatting, and confusion about monotonicity terms. However, they're open to accepting after considering others.\n\nReviewer 2: Initially wanted to reject because the paper didn't sufficiently engage with PP16, which they see as a key prior work. The paper's results are seen as incremental, especially since Theorem 3.2 is a generalization of PP16's work. The applications (Theorems 4.4/4.6) are limited to 2x2 games. They also note some undefined terms and lack of discussion with PP16. But after discussion, they're satisfied with added comparisons and raised their score. However, they still rate technical novelty as low (2 out of 4?).\n\nReviewer 3: The paper is well-written but the results are partial. The main results are for 2x2 games, and even there, the theorems don't cover all cases (like α < 0.5). They mention that the invariant function in Lemma 4.5 is only empirical, not proven, and there's no generalization to higher dimensions. The abstract is misleading because it doesn't specify the 2x2 focus. Formatting and notation issues are noted. They suggest it's a good start but needs more formal results to be accepted.\n\nReviewer 4: Thinks the problem is important and the paper is well-written. The results for 2x2 games are significant, but the weakness is the restriction to that case. Post-rebuttal, they agree the paper should clarify it's not the first on average-case performance and that the class of games has unbounded PoA. They also note the audience might be better suited for EC, but still recommend acceptance, though lowering their score to a 7 (if possible).\n\nSo, compiling all this:\n\nStrengths:\n- The problem is important (equilibrium selection in learning dynamics).\n- The paper is well-written and clear.\n- The 2x2 case results, while limited, are a starting point.\n- Reviewers 3 and 4 acknowledge the problem's significance and the paper's potential.\n\nWeaknesses:\n- Incremental compared to PP16, especially since the main theorems are generalizations but still limited in scope.\n- The results are partial, especially in not covering all cases (e.g., α < 0.5, other q values, higher dimensions).\n- Lack of sufficient engagement with prior work initially, though addressed post-rebuttal.\n- The abstract overstates the generality of the results (should mention 2x2 focus).\n- Technical novelty is considered low by some reviewers (2/4 on technical novelty by R2 and R3).\n\nTop-tier conferences usually require high novelty and significant contributions. The paper's main contributions are in a specific case (2x2 games) and extend PP16 but don't break new ground beyond that. The reviewers' scores on technical significance are mixed, with R4 giving a 4 but others lower. However, after rebuttal, R2 and R4 adjusted their stance, but the novelty is still seen as marginal.\n\nThe key issue is whether the contribution is sufficient for a top conference. Since the results are limited to 2x2 and the framework's extension isn't proven, it might be more suitable for a specialized conference like EC. However, the problem's importance and the initial framework could still merit acceptance if the community values the direction. But given the reviewers' consensus on incremental nature and limited scope, especially after R2's initial rejection stance, it's a tough call.\n\nBut looking at the final decisions from reviewers: R1 is on the fence, R2 raised their score but still thinks novelty is low, R3 wants more results but acknowledges potential, R4 recommends acceptance but with lower score. The conference's standards are high, so maybe the paper is borderline. However, since some reviewers (especially R2 and R3) point out that the results are partial and the contribution is marginal, and the problem is already addressed in prior work (PP16), perhaps it's better suited for a more specialized venue. But since R4 and others still recommend acceptance, maybe the community's interest in the problem justifies it.\n\nWait, the final decision from R2 after discussion was to raise the score, but their technical novelty was 2. R4's technical novelty was 4, but others lower. The average might be borderline. However, top conferences often require higher novelty. Since the main results are in 2x2 and the framework isn't fully developed, maybe it's better to reject. But the problem's importance and the initial framework could push towards accept. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the reviewers' post-rebuttal adjustments might tip it towards accept. R2 and R4 are more positive after considering the rebuttal. The paper does address the PP16 comparison, and the problem is important. The 2x2 case is a good starting point, even if limited. Since the conference allows for promising work, maybe accept. But the technical novelty is a concern. The authors might need to clarify the abstract and contributions better, but the reviewers seem to think it's acceptable now.\n\nFinal Decision: Accept, but with the caveat that the paper is on the borderline. However, since some reviewers (especially R4) recommend acceptance and the problem is significant, and the issues were addressed post-rebuttal, I think the consensus leans towards accept.\n</think>\n\nThe paper addresses an important problem in game theory and learning dynamics by exploring the average-case performance of no-regret learning algorithms, specifically focusing on q-replicator dynamics (QRD). While the problem is well-motivated and the technical contributions are correct, the reviewers' feedback highlights critical limitations. \n\n**Key Strengths:**\n1. **Problem Relevance:** The study of equilibrium selection and average performance in learning dynamics is significant, and the paper provides a framework for comparing dynamics in potential games.\n2. **Partial Results:** The analysis of 2x2 coordination games offers foundational insights, and the empirical comparisons between gradient descent and replicator dynamics are valuable.\n3. **Clarity and Writing:** The paper is well-written and accessible, with clear explanations of concepts and motivations.\n\n**Key Weaknesses:**\n1. **Novelty and Incremental Nature:** The work builds on prior results (e.g., PP16) but is seen as incremental. The generalization to QRD is limited to specific cases (e.g., 2x2 games), and the theoretical results do not fully address broader classes of games or dynamics.\n2. **Scope Limitations:** The main results are restricted to 2x2 symmetric games, and even within this setting, key cases (e.g., α < 0.5) remain unaddressed. The abstract overstates the generality of the findings.\n3. **Lack of Generalization:** The framework’s extension to higher dimensions or other game classes is not rigorously demonstrated, leaving its broader applicability uncertain.\n4. **Prior Work Engagement:** Initial shortcomings in discussing PP16 were addressed post-rebuttal, but the contribution’s novelty remains marginal compared to existing literature.\n\n**Reviewer Consensus:**\n- **Technical Novelty:** Most reviewers rated technical significance as low (2/4), though Reviewer 4 found the problem itself significant.\n- **Acceptance Debate:** While Reviewer 4 and others acknowledged the problem’s importance and adjusted their stance post-rebuttal, concerns about incremental progress and limited scope persisted. Reviewer 2’s initial rejection stance softened but remained critical of the paper’s novelty.\n\n**Final Judgment:**  \nThe paper’s contributions, while valid, are constrained by its narrow scope and incremental nature relative to prior work. Top-tier conferences typically require more substantial breakthroughs or broader applicability. The 2x2 case is a promising start, but the lack of generalization and incomplete analysis in even this restricted setting weaken its impact. The problem’s importance and the framework’s potential may justify acceptance in a specialized venue (e.g., EC), but for a top-tier conference, the limitations outweigh the contributions.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"
