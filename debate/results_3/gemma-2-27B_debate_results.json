While the proposed idea of using a meta-MCTS to control episode generation in reinforcement learning has some potential merit, the paper's severe shortcomings outweigh any potential contribution.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the reasons:\n\n* **Poor Writing Quality:** All three reviewers unanimously criticized the paper's writing quality. The abstract is incomprehensible, sentences are grammatically incorrect, and the overall structure lacks clarity. This makes it extremely difficult to understand the authors' proposed method and its significance.\n\n* **Lack of References:** The absence of any references is a major red flag. It suggests a lack of engagement with existing literature and raises concerns about the originality of the proposed work.\n\n* **Unclear Methodology:** The description of the proposed method is vague and difficult to follow. The reviewers struggled to understand how the meta-MCTS is implemented and how it interacts with the main MCTS agent.\n\n* **Insufficient Evidence:** The paper only presents results on a small problem (tic-tac-toe), which is insufficient to demonstrate the method's effectiveness in more complex domains.\n\n* **Unprofessional Tone:** The author's response to the reviews, while acknowledging the shortcomings, lacks a professional tone and does not demonstrate a clear understanding of the issues raised.\n\n**While the authors express a desire to improve their writing and research, the current state of the paper is far from publishable in a top-tier conference.** The fundamental issues with clarity, structure, and evidence require significant revision before the paper can be considered for publication.\n\n\n**Final Decision: Reject**"

The lack of clarity, weak theoretical justification, and limited scope prevent the paper from being accepted. The authors need to significantly improve the clarity of their arguments and provide stronger theoretical support for their claims.\n\n**Recommendations for Improvement:**\n\n* **Improve Clarity:** Rewrite Section 4 to be more concise and accessible. Clearly define all terms and provide intuitive explanations for the proposed regularizers.\n* **Strengthen Theoretical Analysis:** Provide a more rigorous analysis of why the proposed regularizers lead to tighter bounds. Consider using illustrative examples and concrete examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.\n* **Expand Experiments:** Evaluate the proposed method on more complex datasets and compare it to a wider range of baseline methods.\n\nBy addressing these weaknesses, the authors can significantly improve the quality of the paper."

While the idea of using a meta-learner to optimize parameter updates is interesting and potentially valuable, several issues prevent me from recommending acceptance at this stage.\n\n**Reasons for Potential Rejection:**\n\n* **Limited Novelty:** The core idea of using an LSTM to control parameter updates is not entirely novel. As the reviewers point out, Ravi & Larochelle's Meta-Learner LSTM shares similarities with NORML. The paper needs to clearly articulate the key differences and advantages of NORML over existing approaches, ideally with a direct comparison.\n* **Insufficient Experimental Validation:** The experimental results are not convincing enough. The paper lacks a direct comparison with Meta-Learner LSTM using the same experimental setup. Additionally, the choice of baselines and datasets is limited. Comparing NORML with MAML variants like MAML++ and conducting experiments on miniImageNet would strengthen the evaluation.\n* **Limited Applicability:** NORML's focus on fully connected networks restricts its applicability to a narrower range of tasks compared to methods that can handle convolutional networks.\n* **Inaccuracies in Related Work:** The paper contains inaccuracies regarding previous work, particularly concerning the scaling properties of Meta-Learner LSTM and Andrychowicz et al.'s approach. These inaccuracies need to be corrected.\n* **Writing Quality:** As Reviewer 2 points out, the writing quality needs significant improvement. There are grammatical errors, inconsistent citations, and unclear phrasing that hinder readability.\n\n**Potential for Improvement:**\n\nThe paper has potential if the authors address the aforementioned issues. A revised version should:\n\n* Provide a clearer and more detailed comparison with Meta-Learner LSTM, including a direct experimental comparison.\n* Expand the experimental evaluation to include more relevant baselines and datasets.\n* Address the inaccuracies in the related work section.\n* Improve the writing quality and clarity.\n* Explore the possibility of extending NORML to handle convolutional networks.\n\n**Final Decision: Reject**\n\nWhile the paper presents an interesting idea, the lack of novelty, insufficient experimental validation, and inaccuracies in the related work section warrant rejection at this stage. The authors should address the reviewers' concerns and consider a resubmission after significant revisions."

The authors provide a theoretical analysis focusing on the minimum eigenvalue of a Gram matrix (G-matrix), which is crucial for determining the convergence rate of training in the lazy regime (small learning rate).\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Novel Contributions:** The paper makes several novel contributions. It shows that for non-smooth activations (like ReLU), the minimum eigenvalue of the G-matrix is large under reasonable data assumptions, improving upon previous work. Conversely, for smooth activations (like tanh, swish), the minimum eigenvalue can be exponentially small if the data has low-dimensional structure or the network is sufficiently deep.\n* **Rigorous Analysis:** The paper presents a rigorous theoretical analysis, backed by detailed proofs (provided in the appendix). The authors clearly state their assumptions and derive insightful bounds on the eigenvalues.\n* **Empirical Validation:** The authors validate their theoretical findings with experiments on synthetic data and CIFAR10. While there are some discrepancies between theory and experiment for CIFAR10 with smooth activations, the results generally support the theoretical claims.\n* **Well-Written and Organized:** The paper is well-written and organized, making it relatively easy to follow the main arguments and results.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Lengthy Appendix:** As the reviewers pointed out, the appendix is quite extensive.

This is a valuable contribution to the theoretical understanding of GAN training.\n* **Clear Presentation:** The paper is well-written and the mathematical arguments are presented clearly.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Limited Scope:** The analysis is restricted to one-layer generators and simplified discriminators (rectified linear and quadratic). While this simplification allows for theoretical tractability, it raises concerns about the practical relevance of the results.\n\n* **Questionable Generalizability:** The authors argue that their choice of discriminator is sufficient for learning the target distribution. However, the simplified discriminators lack the expressive power of typical neural network discriminators used in practice. This raises doubts about whether the theoretical findings generalize to real-world WGAN training.\n\n* **Lack of Empirical Validation:** The paper lacks strong empirical validation of its theoretical claims. While the authors mention experiments, they do not provide sufficient details or results to support their claims.\n\n* **Unclear Contribution:** The paper's title and abstract overstate the contribution.

      "response": "## Analysis\n\nThis paper proposes a novel approach to adversarial training called Collaborative Adversarial Training (CAT). The core idea is to train two robust models simultaneously, each using a different adversarial training method, and leverage the logits of one model to guide the training of the other. While the concept is interesting and the paper is well-written, several concerns arise:\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Novelty:** The idea of collaborative adversarial training, while inspired by ensemble methods, is a novel approach to combining the strengths of different adversarial training techniques.\n* **Empirical Results:** CAT demonstrates improved robustness compared to baseline methods on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Lack of Theoretical Analysis:** The paper lacks a theoretical justification for why CAT improves robustness. A deeper analysis of how the collaboration between models leads to better generalization against adversarial attacks would strengthen the contribution.\n* **Computational Cost:** Training two models simultaneously doubles the computational cost and memory requirements, which is a significant drawback. The authors should address this limitation and explore potential optimizations.\n* **Limited Scope:** The evaluation is limited to CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets and a few network architectures. Experiments on larger datasets and diverse architectures are needed to demonstrate the generalizability of CAT.\n* **Missing Baselines:** The paper omits several important baselines, including recent and stronger adversarial training methods. A more comprehensive comparison is necessary to assess the true effectiveness of CAT.\n* **Lack of Ablation Studies:** The paper lacks ablation studies to investigate the impact of different design choices, such as the number of models, the specific adversarial training methods used, and the influence of the logit guidance mechanism.\n\n**Reviewer Comments:**\n\nThe reviewers raise similar concerns regarding novelty, theoretical justification, computational cost, and the need for more extensive experiments and comparisons.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nWhile CAT presents a promising idea for improving adversarial robustness, the paper suffers from several weaknesses that prevent it from being accepted in its current form. The lack of theoretical analysis, limited scope, and missing baselines weaken the contribution.\n\n**Final Decision: Reject**\n\nThe authors should address the reviewers' concerns and conduct further experiments to strengthen their claims before resubmitting the paper."

The core idea of using a bi-objective optimization model to balance skill level and play style diversity is novel and potentially valuable.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Clear Problem Statement:** The paper clearly identifies the challenge of generating diverse playing styles in self-play RL and proposes a solution using a bi-objective optimization framework.\n* **Well-Defined Methodology:** The proposed algorithm is well-explained and appears to be technically sound. The use of NSGA-II as a basis for the evolutionary algorithm is a sensible choice.\n* **Promising Empirical Results:** The experiments in Pong and Justice Online demonstrate that the proposed BiO algorithm can achieve competitive performance while generating agents with diverse playing styles.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Limited Scope of Experiments:** The evaluation is limited to two games, one of which (Pong) is relatively simple. More diverse and challenging benchmark domains are needed to demonstrate the generalizability of the approach.\n* **Lack of Comparison to Quality-Diversity Algorithms:** The paper fails to compare BiO to established quality-diversity algorithms, which are directly relevant to the problem addressed. This omission weakens the novelty and significance claims.\n* **Insufficient Analysis of Play Style Diversity:** The paper relies on a single scalar metric to quantify play style, which may be overly simplistic. A more nuanced analysis of the diversity of learned play styles is needed.\n* **Missing Details in Experimental Setup:** Some details regarding the experimental setup are unclear, such as the opponent selection process in RQ3 and the specific definition of \"different environments\" in Justice Online.\n\n**Reviewer Comments:**\n\nThe reviewer comments highlight several important concerns, particularly regarding the lack of comparison to quality-diversity algorithms and the limited scope of the experiments. The authors did not provide a response to address these concerns.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nWhile the paper presents a promising approach to encourage diverse playing styles in self-play RL, the lack of a comprehensive evaluation and comparison to existing methods weakens its contribution.
