The paper proposes two regularizers that can be used to train neural networks that yield convex relaxations with tighter bounds, which is a significant contribution to the field of adversarial robustness.\n2. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed regularizations result in tighter certification bounds than non-regularized baselines, which is a promising result.\n3. The authors have addressed several concerns raised by the reviewers, including clarifying the mechanism of their regularizer, providing additional experimental results, and revising the paper to improve its clarity and coherence.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n1. The analysis section is still somewhat confusing, and the authors could benefit from providing more intuitive explanations of their regularizers and how they work.\n2. The experimental results, while promising, are not entirely convincing due to the lack of certain baselines, such as the optimal convex relaxation method.\n3. The authors could have done a better job of addressing the concerns raised by Reviewer 2, particularly with regards to the theoretical justification of their regularizer and the potential limitations of their approach.\n\nOverall, I believe that the paper has made significant progress in addressing the concerns raised by the reviewers, and the authors have provided a clear and concise response to the feedback.

The authors' response acknowledges this issue but does not provide a clear explanation for why their work is distinct.\n2. **Methodological limitations:** Reviewer 1 and 3 point out that the paper lacks a clear explanation of the data and methods used. The authors' response provides some clarification, but the paper still requires more detail on data preprocessing, feature representation, and model hyperparameters.\n3. **Evaluation metrics:** Reviewer 1 and 3 suggest that the paper's evaluation metrics are limited and do not provide a comprehensive picture of the models' performance. The authors' response adds some additional metrics, but the paper still requires more thorough evaluation.\n4. **Generalizability:** Reviewer 1 raises concerns about the paper's generalizability to other Hi-C datasets and epigenetic features. The authors' response acknowledges this limitation but does not provide a clear explanation for why their approach is not generalizable.\n5. **Lack of discussion:** Reviewer 2 points out that the paper lacks a discussion on the advantages and disadvantages of using regression versus neural networks for this application. The authors' response provides some additional discussion, but the paper still requires more in-depth analysis.\n\n**Author responses:**\n\nThe authors have provided detailed responses to the reviewers' comments, addressing many of the concerns raised. However, some issues remain unresolved, such as the lack of novelty and methodological limitations.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWhile the paper presents an interesting application of machine learning to predict DNA folding patterns, it has several limitations that need to be addressed. The lack of novelty, methodological limitations, and limited evaluation metrics are significant concerns that need to be resolved. The authors' responses have provided some clarification, but the paper still requires more detail and thorough evaluation.\n\n**Final Decision:** Reject\n\nThe paper has potential, but it requires significant revisions to address the concerns raised by the reviewers. The authors need to provide more detail on the data and methods used, evaluate their approach more comprehensively, and address the limitations of their work. With revisions, the paper may be considered for publication in a top-tier conference."

The clarity of the paper is compromised by several issues, including:\n\t* Confusing notation and terminology (e.g., \"primal inference,\" \"privileged information\").\n\t* Unclear explanations of key concepts (e.g., the task-dependent objective G(τ)).\n\t* Undefined loss functions (e.g., ℒmi, ℒD_KL).\n3. The related work section is incomplete, with several key areas requiring citations (e.g., meta-IL, posterior sampling with meta-RL).\n4. The experiments are limited, with only a few tasks evaluated, and the behavior cloning baseline with noisy demonstrations is not a fair comparison.\n\n**Reviewer comments:**\n\n1. Reviewer 1 raises several concerns about the complexity of the method, the necessity of all the components, and the notation and mathematical formulation.\n2. Reviewer 2 points out several issues with the related work section, including the lack of citation for similar context-conditional meta-learning methods.\n3. Reviewer 3 raises concerns about the clarity of the paper, the treatment of prior work, and the experiments.\n4. Reviewer 4 recommends rejection due to the strong assumption, clarity issues, and lack of related work citations.\n\n**Author responses:**\n\n1. The authors address some of the reviewer comments, but not all of them.\n2. They provide additional explanations and clarifications, but some of the issues remain unclear.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, I conclude that the paper has several strengths, but also significant weaknesses. While the proposed approach is promising, the paper's clarity and related work sections are compromised by several issues. The strong assumption and limited experiments also raise concerns. Considering the reviewer comments and author responses, I recommend **REJECTION** for publication in a top-tier conference.\n\nFinal Decision: Reject"

The paper addresses an important problem in deep learning, namely, the issue of over-confident predictions on out-of-distribution (OOD) data.\n2. The proposed methods, Single Image and Multiple Image Method, are novel and seem to be effective in improving calibration on OOD data.\n3. The experiments demonstrate that the methods can consistently improve calibration across different corruptions.\n4. The paper provides a clear and concise introduction to the problem and the proposed methods.\n\nWeaknesses of the paper:\n\n1. The paper relies on a pre-specified set of corruptions to generate the validation data, which may not be generalizable to other types of corruptions.\n2. The results are only reported when the validation corruption is \"Contrast\", and it would be interesting to see how the method performs on other types of corruptions.\n3. The paper does not provide a clear explanation of why the \"Multiple Image Method\" is used, and how it can be sure that the images come from the same distribution.\n4. The notation is not always clear, and some equations are not well-defined.\n5. The paper does not provide a thorough evaluation of the method on completely OOD data, such as using SVHN dataset for testing predictions of a model that was trained on CIFAR-10.\n\nReviewer comments and author responses:\n\n1. Reviewer 1 pointed out that the approach assumes the possible novel distributions are known, which is not assumed in existing work. However, the authors clarified that they do not assume to know which \"unknown distribution\" the novel image is from, but rather use a pre-specified set of corruptions to generate the validation data.\n2. Reviewer 2 suggested that the motivation for the \"Multiple Image Method\" is less clear and that a weighted averaging approach could be used instead. The authors responded that they do compare the distribution of pmax values, but use the mean instead of KL-divergence for simplicity.\n3. Reviewer 3 pointed out that the terminology is ill-defined and that the notation is not always clear. The authors responded by clarifying the terminology and notation, and providing additional explanations in the revised version of the paper.\n4. Reviewer 4 suggested that the paper would be more interesting if it showed calibration advantages on more than just artificially corrupted sets. The authors responded by adding results on completely OOD data, such as using SVHN dataset for testing predictions of a model that was trained on CIFAR-10.\n\nBased on the above analysis, I conclude that the paper has some strengths, but also some weaknesses that need to be addressed. The paper provides a clear and concise introduction to the problem and the proposed methods, and the experiments demonstrate that the methods can consistently improve calibration across different corruptions.

The paper provides a novel and significant contribution to the field of neural networks, specifically for two-layer ReLU networks. The authors prove that finding all globally optimal solutions can be performed by solving a convex optimization program with cone constraints.\n2. The paper introduces a new concept of \"nearly minimal\" neural networks, which provides a simple structure for the set of 2-layer ReLU neural networks and is directly related to the solutions to the convex program.\n3. The authors provide a polynomial-time algorithm for checking if a neural network is globally optimal, which is a significant result.\n4. The paper establishes that Clarke stationary points found by stochastic gradient descent correspond to the global optimum of a subsampled convex problem, which provides insight into the behavior of gradient descent.\n\nWeaknesses and limitations:\n\n1. The paper only considers two-layer ReLU networks, which is a limitation. However, the authors provide a clear explanation of why this is the case and mention that they are working on extending the results to deep neural networks.\n2. The paper relies on the convex optimization formulation of the regularized training problem, which may not be directly applicable to other activation functions. However, the authors mention that they are working on extending the method to other activation functions.\n\nReviewer comments:\n\n1. Reviewer 1 provides a detailed and balanced review, highlighting both the strengths and weaknesses of the paper.\n2. Reviewer 2 provides a very positive review, highlighting the significance and novelty of the paper.\n3. Reviewer 3 provides a more critical review, pointing out that the paper builds on previous work and that the results may not be directly applicable to deep neural networks.\n4.

This phenomenon is observed in various tasks and architectures, making it a relevant and timely research topic.\n2. **Empirical validation**: The authors provide empirical evidence to support their claims, including experiments on multiple datasets and tasks. The results show that the proposed method, balanced multi-modal learning, improves the model's generalization performance and reduces the greedy behavior.\n3. **Methodological contributions**: The paper introduces a new metric, conditional learning speed, to measure the imbalance in modality utilization. The authors also propose a training algorithm, balanced multi-modal learning, to address the issue of greedy learning.\n4. **Weaknesses and limitations**: Reviewers have pointed out several weaknesses and limitations, including:\n\t* Lack of theoretical analysis to support the greedy learner hypothesis.\n\t* Insufficient comparison with other methods that solve the imbalance problem.\n\t* Limited discussion of related work and comparison with state-of-the-art methods.\n\t* Lack of ablation study on the hyperparameters introduced in the proposed algorithm.\n\t* Limited evaluation on datasets with natural modalities (e.g., audio-visual datasets).\n5. **Author responses**: The authors have addressed some of the concerns raised by the reviewers, including providing additional experimental results, clarifying the re-balancing step, and discussing the limitations of their work.\n\nConsidering these points, I believe that the paper has made significant contributions to the field of multi-modal learning, and the authors have addressed some of the concerns raised by the reviewers. However, there are still some weaknesses and limitations that need to be addressed.\n\n**Final Decision: Accept**\n\nI recommend accepting the paper for publication, subject to the authors addressing the remaining concerns and weaknesses. The authors should provide a more thorough theoretical analysis to support the greedy learner hypothesis, compare their method with other state-of-the-art methods, and conduct a more comprehensive ablation study on the hyperparameters. Additionally, they should evaluate their method on datasets with natural modalities and provide a more detailed discussion of the related work. With these improvements, the paper will be more comprehensive and impactful, and its contributions will be more clearly established."

The paper presents novel and elegant theoretical results on the average error of the solution space, which is a significant contribution to the field.\n2. The authors develop new technical tools to analytically bound and consistently estimate the average test error of the neural network-Gaussian process (NNGP) posterior, which is a valuable contribution.\n3. The paper explores the connection between large margin functions and generalization, which is an important area of research.\n4. The authors provide a clear and well-written paper that is easy to follow.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n1. The experimental evaluation is limited, and the authors rely on a specific setting (Nero optimizer, mini-batching, and learning rate decay) that may not be representative of the general case.\n2. The analysis of the implicit bias of gradient descent is not rigorous and may be misleading, as pointed out by Reviewer 5.\n3. The paper overpromises analysis of both the implicit bias of neural architecture and the implicit bias of gradient descent, while providing only analysis of the implicit bias of neural architecture under a Gaussian process.\n4. The bounds obtained by the theoretical derivation are only slightly better than chance, and there is a significant gap between the bounds and empirical results.\n5. The paper does not provide a comprehensive comparison of different architectures, and the comparison between depth 2 and 7 is preliminary.\n\n**Reviewer comments:**\n\n1. Reviewer 1 finds the paper interesting but notes that the experiments show the bounds are very loose and do not have much practical significance.\n2. Reviewer 2 agrees that the paper is interesting but notes that the implicit bias of GD is more appropriately described as the implicit bias of overfitting.\n3. Reviewer 3 finds the paper premature in its current form and suggests that more concise writing, focusing only on the implicit bias of NNGP, with more comprehensive experiments would be a good submission worthy of publication.\n4. Reviewer 4 finds the paper's claims about margin to be not rigorous and raises doubts on the validity of the entire submission.\n5. Reviewer 5 agrees that the paper contains interesting theoretical results but notes that the experiments are limited and the analysis of the implicit bias of gradient descent is not rigorous.\n6. Reviewer 6 finds the paper overpromises analysis of both the implicit bias of neural architecture and the implicit bias of gradient descent, while providing only analysis of the implicit bias of neural architecture under a Gaussian process.\n7. Reviewer 7 finds the paper's main finding, namely the huge disparity between the GD NN and NNGP in section 5.2, to be novel and thought-provoking but notes that the experimental evidence is limited.\n8. Reviewer 8 finds the paper's main contribution to be incremental and notes that the rest of the analysis does not provide novel and relevant insights.\n9. Reviewer 9 finds the paper to be well-written and easy to follow but notes that the experimental validation could be improved.\n\n**Author responses:**\n\n1. The authors clarify that the language surrounding the \"implicit bias of gradient descent\" might be misleading and plan to revise it for clarity.\n2. The authors respond to Reviewer 5's concerns about the analysis of the implicit bias of gradient descent and clarify that they are not claiming that gradient descent maximizes margin in all cases.\n3. The authors respond to Reviewer 7's concerns about the experimental evidence and clarify that their claim is that large margin functions generalise better for both NNGP and GD-trained neural nets.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the strengths and weaknesses of the paper, as well as the reviewer comments and author responses, I conclude that the paper should be **Rejected** for publication at a top-tier conference.

The paper demonstrates competitive performance on the LSUN dataset, with AUROC scores of 97.95% and 98.79% for far-OOD and near-OOD detection, respectively.\n3. The authors provide a clear and concise abstract and introduction, which sets the stage for the rest of the paper.\n\n**Weaknesses of the paper:**\n\n1. The paper lacks a clear and rigorous definition of the terms \"Common sense\" and \"computational models that mimic child cognition,\" which are used to motivate the proposed method.\n2. The authors do not provide a detailed description of the feature extraction procedure, including an example that guides the reader through image->object detection->graph creation steps using actual data.\n3. The paper relies on a pre-trained object detection network that contains sufficient semantic information for the in-distribution data, which may not be the case for all datasets (e.g., medical images).\n4. The experimental section is limited, and the authors do not compare their method to other state-of-the-art methods for OOD detection.\n5. The paper lacks ablation studies, such as how the graph affects the results, and the authors do not provide an analysis of how the object detector's accuracy impacts the current model.\n6. The paper has several grammatical mistakes, which make it difficult to understand.\n\n**Reviewer comments:**\n\nAll reviewers agree that the paper has some strengths, but also several weaknesses. Reviewer 1 suggests that the authors provide a more detailed description of the feature extraction procedure and compare their method to other low-dimensional projection techniques. Reviewer 2 recommends a strong reject due to the paper's poor writing, lack of clear notation, and failure to compare to existing state-of-the-art methods.

However, several reviewers have pointed out that the bound is not tighter than the existing bound in TRADES for binary classification problems, and the extension to multi-classification problems is not well-motivated. The authors have acknowledged these concerns and revised the manuscript to focus on multi-classification problems.\n2. **Experimental results**: The paper presents extensive experimental results, which show that the proposed method, ARoW, outperforms existing methods in terms of robust accuracy. However, some reviewers have pointed out that the improvements are marginal, and the results for the case of extra data are not convincing. The authors have provided additional results to address these concerns.\n3. **Implementation and fairness**: The authors have highlighted the ease of implementation of ARoW compared to HAT and its improved fairness on class-wise robustness.\n4. **Reviewer comments**: Several reviewers have raised concerns about the clarity and rigor of the theoretical part, particularly the definition of $z(x)$ and the derivation of the upper bound. The authors have provided a revised definition of $z(x)$ and clarified the meaning of the upper bound.\n\nConsidering these points, I believe that the paper has made significant progress in addressing the concerns raised by the reviewers. However, I still have some reservations about the theoretical contribution and the experimental results.\n\n**Detailed reasoning**:\n\n* The paper's theoretical contribution is not as strong as initially claimed, and the extension to multi-classification problems is not well-motivated.\n* The experimental results show that ARoW outperforms existing methods, but the improvements are marginal, and the results for the case of extra data are not convincing.\n* The authors have addressed some of the concerns raised by the reviewers, but some issues remain, such as the clarity and rigor of the theoretical part.\n\n**Final Decision**: Accept\n\nI recommend accepting the paper for publication, subject to minor revisions to address the remaining concerns.

Additionally, the style results show some diversity, but in a relatively narrow sense, and the lack of a breadth of empirical results makes it hard to see the results as robust to a wide variety of competitive RL tasks.\n\n**Final Decision:**\n\nAccept, but with major revisions.\n\nThe paper has potential, but it needs significant revisions to address the weaknesses mentioned above. The authors should:\n\n1. Include a discussion of the work by Lanctot et al. (2017) and its relevance to the proposed method.\n2. Revise the experimental design to avoid giving an advantage to EMOGI and BiO.\n3. Address the simplification of \"playing style\" to a single scalar and discuss its limitations.\n4. Include baselines from quality-diversity algorithms, such as MAP-Elites.\n5. Conduct more rigorous comparisons with a wider range of evaluation domains.\n6. Provide more details on the style results, including plots for more agents and a discussion of the diversity of playing styles.\n\nWith these revisions, the paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of reinforcement learning."

The paper addresses a relevant and challenging problem in machine learning, namely online adaptation to label-shift in the presence of conditional-shift.\n2. The authors propose several heuristics to improve the performance of online adaptation methods in such scenarios.\n3. The paper provides empirical evidence to support the effectiveness of the proposed heuristics on various datasets.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n1.

The paper proposes an interesting idea of using binary labels as an auxiliary task to improve image classification performance.\n2. The results show small improvements over baseline methods using standard one-hot encoding, especially for classification in special domains.\n3. The approach is simple and effective, and the use of random binary partitions can create useful related tasks for the neural network to train on.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n1. The technical contribution of the paper seems limited, and the main idea is to use binary labels as an auxiliary task during training.\n2. The multi-task learning architecture is basic, with one independent branch for each task.\n3. The paper lacks clear explanations of how binary labels improve performance and what problem they solve.\n4. The experimental results are insufficient to show the effectiveness of the algorithm, and the baseline algorithm was set to those with too low performance.\n5. The paper does not clearly explain how binary labels are generated in the experiment section.\n6. The paper lacks analysis of the weighting between the two tasks and its robustness.\n7. The proposed approach seems to be limited to multiclass image classification and does not generalize to multilabel image classification.\n8. The paper does not evaluate on large benchmarks like ImageNet.\n\n**Reviewer Comments:**\n\n1. Reviewer 1 highlights the clarity issues, experimental weaknesses, and lack of intuition or analysis to shed light on when the proposed approach helps.\n2. Reviewer 2 criticizes the paper's notations, calculation errors, and lack of insight or analysis in the proposed algorithm.\n3. Reviewer 3 praises the simplicity and effectiveness of the approach but notes that the contribution might not be significant enough due to small empirical improvements.\n4.

The paper presents a novel contribution to the field of permuted linear regression, specifically in identifying the phase transition thresholds via message passing.\n2. However, the paper has several issues with clarity, quality, and reproducibility. The writing is often dense and difficult to follow, with many typos and grammatical errors. The notation and definitions are not always clear, and the authors often refer to external sources without providing sufficient context.\n3. The paper relies heavily on prior work, and some of the results seem to be corollaries of established theorems. The authors' claims about the novelty and significance of their contributions are not entirely supported by the evidence.\n4. The numerical experiments and results are not well-presented, and the authors' claims about the alignment of empirical and theoretical results are not convincing.\n5. The paper has several minor issues, such as the use of vague terminology, unclear notation, and incomplete explanations.\n\nConsidering these observations, I believe that the paper requires significant revisions to address the issues mentioned above. The authors need to improve the clarity and quality of the writing, provide more context and explanations for the notation and definitions, and ensure that the claims about novelty and significance are supported by the evidence.\n\nBased on the reviewer comments and my analysis, I conclude that the paper is not yet ready for publication in its current form.

The paper addresses an important problem in the field of machine learning, specifically privacy-preserving representation learning in the context of Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS).\n2. The authors propose a novel approach called \"Scrunch\" that splits a neural network into two parts, with the client applying raw data through the first part and sending the encoded data to the server for final inference.\n3. The paper presents results on two models (LeNet-5 and VGG-16) and two datasets (MNIST and CelebA), which demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed approach.\n\n**Weaknesses of the paper:**\n\n1. The reviewer comments highlight several technical flaws and concerns with the paper, including:\n\t* The proposed approach is flawed due to the server's ability to recreate a \"surrogate\" encoder, which compromises the privacy of the client's data.\n\t* The threat model is incomplete, and the server can easily turn off the center loss to zero and back propagate only the cross-entropy loss.\n\t* The experimental evaluation is simplistic, and the results are unconvincing.\n\t* The paper lacks a clear security model, and the use of middle features of the neural network is still risky for information leakage.\n2. The paper has several grammatical errors and ambiguous statements, which affect the clarity and quality of the paper.\n3. The novelty of the work is somewhat limited, and the core idea is similar to split learning, which has not been mentioned in the paper.\n\n**Author Response:**\n\nUnfortunately, there is no author response provided, which makes it difficult to address the reviewer comments and concerns.\n\n**Final Decision:**\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, I conclude that this paper should be **Rejected** for publication at a top-tier conference like ICLR. The paper has several technical flaws, concerns, and limitations that need to be addressed before it can be considered for publication. The reviewer comments highlight several issues with the paper, including the flawed approach, incomplete threat model, simplistic experimental evaluation, and lack of clear security model.
