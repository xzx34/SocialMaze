This statement could be true or false since Player 2 is the Criminal and can lie.\n3. **Player 3**: Claims Player 6 is not the criminal. This could be true or false; Player 3 could be a Rumormonger or a Lunatic.\n4. **Player 4**: Claims Player 2 is the criminal. This statement is true since Player 2 is indeed the Criminal.\n5. **Player 5**: Claims Player 6 is not the criminal. This could be true or false; Player 5 could be a Rumormonger or a Lunatic.\n6. **Player 6**: Claims Player 5 is not the criminal. This could be true or false; Player 6 could be an Investigator or a Rumormonger.\n\nFrom the statements, we can draw the following conclusions:\n\n- Player 1's statement about Player 5 not being the criminal is truthful.\n- Player 2's statement about Player 6 not being the criminal is suspect since Player 2 is the Criminal and can lie.\n- Player 3's statement about Player 6 not being the criminal is uncertain; if Player 3 is a Rumormonger or Lunatic, this could be misleading.\n- Player 4's statement about Player 2 being the criminal is true, confirming Player 4's role as either an Investigator or a Rumormonger.\n- Player 5's statement about Player 6 not being the criminal is uncertain; if Player 5 is a Rumormonger or Lunatic, this could be misleading.\n- Player 6's statement about Player 5 not being the criminal is uncertain; if Player 6 is an Investigator or a Rumormonger, this could be misleading.\n\nGiven that Player 1 is confirmed as an Investigator and Player 4 has correctly identified Player 2 as the Criminal, we can conclude that Player 2 is indeed the Criminal.\n\nNow, let's summarize the roles based on the statements:\n\n- Player 1: Investigator (truthful)\n- Player 2: Criminal (based on Player 1's truthful statement)\n- Player 3: Rumormonger or Lunatic (since they make an uncertain statement about Player 6)\n- Player 4: Investigator (truthfully identifies Player 2 as the Criminal)\n- Player 5: Rumormonger or Lunatic (makes an uncertain statement about Player 6)\n- Player 6: Investigator or Rumormonger (makes an uncertain statement about Player 5)\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 2.\nThe roles of players 1-6 are:\nFinal Player 1: Investigator\nFinal Player 2: Criminal\nFinal Player 3: Rumormonger or Lunatic\nFinal Player 4: Investigator\nFinal Player 5: Rumormonger or Lunatic\nFinal Player 6: Investigator or Rumormonger\n\nThis concludes the analysis of the game based on the statements provided in all three rounds."
