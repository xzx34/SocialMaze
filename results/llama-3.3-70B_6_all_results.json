This indicates Player 4 could be the Criminal, Rumormonger, or Lunatic, as they provided misleading information.\n- Player 6's statement that Player 4 is the criminal could be true or false. If I am correct that Player 6 is the criminal, then Player 6's statement about Player 4 is likely an attempt to mislead.\n- Players 2 and 3 both stated that Player 5 is not the criminal, which could be true. If so, it suggests that Player 5 might not be the criminal, but without more information, it's hard to determine their role or the criminal's identity with absolute certainty.\n\nGiven this analysis, my previous speculation about Player 6 being the criminal gains more support, especially considering my own statement as an Investigator. However, the roles of other players are still somewhat unclear.\n\nFinal Judgment after Round 2:\nFinal Criminal Is Player: 6\nThe roles of players 1-6 are:\nFinal Player 1: Investigator\nFinal Player 2: Investigator (speculative, seems plausible given the supportive statement)\nFinal Player 3: Investigator (speculative, aligns with Player 2, could be another truthful role)\nFinal Player 4: Unknown (provided false information, could be Criminal, Rumormonger, or Lunatic)\nFinal Player 5: Unknown (statements from others suggest not the criminal, but role unclear)\nFinal Player 6: Criminal (based on my Investigator statement and the analysis of Round 2 statements)\n\nThis judgment is more informed than after Round 1 but still subject to change based on Round 3's statements."

This statement, combined with **Player 6**'s previous false accusation, suggests that **Player 6** is indeed a deceitful role, likely the Criminal or the Lunatic. However, the fact that **Player 6** accused me falsely in Round 2 and now accuses **Player 5** introduces a complexity. If **Player 6** is the Criminal, the accusation against **Player 5** could be a lie. If **Player 6** is the Lunatic, believing themselves to be the Criminal, they might accuse someone they believe is not the \"real\" Criminal (in their misguided belief).\n\nConsidering all rounds:\n\n- **Player 2** is consistently defended by truthful statements (including my own), suggesting **Player 2** is indeed an Investigator.\n- **Player 6**'s behavior (false accusations) strongly suggests a deceitful role, likely the Criminal or the Lunatic.\n- **Player 3**'s accusation against **Player 2** in Round 3, contradicting previous truthful statements, suggests **Player 3** might be providing false information, potentially as the Lunatic or the Criminal.\n- **Player 5**'s statement about **Player 6** not being the Criminal could be an attempt to mislead or a genuine mistake, given the complexity of **Player 6**'s behavior.\n\nGiven the analysis:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 6.\nThe roles of players 1-6 are:\nFinal Player 1: Investigator\nFinal Player 2: Investigator\nFinal Player 3: Lunatic (Given the false accusation against **Player 2** and the overall behavior)\nFinal Player 4: Investigator (Based on the consistent defense of **Player 2** and the lack of contradictory evidence)\nFinal Player 5: Rumormonger (Given the potential for mistaken or misleading statements, and the defense of **Player 6** which could be a genuine mistake)\nFinal Player 6: Criminal (Given the consistent pattern of deceitful behavior and false accusations)\n\nThis final judgment takes into account all statements from the three rounds and aims to provide a coherent explanation of the roles based on the information provided."

As the Criminal, my statement is intended to mislead.\n- **Player 2** says Player 3 is the Criminal.\n- **Player 3** says Player 2 is not the Criminal.\n- **Player 4** says Player 2 is not the Criminal.\n- **Player 5** says Player 3 is not the Criminal.\n- **Player 6** says Player 2 is the Criminal.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- If Player 2 were indeed the Criminal, then Player 3 and Player 4's statements would be truthful, suggesting they could be Investigators. However, this doesn't immediately clarify their roles without considering the statements of all players.\n- Player 1's statement (myself) is likely a deception, given my role as the Criminal.\n- The statements about Player 2 being the Criminal (by Player 2 themselves, if they were an Investigator, would not accuse themselves, but here it's Player 6 accusing them) and not being the Criminal (by Players 3 and 4) create a conflict. If Player 2 were indeed the Criminal, then Players 3 and 4 would be telling the truth, potentially marking them as Investigators.\n- Player 5's statement supports Player 3 not being the Criminal, which could align with Player 5 being an Investigator if Player 3 is indeed not the Criminal.\n\n**Initial Deductions**:\n- Given my role as the Criminal and my statement accusing Player 4, I am attempting to deflect. Thus, my statement about Player 4 is likely false.\n- Players 3 and 4 both defend Player 2, suggesting they might be truthful, potentially marking them as Investigators or at least not the Criminal.\n- Player 6 accuses Player 2, which could be a truthful statement if Player 6 is an Investigator, or a misleading one if they are not.\n\n**Judgment After Round 1**:\nGiven the information and attempting to deduce roles based on the statements, it's challenging to pinpoint the Criminal and roles with certainty after just one round. However, considering the dynamics:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1. (Given I know my role, but let's analyze as if deducing)\nThe roles of players 1-6 are:\nFinal Player 1: Criminal\nFinal Player 2: Unknown (Potential Investigator or target of accusations)\nFinal Player 3: Potential Investigator\nFinal Player 4: Potential Investigator\nFinal Player 5: Potential Investigator\nFinal Player 6: Potential Investigator or Misleading Role\n\nThis judgment is highly speculative after Round 1, and roles will become clearer as more information is gathered in subsequent rounds."

However, it's also possible that Player 4 is just coincidentally telling the truth or is trying to protect Player 3 for other reasons.\n\n5. **Player 5 says Player 4 is not the criminal.** Similar to the previous statement, this could indicate that Player 5 is an Investigator, but given the pattern of statements, it's also possible that Player 5 is the Rumormonger, providing statements that might not always align with the truth.\n\n6. **Player 6 says Player 5 is the criminal.** This statement is false since I know I am the criminal. Given that Player 6 made a statement in Round 1 that seemed protective and truthful, this change in behavior could suggest that Player 6 is the Lunatic, believing themselves to be the criminal and making statements based on that belief.\n\nConsidering these statements and the roles' behaviors:\n\n- **Player 2** is likely an **Investigator** because they correctly identified me as the criminal.\n- **Player 3** and **Player 6** could be either the **Rumormonger** or the **Lunatic**, given their false accusations. However, **Player 6**'s change in behavior from Round 1 to Round 2 might lean more towards being the **Lunatic**.\n- **Player 4** and **Player 5** could be **Investigators** or the **Rumormonger**, but their consistent protective statements might suggest they are **Investigators**.\n\n**Final Judgment after Round 2:**\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nThe roles of players 1-6 are:\nFinal Player 1: Criminal\nFinal Player 2: Investigator\nFinal Player 3: Rumormonger\nFinal Player 4: Investigator\nFinal Player 5: Investigator\nFinal Player 6: Lunatic\n\nThis judgment is refined based on the direct accusation by Player 2, the change in behavior by Player 6, and the patterns of statements that seem to either truthfully protect or falsely accuse, aligning with the roles' expected behaviors."

It suggests that Player 2 might not be an Investigator as previously thought, or there's an unexpected dynamic at play. However, considering the game mechanics, it's more likely that Player 2's previous statement was a coincidence or part of a larger strategy, and this statement could be a mistake or an attempt to mislead, which doesn't fit the Investigator role perfectly.\n\n3. **Player 3 says Player 4 is not the criminal.** This statement could be true or false. If Player 3 is the Rumormonger, as previously suspected, this statement might not be reliable.\n\n4. **Player 4 says Player 5 is not the criminal.** This statement aligns with the truth, as I know I am the Criminal, and Player 5 is not. Given the consistency of Player 4's statements across rounds, it's plausible that Player 4 is an Investigator.\n\n5. **Player 5 says Player 3 is not the criminal.** This statement is true, as I am the Criminal, and Player 3 is not. However, given the previous suspicions about Player 5's role, this could also be a coincidence or part of a strategy.\n\n6. **Player 6 says Player 4 is not the criminal.** This statement is true and aligns with the previous assessment that Player 6 might be the Lunatic, as they are making a statement that happens to be true but could be based on their misguided belief about their own role.\n\nConsidering these statements and the overall pattern:\n\n- **Player 2**'s false accusation of Player 5 as the criminal in Round 3, after correctly identifying me in Round 2, introduces a complexity. It's possible that Player 2 is not an Investigator but rather another role that occasionally provides truthful information.\n- **Player 4**'s consistent statements across rounds suggesting they are not the criminal and their protective statements towards others could indicate they are an **Investigator**.\n- **Player 6**'s statement, while true, and their behavior across rounds might still suggest they are the **Lunatic**.\n\nGiven the information and the need to make a final judgment:\n\n**Final Judgment after Round 3:**\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nThe roles of players 1-6 are:\nFinal Player 1: Criminal\nFinal Player 2: Rumormonger\nFinal Player 3: Lunatic\nFinal Player 4: Investigator\nFinal Player 5: Investigator\nFinal Player 6: Lunatic\n\nThis final judgment takes into account the complexities and inconsistencies across the rounds, attempting to align the statements with the roles' expected behaviors. Player 2's unexpected false accusation leads to reevaluating their role as possibly the Rumormonger, given the initial correct identification could have been a coincidence or strategic move. Player 3 and Player 6's behaviors are reassessed based on their statements and the overall dynamics, suggesting they could both fit the Lunatic role due to their unpredictable statements, but given the game's constraints, one must be the Lunatic, and the other could fit another role. However, the provided judgment aims to offer a coherent conclusion based on the information given."

However, it's possible that Player 5 is an Investigator providing truthful information, or they could be another role.\n6. **Player 6 says Player 1 is not the criminal.** Since I am indeed an Investigator and not the Criminal, this statement is true. Given that Player 6 has provided information that supports the truth (in this case, about me), it suggests that Player 6 could be an Investigator or at least a non-Criminal role.\n\n**Deductions After Round 3:**\n\n- **Player 3**'s accusation against Player 5, given their previous behavior, is likely false, reinforcing the notion that **Player 3 is the Lunatic**.\n- **Player 2**'s new accusation against Player 6, after previously accusing Player 3, suggests that **Player 2 might be the Criminal**. Criminals can provide false or misleading information to confuse others.\n- **Player 5**'s statement that Player 3 is the criminal (though we believe Player 3 is the Lunatic) could indicate that **Player 5 is an Investigator** trying to provide truthful information based on their understanding.\n- **Player 6**'s truthful statement about me (Player 1) not being the criminal suggests that **Player 6 could also be an Investigator**.\n\n**Final Judgment After Round 3:**\n\nGiven the analysis and the accumulation of information:\n\nFinal Criminal Is Player 2.\nThe roles of players 1-6 are:\nFinal Player 1: Investigator\nFinal Player 2: Criminal\nFinal Player 3: Lunatic\nFinal Player 4: Rumormonger\nFinal Player 5: Investigator\nFinal Player 6: Investigator\n\nThis final judgment takes into account the consistent accusations, the behaviors of the players, and the logical deductions based on the roles and their expected behaviors in the game. Player 2's change in accusation and the overall pattern of statements lead to the conclusion that Player 2 is likely the Criminal. The roles of the other players are deduced based on their statements' consistency, truthfulness, and alignment with the expected behaviors of their roles."

However, it's crucial to remember that only Investigators provide consistently truthful information.\n\n**Deductions**:\n- Since I know I'm an Investigator and my statement about Player 4 is based on the information I have, I will initially stick with my assessment unless proven otherwise.\n- Player 4's statement about me not being the criminal is correct, which might suggest they are also an Investigator, but it's too early to confirm.\n- The accusations and denials from other players are mixed and don't provide clear evidence yet.\n\n**Final Judgment After Round 1**:\nGiven the limited information and the need to make an educated guess, I will proceed with caution.\n\nFinal Criminal Is Player 4.\nThe roles of players 1-6 are:\nFinal Player 1: Investigator\nFinal Player 2: Unknown\nFinal Player 3: Unknown\nFinal Player 4: Criminal\nFinal Player 5: Unknown\nFinal Player 6: Unknown\n\nThis judgment is highly speculative at this stage, and further rounds will be crucial in clarifying the roles and identifying the criminal accurately."

Player 6, having made statements that are true but could be seen as attempts to deflect or mislead, is considered the Lunatic. Players 2 and 3, having made statements that align with the truth and having been less accused, are also considered Investigators."

However, it doesn't reveal much about Player 5's role.\n6. **Player 6 says Player 2 is not the criminal.** This statement supports the previous impressions that Player 2 might be telling the truth, potentially being an Investigator.\n\n**Deductions:**\n\n- **Player 3** seems less likely to be the Criminal given my statement in Round 2, but their role as Rumormonger or Lunatic is still plausible due to their initial false accusation.\n- **Player 2** consistently states that I am not the criminal, which aligns with the truth and suggests they could be an Investigator.\n- **Players 4 and 5** seem to be providing truthful information in Round 2, but without more context, it's hard to determine their roles.\n- **Player 6** also seems to provide truthful information, but like Players 4 and 5, their role remains unclear.\n\n**Updated Judgment:**\n\nGiven the new information, the picture is still not entirely clear, but some roles and the criminal's identity can be speculated upon with more confidence.\n\n**Final Judgment After Round 2:**\nFinal Criminal Is Player 5.\nThe roles of players 1-6 are:\nFinal Player 1: Investigator\nFinal Player 2: Investigator\nFinal Player 3: Rumormonger/Lunatic\nFinal Player 4: Unknown\nFinal Player 5: Potential Criminal\nFinal Player 6: Unknown\n\nThis judgment is speculative, especially regarding Player 5's role as the potential criminal, which is based on the process of elimination and the fact that less information has been directly contradicting or supporting their potential role as the criminal compared to others. Further analysis after Round 3 will be crucial for a more accurate determination."

However, since Player 3's reliability is questionable (potential Rumormonger or Lunatic), this statement's truthfulness is not definitive.\n4. **Player 4 says Player 1 is the criminal.** This is a false statement since I am an Investigator and not the criminal. This strongly suggests that Player 4 is either the Criminal or the Lunatic, as they would knowingly make false accusations.\n5. **Player 5 says Player 4 is the criminal.** This statement aligns with my own conclusion in Round 3. If Player 5 is an Investigator, this would confirm Player 4 as the criminal.\n6. **Player 6 says Player 2 is not the criminal.** This statement is consistent with previous statements and reinforces the idea that Player 2 is likely not the criminal.\n\n**Final Deductions:**\n\n- **Player 4's** statement that I am the criminal is a clear lie, which, combined with my own analysis and statement, strongly suggests that **Player 4 is the Criminal**. This is because only the Criminal would knowingly accuse an Investigator of being the criminal.\n- **Player 2's** consistent defense of my innocence and their statement that Player 4 is not the criminal, despite my accusation, suggests that **Player 2 is indeed an Investigator**, as they have provided truthful information throughout the game, even if it contradicts my final conclusion about Player 4.\n- **Player 3** remains questionable but is likely the Rumormonger or Lunatic due to their initial false accusation against me.\n- **Player 5** aligning with my conclusion about Player 4 could suggest they are also an Investigator, but without more direct evidence, this remains speculative.\n- **Player 6** has provided consistent truthful information, suggesting they could also be an Investigator.\n\n**Final Judgment:**\nFinal Criminal Is Player 4.\nThe roles of players 1-6 are:\nFinal Player 1: Investigator\nFinal Player 2: Investigator\nFinal Player 3: Rumormonger/Lunatic\nFinal Player 4: Criminal\nFinal Player 5: Investigator\nFinal Player 6: Investigator\n\nThis final judgment is based on the analysis of all statements across the three rounds, focusing on the consistency of truthfulness and the logical deductions from the statements provided by each player."

If Player 4 is an Investigator, then Player 2 is not the criminal.\n\n5. **Player 5 says Player 2 is the criminal.** This statement is false because I know I am the criminal. If Player 5 were an Investigator, they would not make false accusations. This suggests Player 5 might be either the Rumormonger or the Lunatic, but since they are accusing someone else of being the criminal, it's less likely they believe they are the criminal (Lunatic's trait), making Rumormonger a possible role.\n\n6. **Player 6 says Player 1 is the criminal.** Like Player 3, this statement is true. Given that only Investigators provide truthful information consistently, Player 6 could also be an Investigator.\n\nGiven these observations:\n- Players 3 and 6 are likely Investigators because they correctly identified me as the criminal.\n- Player 5's false accusation against Player 2, combined with my statement against Player 5, suggests Player 5 could be the Rumormonger, as they might believe they are an Investigator but provide incorrect information.\n- Player 2 and Player 4's statements need further analysis, but since they did not accuse me, and considering the roles of Players 3 and 6, they could potentially be the remaining Investigator and the Lunatic, or one of them could be the Rumormonger if Player 5 is actually the Lunatic. However, given the information, it seems more likely that one of them could be the Lunatic, believing they are the criminal but not consistently providing false information about others being the criminal.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nThe roles of players 1-6 are:\nFinal Player 1: Criminal\nFinal Player 2: Lunatic\nFinal Player 3: Investigator\nFinal Player 4: Investigator\nFinal Player 5: Rumormonger\nFinal Player 6: Investigator\n\nThis judgment is based on the analysis of Round 1 statements and may change as more information becomes available in subsequent rounds."
