If Player 2 were an Investigator, this would mean Player 6 is indeed the criminal, but since I know my statement is true, Player 2 must be either the Criminal or the Rumormonger.\n\n3. **Player 3**: Says Player 2 is not the criminal. This aligns with my previous statement that Player 2 is not the criminal. If Player 3 is truthful, they could be an Investigator.\n\n4. **Player 4**: Also says Player 2 is not the criminal. This is consistent with my own knowledge and Player 3\u2019s statement.\n\n5. **Player 5**: Also says Player 2 is not the criminal. This consistency suggests Players 3, 4, and 5 may all be Investigators or they could be following a misleading consensus.\n\n6. **Player 6**: Says Player 1 is the criminal. Since I know I am not the criminal, Player 6\u2019s statement is false. This suggests Player 6 could be the Criminal or the Rumormonger.\n\nAnalysis:\n\n- My statement that Player 6 is not the criminal must be true.\n- Player 2\u2019s accusation of Player 6 contradicts my statement, which means Player 2 is likely the Rumormonger or the Criminal.\n- The consistent defense of Player 2 by Players 3, 4, and 5 suggests they might be truthful Investigators or deceived by Player 2, assuming Player 2 is not the criminal.\n- Player 6 accusing me falsely is suspicious, typically behavior of a Rumormonger or the actual Criminal.\n\nConsidering this, Player 2\u2019s contradiction of my statement makes them highly suspicious. However, Player 6\u2019s false accusation against me needs to be considered.\n\n**Final Judgment after Round 2:**\nFinal Criminal Is Player 2.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

Player 6's defense of me further supports that they might not be the criminal, and Player 2 and 4's defense of Player 6 raises the possibility of complicity.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 4.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

Player 6 was previously suspected, and with Player 4 also making contradictory statements, one of them is likely the Criminal. However, Player 6 has shown a pattern of contradictory statements over two rounds.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 6.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

Knowing I am the Criminal, this statement is aimed at misleading others.\n\n2. **Player 2:** Claims Player 3 is the criminal. If Player 2 is an Investigator, this would be true, but it contradicts Players 3 and 4's consistent claims against me from both rounds. This suggests Player 2 might be the Rumormonger or the Criminal attempting misdirection.\n\n3. **Player 3:** Again states that Player 1 is the criminal. This consistency with their first-round statement strengthens the possibility that Player 3 is an Investigator.\n\n4. **Player 4:** Also repeats that Player 1 is the criminal, aligning with Player 3. This consistency suggests Player 4 is likely another Investigator.\n\n5. **Player 5:** Now claims Player 1 is the criminal, joining Players 3 and 4 in their accusation, which suggests Player 5 could be an Investigator or being truthful as a Rumormonger.\n\n6. **Player 6:** Says Player 4 is not the criminal. If Player 6 is an Investigator, this is a truthful statement. If Player 6 is the Rumormonger, this could be incorrect, but it aligns with the idea that Player 4 is not the Criminal, given Players 3 and 4's consistent statements against me.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- Players 3, 4, and 5 consistently accuse me (Player 1) of being the criminal, which aligns with what I know to be true.\n- Player 6's statement supports Player 4 not being the Criminal, which aligns with Players 3 and 4's accusations against me.\n- Player 2's accusation against Player 3 seems unfounded given Player 3's consistent behavior.\n\nBased on Round 2 statements:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

If Player 3 is an Investigator, this is a truthful statement, which doesn't contradict any previous rounds since Player 5 hasn't been accused by others significantly.\n\n4. **Player 4:** Continues to say Player 1 is the criminal, consistent across all rounds.

In Round 1, Player 3 claimed I was the criminal, which was false. This pattern suggests Player 3 is either the Criminal or a misled Rumormonger.\n\n4. **Player 4**: Also claims Player 5 is the criminal. In Round 1, Player 4 said Player 3 was not the criminal. Since Player 3 falsely accused me, Player 4 seems to be consistently aligning with Player 3, which is suspicious.\n\n5. **Player 5**: Says Player 4 is not the criminal. In Round 1, Player 5 accused Player 2, which is contradictory to Round 2's statement. This inconsistency could indicate Player 5 is the Rumormonger.\n\n6. **Player 6**: Says Player 4 is not the criminal, aligning with Player 5. In Round 1, Player 6 said Player 3 was not the criminal, which was false. Player 6\u2019s statements seem to be consistently misleading or aligning suspiciously with others.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- **Player 3** continues to stand out as suspicious due to the false accusation against me in Round 1.\n- **Players 4 and 6** are consistently supporting each other and Player 3, indicating possible collusion or shared misinformation.\n- **Player 5** has inconsistencies between rounds, but less so than the pattern seen with Players 3, 4, and 6.\n\nGiven the information from both rounds, the most consistent pattern of deception and false accusations suggests that Player 3 is the Criminal, with collusion from Players 4 and 6 likely due to misinformation or their roles as Rumormonger.\n\n### Final Judgment After Round 2:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 3.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

Player 5 is likely another Investigator or someone telling the truth for this round.\n\n6. **Player 6**: Says Player 2 is the criminal. Another contradictory statement to mine. Player 6 could be the Criminal, the Rumormonger, or making a false statement.\n\nBased on these statements:\n- **Player 2** is not the criminal (confirmed by me, the Investigator).\n- **Contradictory statements** about Player 2 being the criminal from Players 4 and 6 suggest one of them could be the Criminal.\n\nGiven this analysis, it is reasonable to suspect either Player 4 or Player 6 as the Criminal. With limited information, it is difficult to distinguish between the two at this point, but we have more reason to suspect them than others.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 4 or Player 6 (uncertain between the two).\nMy Role Is Investigator."

However, given the game rules, my belief could be incorrect, especially because of the presence of the Rumormonger, who believes they are an Investigator and provides potentially incorrect information. Therefore, let's analyze the statements to see if there's any contradiction or pattern that helps identify roles.\n\nRound 1 Analysis:\n- Player 1 (me) says Player 3 is not the criminal. If I am indeed the Criminal, then my statement may be true or false. \n- Player 2 says Player 4 is not the criminal. If Player 2 is an Investigator, this is true. If Player 2 is the Rumormonger or the Criminal, it could be true or false.\n- Player 3 says Player 5 is not the criminal. If Player 3 is an Investigator, this is true. If Player 3 is the Rumormonger or the Criminal, it could be true or false.\n- Player 4 says Player 1 (me) is the criminal. If Player 4 is an Investigator, this is true.

If Player 6 is the Rumormonger or the Criminal, it could be true or false.\n\nKey Observations:\n- Player 4 accuses me (Player 1) of being the criminal. If Player 4 is an Investigator, then my initial belief of being the Criminal is correct.\n- Player 6 accuses Player 4 of being the criminal. If Player 6 is an Investigator, this directly contradicts Player 4's statement, suggesting Player 4 is not truthful.\n\nGiven these observations, the conflicting statements between Player 4 and Player 6 suggest that one of them is not truthful.

However, since Player 3 could be a Rumormonger or Criminal, this statement requires further cross-reference with other statements.\n\n4. **Player 4**: Says Player 1 is not the criminal. This aligns with my knowledge as I am not the criminal, suggesting Player 4 could be an Investigator.\n\n5. **Player 5**: Says Player 6 is not the criminal. If truthful, this would mean Player 6 is not the criminal. Again, we need to consider if Player 5 is a Rumormonger or Criminal.\n\n6. **Player 6**: Says Player 1 is not the criminal. This supports my role as an Investigator, but Player 6's role remains uncertain.\n\nGiven that Player 4 is not the criminal, the statement from Player 2 is false, which makes Player 2 a likely candidate for the Criminal or Rumormonger. The truthfulness of Player 3's and Player 5's statements cannot be confirmed without more information. Player 6's statement supports my role, but their intention remains unclear.\n\n**Final Judgment after Round 1:**\nFinal Criminal Is Player 2.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

This discrepancy makes Player 6's statement stand out. However, given that Player 6's statement is in the minority and conflicts with multiple others, it is more likely that Player 6 is either the Rumormonger or trying to mislead as the Criminal.\n\nFinal Judgment after Round 1:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 6.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

          "response": "Based on the statements from Round 1, let's analyze the information:\n\n1. **Player 1 (me)**: I am told I am the Criminal, so I intentionally accuse Player 3, but this could be a false or deceptive claim.\n\n2. **Player 2**: Claims Player 6 is not the criminal. If Player 2 is an Investigator, this statement is true. If Player 2 is the Rumormonger, this statement could be false.\n\n3. **Player 3**: Also claims Player 6 is not the criminal. Similar reasoning as Player 2 applies here. If Player 3 is an Investigator, the statement is true; if the Rumormonger, it may be false.\n\n4. **Player 4**: Claims Player 2 is not the criminal. Again, could indicate Player 4 is an Investigator or the Rumormonger.\n\n5. **Player 5**: Claims Player 4 is not the criminal. If true, Player 5 might be an Investigator; otherwise, if Player 5 is the Rumormonger, it could be incorrect.\n\n6. **Player 6**: Claims Player 3 is not the criminal. If true, Player 6 might be an Investigator; otherwise, if Player 6 is the Rumormonger, it could be incorrect.\n\nFrom the statements:\n\n- Players 2, 3, and 4 have been vouched for by others. \n- Player 6 is vouched for by both Players 2 and 3, which adds some credibility to their status.\n- Player 5's statement about Player 4 not being the criminal may be a truthful statement if Player 5 is an Investigator.\n\nGiven that I am told I am the Criminal, it is possible I am actually not the Criminal due to the game mechanics allowing for misinformation (if I were the Lunatic, for example). However, without additional contradictory evidence, it remains my working assumption that I am indeed the Criminal.\n\nThus, given the information:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

          "response": "Let's analyze the Round 2 statements along with the previous ones:\n\n1. **Player 1 (me)**: I accused Player 2 this round, continuing with potentially false or misleading statements as I am told I am the Criminal.\n\n2. **Player 2**: Claims Player 3 is not the criminal. Player 2 continues to clear other players, which could indicate an Investigator, but there's still the possibility of being a Rumormonger.\n\n3. **Player 3**: Claims Player 1 (me) is the criminal. If Player 3 is an Investigator, this is a truthful statement, implicating me directly. If Player 3 is a Rumormonger, this could still be a deceptive claim.\n\n4. **Player 4**: Claims Player 5 is not the criminal, continuing the pattern from the previous round of clearing others.\n\n5. **Player 5**: Claims Player 6 is not the criminal. Player 5 continues to clear Player 6, which could be consistent if they are an Investigator or a Rumormonger.\n\n6. **Player 6**: Claims Player 5 is not the criminal. This mutual clearing between Player 5 and Player 6 could indicate both are Investigators or one is misleading (i.e., the Rumormonger).\n\nReviewing both rounds, here are some key observations:\n\n- Player 3 directly accuses me (Player 1) of being the criminal, which aligns with me being told I am the Criminal.\n- Players 5 and 6 are mutually clearing each other, which is consistent for two Investigators or one being a Rumormonger.\n- Player 2 continues to clear others, which could suggest an Investigator or Rumormonger role.\n\nGiven the consistent accusation from Player 3 and the possibility that I am indeed the Criminal (as I was informed), Player 3's statement aligns with my initial understanding of my role.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

This is consistent with my role as the Criminal, attempting to mislead.\n\n2. **Player 2**: Claims Player 5 is not the criminal. If Player 2 is an Investigator, this statement is true. If Player 2 is the Rumormonger, it might be false.\n\n3. **Player 3**: Consistently accuses Player 1 (me) of being the criminal across rounds. If Player 3 is an Investigator, this statement is true, reinforcing the idea that I am the Criminal.\n\n4. **Player 4**: Claims Player 6 is the criminal. This is the first direct accusation against Player 6, which could suggest Player 4 as a Rumormonger or a misled Investigator.\n\n5. **Player 5**: Says Player 4 is not the criminal, continuing to clear others. This could indicate an Investigator role or a Rumormonger role.\n\n6. **Player 6**: Says Player 2 is not the criminal, maintaining a pattern of clearing others.\n\n**Analysis Across Rounds:**\n\n- Player 3 has consistently accused me (Player 1) as the criminal, which aligns with the information I was given.\n- Players 2 and 6 have been consistent in not accusing directly and mainly clearing others, suggesting they could be Investigators.\n- Player 4's accusation of Player 6 as the criminal is interesting because it's a deviation from the pattern seen previously.\n- Players 5 and 6's mutual clearance looks like a strong indication of Investigator roles, barring any misdirection by a Rumormonger.\n\nBased on the consistent accusation from Player 3 and the consistent pattern of clearing or accusing others from the rest, it aligns with the possibility that I am indeed the Criminal. Given the game mechanics and my understanding of roles, Player 3 appears to be an Investigator whose accusations align with my role.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

As an Investigator, my statement is truthful.\n\n2. **Player 2**: Claims Player 4 is the criminal. If Player 2 is the Criminal, this statement is likely false, which aligns with my claim that Player 2 is the criminal. Alternatively, if Player 2 is Rumormonger, they might genuinely believe they are an Investigator but provide incorrect information.\n\n3. **Player 3**: Also claims Player 2 is the criminal. If Player 3 is an Investigator, this corroborates my statement. If Player 3 is the Rumormonger, they could still provide incorrect information by chance.\n\n4. **Player 4**: States Player 3 is not the criminal. If true, it suggests Player 3 is likely an Investigator or Rumormonger.\n\n5. **Player 5**: States I am not the criminal. This aligns with my role as an Investigator.\n\n6. **Player 6**: States Player 3 is not the criminal. This supports Player 4\u2019s claim that Player 3 is not the criminal.\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Player 2** is the only one accused by two players (Player 1 and Player 3) of being the criminal.\n- **Player 3**, **Player 4**, and **Player 6**'s statements do not contradict each other regarding Player 3's innocence.\n- **Player 5** confirms my innocence, which aligns with me being an Investigator.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the consistency in statements regarding Player 2's potential guilt and the corroboration of my innocence, it is reasonable to suspect Player 2 as the criminal.
