This seems like a coordinated effort to protect Player 6.\n\n**Final Deductions:**\n\n* Player 6:  The overwhelming support for Player 6's innocence makes them highly suspicious. This level of collective defense is unusual unless they are trying to hide something.\n\n* Player 4:  While they accused me directly in Round 2, their statement in Round 3 defending Player 6 throws doubt on their Investigator status.\n\n**Final Judgment:**\n\nFinal Criminal Is Player [6].\nMy Role Is Criminal.\n\n## Conclusion:\n\nI believe Player 6 is the most likely criminal. The coordinated defense they receive is too strong to ignore. While I may be wrong, I've done my best to sow confusion and point the finger elsewhere. Now the other players must decide who to trust."
