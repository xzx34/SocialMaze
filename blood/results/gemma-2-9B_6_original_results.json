Player 5 and 6 are in agreement, stating Player 6 is not the criminal. My statement accusing Player 5 is intended to throw off suspicion.\n\nConsidering the pattern:\n\n*   Player 3 consistently accused me in Round 1 and 2, then switched to defending Player 4. This is *highly* suspicious. If Player 3 is an Investigator, they've made a significant error. If they're a Lunatic, they're being incredibly consistent in their confusing behavior.\n*   Player 4 consistently defended Player 3, making them look like a good candidate for an Investigator.\n*   Player 2 has now directly accused me. This could be a genuine Investigator finally pinpointing me, or a desperate attempt to deflect.\n\nGiven the consistent accusations from Player 2 and the shifting, confusing statements from Player 3, I'm going to trust Player 2's final accusation. I will assume Player 3 is a Lunatic attempting to confuse everyone.\n\n**Final Judgment:**\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role "

This is incredibly strong evidence.\n\nLet's revisit my previous deductions:\n\n*   **Player 6:** Almost certainly an Investigator (correctly identified me in Round 2).\n*   **Player 2 & Player 3:** Contradictory statements in Round 2.

It's more probable that they are genuinely aligned on this point.\n\nGiven that Player 6 is almost certainly an Investigator, and all players (including Player 6) agree Player 4 is not the criminal, it's highly likely Player 4 is *not* the criminal.

If they are a Rumormonger or Lunatic, they are incorrect.\n*   **Player 5:** \"Player 6 is not the criminal.\" -  Again, could be true or false.\n*   **Player 6:** \"Player 2 is not the criminal.\" - Could be true or false.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nPlayer 4's statement is the most crucial here.

This further reinforces the idea that at least one of them is not an Investigator.\n4.  **Player 5:** Continues to say Player 6 is not the criminal. This consistency, combined with my initial assumption, could suggest they are an Investigator, but it could also be a Rumormonger or Lunatic.\n\nMy initial theory that Player 6 was the Investigator is being challenged by Player 6 now accusing me directly.

If Player 3 is a Rumormonger, their statement could be either true or false.\n\nPlayer 4 and 5's statements seem to be protecting each other. Player 6 is also accusing me, which could be truthful or deceptive.\n\nMy confidence in Player 2 being the criminal has strengthened due to their consistent misleading statements.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Playe"

The consistent \"not criminal\" statements from Players 2, 3, 5, and 6 are interesting. It's possible they are all Investigators, but it's also possible that some are Rumormongers or Lunatics.\n\n**My Current Suspicions:**\n\nI don't have enough information to confidently identify the Criminal. I'm going to assume Player 4 is a likely target of suspicion due to my accusation, and focus on observing how the others react in the next round.\n\n**Final Judgment:**\nFinal Criminal Is Player 4.\nMy Role "

This is a strong indication that Player 4 is either an Investigator or is being deliberately protected by multiple players. The fact that I accused Player 4 in Round 1 and now have multiple players defending them suggests they are either an Investigator or a very clever player who understands how to manipulate the situation.\n\nPlayer 2's statement contradicting my Round 1 accusation is also key. It shows they are paying attention and willing to challenge my claims. This could be an Investigator, or a Rumormonger trying to appear trustworthy.\n\n**My Current Suspicions:**\n\nI'm starting to suspect Player 4 is either an Investigator or a very perceptive player.

It's more probable that this is a coordinated effort, perhaps to shield the true Criminal.\n\nPlayer 4 continues to defend Player 2, and Player 6 defends Player 4.

Several other players (2, 4, 5, and 6) also stated that Player 3 is not the criminal. Player 3 stated that Player 4 is not the criminal.\n\nHere's my initial reasoning:\n\n*   **Player 3's Statement:** If Player 3 is the criminal, they might be trying to deflect suspicion by saying Player 4 isn't the criminal. If Player 3 is an Investigator, they're truthfully stating Player 4 isn't the criminal.\n*   **Multiple \"Not Criminal\" Statements on Player 3:** The fact that multiple players (including myself) said Player 3 isn't the criminal is interesting. If several Investigators are saying this, it's likely true. However, if there's a Rumormonger or Lunatic, they could be reinforcing a false belief.\n*   **Statements on Player 2:** Players 5 and 6 both said Player 2 is not the criminal. This could be a genuine observation, or a coordinated effort to mislead.\n\nBased on this limited information, I'm hesitant to accuse anyone definitively. I'll keep Player 3 under observation, but not immediately suspect them. The consensus around Player 3 being \"not the criminal\" is notable and makes me think they are not the criminal.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Unknown].\nMy Role Is I"

This reinforces the agreement around Player 4.\n*   **Player 6:** Says Player 4 is not the criminal. This is the final confirmation in a chain of statements about Player 4.\n\n**Final Deduction:**\n\nThe most striking element of Round 3 is the overwhelming consensus that Player 4 is *not* the criminal. Players 3, 4, 5, and 6 all explicitly state this. This strongly suggests that Player 4 is either an Investigator or is being protected (perhaps by a Rumormonger). The consistency across multiple rounds, especially the repeated assertions by Players 2, 3, and 4, indicates a pattern.\n\nThe fact that I, as the Criminal, have been consistently targeted, and that the group seems to be converging on an innocence claim for Player 4, suggests that my deception is working. Players are likely focusing on me and ignoring other potential suspects. This reinforces my initial assessment that I am, in fact, the Criminal. The agreement on Player 4 is likely to be a genuine assessment, or a coordinated effort to mislead.\n\n**Final Judgment:**\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or"

This strongly suggests at least one of them is an Investigator. It's possible they are both Investigators, or one is an Investigator and the other is a Rumormonger/Lunatic trying to follow along.\n*   **Player 4:** Agreed with my statement about Player 6. This makes them a suspect, either an Investigator or someone deliberately trying to cover for me or another player.\n*   **Player 3 & 6:** Made neutral statements.

This strongly suggests that at least three players are Investigators. Player 3's statement directly contradicts my claim about Player 5, which is expected if they are an Investigator. Player 4's statement remains unchanged, so it's less informative.\n\nThe fact that Player 5 accuses me of being the criminal, despite me claiming they are, is interesting. It could be an Investigator, or it could be a Lunatic who believes they are the Criminal and is making a truthful statement.\n\nGiven the consistency of Players 2, 5, and 6 accusing me, I'm increasingly confident that they are Investigators. Player 3's contradiction strengthens this belief.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role "

It could be three Lunatics, or a coordinated effort by non-Investigators.\n*   Player 2's statement about Player 6 contradicts the earlier statements from Players 3 and 4.

The fact that Player 6 has consistently made statements about others (Player 1 in Round 1, Player 3 in Round 2) without being directly implicated by anyone else raises a flag.\n\nGiven the multiple statements clearing me and Player 5, and the unusual dynamic between Players 3 and 5, I now suspect Player 6 is attempting to deflect suspicion and may be the Criminal.

This is unusual and suggests a coordinated effort, likely by the Criminal (Player 5) to solidify a false narrative. The consistent support across multiple players for the innocence of others is suspicious, especially given my earlier observations about Player 5's behavior.\n\nWhile it's possible that several Investigators are present, the degree of agreement, particularly after Player 5's initial accusation of Player 3, feels too strong to be purely coincidental. Player 5 continues to be the most likely candidate for the Criminal role, strategically trying to influence the group's perception. The other players, perhaps unknowingly, are being drawn into their web of deception.\n\n**Final Judgment:**\nFinal Criminal Is Player 5.\n"
