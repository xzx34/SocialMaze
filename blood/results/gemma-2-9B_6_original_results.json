Their claim that Player 6 is not the criminal is particularly interesting, as it doesn't align with the previous round's suspicions.  \n\n* **Player 5's Statement:** Player 5 is again stating that Player 1 is not the criminal. This reinforces the possibility that they are either a Rumormonger or a Lunatic. However, it's also possible that Player 5 is simply trying to throw off suspicion from themselves, knowing that they are the target of suspicion.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWhile Player 4's inconsistent behavior continues to make them a strong suspect, the new statements from Players 5 and 6 create some uncertainty.

This consistent statement, along with the support from other players, further supports the idea that Player 1 is not the Criminal.\n* **Player 3:** Claims Player 4 is not the criminal. This statement adds another layer of complexity, as it doesn't directly align with any previous accusations.\n* **Player 4:** Claims Player 1 is not the criminal. This statement aligns with the majority and reinforces the belief that Player 1 is not the Criminal.\n* **Player 5:** Claims Player 2 is not the criminal. This statement aligns with Player 1's and Player 4's statements and strengthens the case against Player 6 being the Criminal.\n* **Player 6:** Makes the final statement, accusing Player 1 of being the criminal. This contradicts all other players' statements and stands alone.\n\n**Final Observations:**\n\n* Player 6's final statement is the only one contradicting the majority. This strongly suggests Player 6 is the Criminal, attempting to sow doubt in the final round.\n* Players 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are aligned in their statements, creating a strong consensus that Player 6 is the Criminal.\n\n**Final Judgment - Round 3:**\n\nFinal Criminal Is Player 6.\nMy Role Is Investigator.\n\n\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nDespite the complexity introduced by some of the statements in Round 3, the overwhelming consistency of the other players' statements, coupled with Player 6's lone contradictory accusation, leads me to confidently confirm my previous judgment.  Player 6's behavior throughout the game strongly suggests they are the Criminal, attempting to mislead and manipulate the group."
