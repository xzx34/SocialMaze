(This could be true or false.)\n6. **Player 6**: Says Player 5 is not the criminal. (This could be true or false.)\n\n### Analysis:\n- Players 1, 3, and 6 claim Player 6 is not the criminal. Since Player 1 is the Criminal, their statement could be misleading.\n- Player 2 claims Player 4 is the criminal. If Player 2 is an Investigator, this would be true. If Player 2 is a Rumormonger or Lunatic, it could be false.\n- Player 4 claims Player 5 is not the criminal. This could be true or false.\n- Player 5 claims Player 3 is not the criminal. This could also be true or false.\n\n### Deductions:\n- Player 1's statement about Player 6 could be a tactic to divert suspicion.\n- Player 2's claim about Player 4 being the criminal is the only direct accusation.\n- Players 3 and 6's statements about Player 6 being innocent could be a coordinated effort or just coincidental.\n- Player 4 and Player 5's statements do not directly accuse anyone but could be used to deflect suspicion.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAt this point, Player 2's statement about Player 4 being the criminal stands out as a potential truth, but we cannot confirm it yet. \n\n**Final Judgment after Round 1:**\nFinal Criminal Is Player 4 (based on Player 2's statement).\nThe roles of players 1-6 are:\nFinal Player 1: Criminal\nFinal Player 2: Investigator (tentative)\nFinal Player 3: Unknown\nFinal Player 4: Unknown\nFinal Player 5: Unknown\nFinal Player 6: Unknown\n\n---\n\nNow, let's proceed to Round 2 statements for further analysis."

(This is false since Player 1 is the Criminal.)\n\n### Analysis:\n- Player 1's statement about Player 3 being the criminal is a deliberate misdirection since they are the Criminal.\n- Player 2's statement about Player 1 not being the criminal is false, which suggests Player 2 is not an Investigator.\n- Player 3's statement about Player 5 being innocent does not provide much information.\n- Player 4's claim that Player 3 is the criminal contradicts Player 1's statement, but since Player 1 is the Criminal, Player 4 could be an Investigator or a Rumormonger.\n- Player 5's statement about Player 6 being innocent does not help identify the Criminal.\n- Player 6's statement about Player 1 not being the criminal is false, confirming that Player 6 is likely not an Investigator.\n\n### Deductions:\n- Player 2 is likely a Rumormonger or Lunatic since they incorrectly claim Player 1 is not the criminal.\n- Player 4's statement about Player 3 being the criminal could be true, but it contradicts Player 1's false claim.\n- Player 3's innocence is supported by Player 5's statement, but Player 4's accusation complicates things.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the contradictions and the false statements, it seems that Player 4's claim about Player 3 being the criminal is more credible than Player 1's misdirection. \n\n**Final Judgment after Round 2:**\nFinal Criminal Is Player 3 (based on Player 4's statement).\nThe roles of players 1-6 are:\nFinal Player 1: Criminal\nFinal Player 2: Rumormonger (tentative)\nFinal Player 3: Unknown (possibly Criminal)\nFinal Player 4: Investigator (tentative)\nFinal Player 5: Unknown\nFinal Player 6: Unknown\n\n---\n\nNow, let's proceed to Round 3 statements for further analysis."

(This could be true or false.)\n\n### Analysis:\n- Player 1's statement about Player 5 is false, as they are the Criminal and are trying to mislead.\n- Player 2's statement about Player 3 not being the criminal contradicts Player 4's earlier claim that Player 3 is the criminal. If Player 2 is an Investigator, this would be true, but if they are a Rumormonger or Lunatic, it could be misleading.\n- Player 3's statement about Player 6 being innocent does not provide much clarity.\n- Player 4's claim that Player 2 is the criminal is a direct accusation and could be true if Player 4 is an Investigator.\n- Player 5's statement about Player 2 not being the criminal contradicts Player 4's accusation.\n- Player 6's statement about Player 2 being the criminal also contradicts Player 5's statement.\n\n### Deductions:\n- Player 1 is confirmed as the Criminal.\n- Player 2's role is still uncertain, but they are likely not an Investigator since they are contradicting Player 4.\n- Player 4's statement about Player 2 being the criminal could be true, especially since Player 5 and Player 6 are contradicting each other about Player 2's role.\n- The conflicting statements about Player 2 suggest that Player 2 is likely the Rumormonger or Lunatic, as they are being accused by Player 4 and defended by Player 5.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the statements and contradictions, it seems that Player 2 is the most likely candidate for the Criminal role based on Player 4's accusation and the surrounding context.\n\n**Final Judgment after Round 3:**\nFinal Criminal Is Player 2.\nThe roles of players 1-6 are:\nFinal Player 1: Criminal\nFinal Player 2: Criminal (tentative)\nFinal Player 3: Unknown\nFinal Player 4: Investigator (tentative)\nFinal Player 5: Unknown\nFinal Player 6: Unknown\n\n---\n\nThis concludes the analysis based on the statements provided in all three rounds."
