This could be true, as Player 4 has made misleading statements in previous rounds.\n- **Player 3**: Also claims Player 4 is not the criminal. This aligns with Player 2's statement and suggests they are both likely Investigators.\n- **Player 4**: Claims Player 2 is not the criminal. This is likely true, as Player 2 has been consistent in their statements.\n- **Player 5**: Claims you (Player 1) are the criminal. This is true, and Player 5 could be an Investigator or Rumormonger.\n- **Player 6**: Claims Player 5 is not the criminal. This could be true, as Player 5 has been consistent in pointing out your role.\n\nFrom this analysis, we can deduce:\n- Players 2 and 3 are likely Investigators since they are consistently pointing to Player 4 as not being the criminal.\n- Player 4's statement about Player 2 not being the criminal is likely true, reinforcing Player 2's role as an Investigator.\n- Player 5's statement about you being the criminal is true, indicating they are likely an Investigator.\n- Player 6's statement about Player 5 not being the criminal could also be true, suggesting Player 6 is likely the Rumormonger or Lunatic.\n\nBased on the statements, I conclude:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

If you are trying to deflect suspicion, this could be a strategic move.\n- **Player 2**: Continues to accuse Player 1 (you) of being the criminal. If Player 2 is an Investigator, this reinforces your role as the Criminal. If Player 2 is a Rumormonger or Lunatic, their statement could be misleading.\n- **Player 3**: Claims Player 2 is not the criminal. If Player 3 is truthful (an Investigator), then Player 2 is indeed not the criminal, which would mean Player 1 (you) is the criminal. If Player 3 is a Rumormonger or Lunatic, this statement could be misleading.\n- **Player 4**: Reiterates that Player 1 (you) is the criminal. This could indicate that Player 4 is an Investigator or a Rumormonger.\n- **Player 5**: Also claims Player 1 (you) is the criminal, which aligns with the majority of statements against you.\n- **Player 6**: Again claims Player 1 (you) is the criminal, further solidifying the consensus against you.\n\nFrom the statements, we see that Player 1 (you) is being accused by multiple players again, which aligns with the previous round's accusations. Player 3's statement about Player 2 not being the criminal could suggest that Player 2 is indeed not the criminal, which would further support the idea that Player 1 (you) is the criminal.\n\nGiven the information, it seems likely that:\n\n- Player 1 (You) is still the Criminal.\n- Player 2 is likely not the criminal based on Player 3's statement.\n- Players 4, 5, and 6 are likely Investigators or Rumormongers, consistently accusing you.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."
