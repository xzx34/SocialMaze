If multiple players are making the same claim, it's possible that they are either aligned as Investigators or that they are all confused or misled.\n- Player 3's claim about Player 4 not being the Criminal could be the key to determining roles, as it contradicts Player 4's statements and creates a conflict.\n- Player 4's statement about Player 2 being innocent could be a diversion if Player 4 is the Criminal.\n\nGiven all this, let's summarize the most likely roles:\n- Player 2, Player 5, and Player 6 are likely Investigators or Rumormongers based on their consistent claims about your innocence.\n- Player 4 seems to be in conflict with Player 3\u2019s statement, making them a suspect.\n- The possibility of Player 3 being a Lunatic or Rumormonger opens up the chance that they might be misled.\n\nAfter considering all statements across the three rounds, the most consistent evidence points to Player 4 still being the Criminal, as they are making contradictory statements and are surrounded by conflicting claims.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 4.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

If Player 3 is a Lunatic, they believe they are the Criminal and may be wrong. \n\n**Analyzing Player 2's statement:**\nPlayer 2's claim about Player 4 could be an attempt to mislead if Player 2 is a Rumormonger or Lunatic.\n\nAt this point, I have some conflicting statements, but Player 4's statement about me being not the criminal indicates they are likely not an Investigator. \n\nBased on the statements, I cannot definitively conclude who the Criminal is, but I suspect Player 3 might be the Investigator based on their claim about Player 5, as it\u2019s a more direct accusation rather than a defense.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 5.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

Since Player 3 has claimed Player 1 (me) is not the criminal, and I know I am, Player 3 is likely either a Rumormonger or a Lunatic.\n2. Player 4\u2019s claim that Player 3 is the criminal aligns with my accusation. If Player 4 is telling the truth, then Player 3 is indeed likely the criminal.\n3. Player 5's defense of Player 3 suggests they might be trying to protect Player 3, which raises suspicion of Player 5.\n\nGiven that both me and Player 4 are accusing Player 3, and Player 3 is trying to defend themselves by stating I am not the criminal, it seems the most logical conclusion is that Player 3 is the Criminal. \n\n### Final Conclusion:\nAfter analyzing all three rounds, Player 3 has inconsistently defended themselves while being accused by two players (myself and Player 4), which suggests they are the Criminal.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 3.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

The claims about Player 5 being the criminal and the claims about Player 3 being the criminal both come from multiple players, which suggests a need for further rounds of statements to clarify roles.\n\nSince you are aware you are the Criminal, you are trying to deflect suspicion away from yourself. \n\nBased on the current round:\n- Player 2 and Player 3 are providing statements that suggest they might be Investigators or Rumormongers.\n- Players 4 and 5 have conflicting views about Player 3.\n\nThus, I cannot definitively conclude who the Criminal is yet, but Player 3 is strongly indicated by multiple claims, while Player 5 is defended by Player 6.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player Unknown.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

(As the Criminal, this statement is likely misleading.)\n2. **Player 2**: Claims Player 4 is not the criminal. (If Player 2 is an Investigator, this is true; otherwise, it could be misleading.)\n3. **Player 3**: Claims Player 6 is the criminal. (This aligns with my statement, which raises the possibility that at least one of us is misleading.)\n4. **Player 4**: Claims Player 3 is not the criminal. (This could help clear Player 3, but we need to know Player 4's role.)\n5. **Player 5**: Claims Player 4 is not the criminal. (This aligns with Player 2's statement and suggests that at least one of them might be telling the truth.)\n6. **Player 6**: Claims Player 1 is not the criminal. (This could be misleading since I am the Criminal.)\n\n### Analysis:\n- Players 2 and 5 both assert that Player 4 is not the criminal, indicating they may have some credibility.\n- Players 1 and 3 point to Player 6 as the criminal; this could mean that either one of them is incorrect, or at least one of them is an Investigator pointing out the truth.\n- Player 4's statement about Player 3 adds uncertainty; if Player 4 is an Investigator, then Player 3 is safe. If Player 4 is a Rumormonger or Lunatic, this could be misleading.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the statements:\n- Players 2 and 5 are trying to clear Player 4, while Players 1 and 3 are both targeting Player 6. \n- Player 6's statement about me not being the criminal is suspicious, given that I am indeed the Criminal.\n\nAfter considering all the statements across the rounds, it seems likely that the players trying to clear Player 4 (Players 2 and 5) might be truth-tellers, thus Player 4 may not be the criminal. The accusations towards Player 6 from Players 1 and 3 are more compelling given the context of the other statements.\n\n**Final Judgment:**\nFinal Criminal Is Player 6.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

Since Player 3 says I'm not the criminal, their statement can be seen as false. \n\nHence, the claims regarding Player 4 and Player 6 may indicate they are either Investigators or Rumormongers, but more information is needed to clarify their roles.\n\nFinal Judgment after Round 1:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 4 (based on Player 1's statement).\nMy Role Is Criminal."

(Could be true or false)\n\nFrom my statement, I have confirmed that Player 3 is the criminal. \n\nNow, let's analyze the implications of these statements:\n\n- Player 3's statement about me being the criminal must be false, which confirms Player 3 is lying. This fits with my assertion that Player 3 is indeed the criminal.\n- Player 2's statement about Player 3 also aligns with my finding, meaning Player 2 could potentially be an Investigator or Rumormonger.\n- Player 4's statement confirms I am not the criminal, which is true.\n- Player 5's statement about Player 2 being the criminal is inconsistent with my knowledge. Since Player 2 is not the criminal, Player 5 could either be a Rumormonger or the Lunatic.\n- Player 6's statement again supports my claim that Player 3 is the criminal.\n\nSo, based on the statements in Round 2, we can conclude:\n- Player 1: Investigator\n- Player 2: Not the criminal\n- Player 3: Confirmed as the criminal\n- Player 4: Likely truthful, so not the criminal, could be Investigator or Rumormonger\n- Player 5: Likely not an Investigator, could be Rumormonger or Lunatic\n- Player 6: Likely truthful, supporting my assertion about Player 3 being the criminal\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 3.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

However, we cannot definitively determine yet who the criminal is since we have conflicting claims.\n\n**Next deduction**:\n- Since you are an Investigator and have confirmed Player 5 is not the criminal, and there is a significant conflict around Player 4, Player 4 seems the most likely candidate for the criminal based on the majority of statements that point towards them.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 4.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

As an Investigator, you must provide truthful information, which leads to a contradiction in your claim about Player 5 being the criminal.\n- Player 2 maintains their claim that Player 4 is not the criminal, aligning with their previous Round 1 statement. \n- Player 3's statement in Round 2 (that Player 5 is not the criminal) contradicts your statement, which could mean either you or Player 3 is incorrect.\n- Player 4's statement about Player 6 adds another layer of uncertainty.\n- Player 5's statement again points to Player 4 being the criminal, which still aligns with their potential guilt based on prior statements.\n- Player 6's new accusation of Player 3 adds confusion to the mix.\n\nGiven the contradiction in your own statement, it raises the possibility that you may not be functioning under the Investigator's truthfulness in this round. However, since you are told you are an Investigator, we must analyze the implications of the statements of others.\n\nBased on the statements:\n- If Player 5 is indeed the criminal, it would fit with Player 1's statement and Player 3's support for Player 5 being innocent. \n- Player 4 continues to receive accusations from Players 5 and 2.\n- Player 6's accusation of Player 3 introduces doubt about Player 3's role.\n\nConsidering the totality of the statements and your role as an Investigator, it seems more likely that:\n- If you are an Investigator and should tell the truth, then Player 5 being the criminal cannot be possible if Player 3 is telling the truth about Player 5 not being the criminal.\n- Therefore, the most consistent conclusion across the rounds points toward Player 4 possibly being the criminal, despite your contradictory statement.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 4.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

Since you know you are the Criminal, Player 2's claim about Player 5 could also be strategic. \n\nHowever, since multiple players are saying Player 5 is not the criminal, and you are claiming Player 2 is the criminal, it seems more plausible that Player 2 is not the criminal based on the consensus about Player 5.\n\nI am still unsure about the roles of some players, but I feel more confident that Player 5 might be innocent, and Player 2 could be the Criminal based on the information provided.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 2.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

(This contradicts Players 3 and 4.)\n\n### Analyzing Statements:\n- You (Player 1) claim Player 2 is the criminal. Given that you are the Criminal, this is a self-serving statement aimed at deflecting suspicion. \n- Player 2 claims that Player 5 is not the criminal, which, if true, would conflict with Players 3 and 4's claims that Player 5 is the criminal.\n- Players 3 and 4 both assert that Player 5 is the criminal. If both of them are telling the truth, it suggests Player 5 is indeed the Criminal, but we know there is only one Criminal.\n- Player 5's claim that you are the Criminal aligns with your knowledge of your role. This does not provide new information as it confirms what you already know.\n- Player 6 claiming that Player 5 is not the criminal contradicts the statements made by Players 3 and 4.\n\n### Deductions:\n- If Players 3 and 4 are both correct in stating that Player 5 is the criminal, then Player 2\u2019s claim must be false, and Player 5 must be lying about you, which would make Player 5 not the Criminal, contradicting Players 3 and 4.\n- Given the conflicting statements, it seems more likely that Player 5 is not the Criminal since multiple players (3 and 4) claim that Player 5 is the Criminal. However, this cannot be true, as there can only be one Criminal. \n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven that you know you are the Criminal, the statements are more complex. The consensus seems to lean towards Player 5 being the focus of suspicion, but the contradictions suggest that Players 3 and 4 might be either Rumormongers or Lunatics. \n\nSince you are aware of your role, Player 2's statement about Player 5 not being the Criminal seems to align with your own interest in shifting blame, and Player 5\u2019s claim about you being the Criminal is merely an attempt to save themselves.\n\nTherefore, based on the statements and your role:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 5.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

Players 1, 2, and 5 seem to align against Player 3. Player 4 is pointing towards Player 2 as the potential Criminal, while Player 6 contradicts that.\n\nSince you are the Criminal, we cannot trust any statements you made. The most significant piece of information is that Player 4 is claiming Player 2 is the Criminal, and Player 6's statement supports that Player 2 is not the Criminal. \n\nGiven that Player 4's statement is a potential indicator of guilt, and since you are aware of your own role, we can deduce Player 2's role more clearly. Player 3's claim about you not being the Criminal is invalid, indicating they might be mistaken about their identity.\n\nTaking all this into account, I would conclude:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 2.\nMy Role Is Criminal."
