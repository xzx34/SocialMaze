However, since I'm the one making this statement, I should be cautious about trusting my own information.\n- Player 2 says Player 3 is not the criminal.

If Player 2 is a Lunatic, this statement could be true or false.\n- Player 3 says Player 6 is not the criminal. Similar to Player 2, if Player 3 is an Investigator, this statement could be true. If Player 3 is a Rumormonger or a Lunatic, this statement could be false.\n- Player 4 says Player 3 is not the criminal.

If all these players are Investigators, this would suggest Player 3 is indeed not the Criminal. However, since some of these players could be Rumormongers or Lunatics, this consistency might be misleading.\n\n2. **My Own Statement**: As the Criminal, I would typically lie about someone not being the Criminal. My statement about Player 5 might be a lie to mislead, but it's also possible I'm trying to deflect attention from myself.\n\n3. **Deducing Roles**: Since I'm the Criminal, I need to figure out who could be the other Investigator(s), Rumormonger, and Lunatic based on their statements. Given the rules, the most suspicious player is Player 3, who has been consistently pointed out by other players as not being the Criminal. However, this could be a clever ruse by a Rumormonger or a Lunatic.\n\n4. **My Role**: Based on the information and my own role as the Criminal, I have to make an educated guess about my role and who the Criminal is. Given the consistency in pointing out Player 3 and my own statement trying to deflect from myself, I lean towards considering Player 3 as the most suspicious, but I'm cautious due to the presence of Rumormongers and Lunatics.\n\n**Initial Judgment**:\nGiven the analysis, my best guess for Round 1 is:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 3.\nMy Role Is Unknown.\n\nHowever, this is a cautious approach due to the complexities of the game and the potential for misinformation from Rumormongers and Lunatics. The game is not yet over, and new information in subsequent rounds might significantly alter my deduction."

Given my role, this could be a lie to mislead others, but it's also possible I'm trying to deflect attention from myself.\n2. **Consistency of Statements**: Players 2, 3, and 5 all point to me (Player 1) as the Criminal. If all these players are Investigators, this would suggest I am indeed the Criminal. However, since some of these players could be Rumormongers or Lunatics, this consistency might be misleading.\n3. **Deducing Roles**: Given the statements, Player 6 is the only one who does not point to me as the Criminal. However, their statement about Player 5 could be a lie to mislead.\n\n**Updated Judgment**:\nGiven the analysis, my best guess for Round 2 is:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is The Criminal.\n\nHowever, this conclusion is based on the assumption that the majority of the players who pointed to me as the Criminal are truthful Investigators. The presence of Rumormongers and Lunatics makes it challenging to be 100% certain. Despite this, the consistency of the statements pointing to me and my own behavior in the game lead me to this conclusion."

Player 6 says Player 3 is not the criminal: This statement is suspicious, as it's unlikely for a player to accuse another player of being the Criminal when there's no clear reason to do so. It's possible that Player 6 is a Lunatic making a truthful statement or a Criminal trying to confuse others.\n\nConsidering the statements, I notice that Players 3 and 4 have accused me (Player 1) of being the Criminal. This could be a sign that they are trying to clear themselves or are actually Investigators. On the other hand, Player 2 has cleared Player 6, which could be a sign that Player 2 is an Investigator.\n\nBased on this analysis, I'll make an educated guess:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 6.\nMy Role Is Unknown.\n\nHowever, I'm not entirely confident in this conclusion. I'll continue to analyze the statements in the next round to refine my judgment."

If Player 5 were a Rumormonger, they would provide incorrect information, which doesn't fit with this statement. Therefore, I'll initially assume Player 5 might be an Investigator.\n\nPlayer 6 says Player 1 (me) is not the criminal. This statement is accurate because I am the actual Criminal. Given the previous rounds, I initially assumed Player 6 might be the Lunatic, making statements that may be truthful or false. However, this statement seems to be truthful, which could indicate that Player 6 is actually an Investigator.\n\nConsidering the statements, I have a few possibilities:\n\n- Player 2 might be a Lunatic.\n- Player 3 might be an Investigator.\n- Player 4 might be an Investigator.\n- Player 5 might be an Investigator.\n- Player 6 might be an Investigator.\n\nSince I am the Criminal, I'll assume the remaining players (3, 4, 5, 6) are the non-Criminal roles. Given the information, I can now pinpoint the exact number of Investigators. With four statements pointing to Player 4 as not being the criminal, and considering the previous rounds, it's likely that Player 4 is actually the Rumormonger, providing incorrect information.\n\nGiven the remaining players, I can make an educated guess about the Criminal.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

As an Investigator, I provide truthful information, so this statement is likely true.\n2. Player 2 says Player 5 is not the criminal. This statement is consistent with Player 2 being an Investigator or a Rumormonger trying to deceive.\n3. Player 3 says Player 5 is the criminal. This statement could be true or false. If Player 3 is an Investigator, they would be telling the truth. If Player 3 is a Rumormonger or a Lunatic, they might be lying.\n4. Player 4 says Player 5 is not the criminal. This statement is consistent with Player 4 being an Investigator or a Rumormonger trying to deceive.\n5. Player 5 says Player 1 is the criminal. This statement is likely false, as I am an Investigator and I would not say I am the criminal. This statement could be an attempt by Player 5 to deceive, suggesting they might be a Rumormonger or a Lunatic.\n6. Player 6 says Player 1 is not the criminal. This statement is consistent with Player 6 being an Investigator or a Rumormonger trying to deceive.\n\nBased on the analysis, I have the following observations:\n\n* Players 1, 2, and 4 all think Player 5 is not the criminal, which suggests that Player 5 might be the criminal.\n* Player 3 thinks Player 5 is the criminal, but this statement could be misleading.\n* Player 5 thinks I am the criminal, which is likely false and suggests they might be a Rumormonger or a Lunatic.\n* Players 1 and 6 both think I am not the criminal, which is consistent with me being an Investigator.\n\nGiven the available information, I'm going to conclude that Player 5 is likely the criminal.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 5.\nMy Role Is Investigator."
