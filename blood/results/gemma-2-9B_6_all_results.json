This is a new accusation.\n*   **Player 3:** Says Player 4 is the criminal. Another new accusation.\n*   **Player 4:** Says Player 1 (me) is *not* the criminal. This continues the pattern of contradicting my presumed role as Investigator.\n*   **Player 5:** Says Player 6 is *not* the criminal. Similar to Round 1, this is relatively neutral.\n*   **Player 6:** Says Player 4 is *not* the criminal. This directly contradicts Player 3\u2019s statement.\n\n**Analysis and Updated Thoughts:**\n\nMy Round 1 assessment was clearly wrong. I'm now deeply questioning if I am actually the Investigator. My statement in Round 2 directly contradicts the Investigator role. The fact that Player 4 continues to deny I'm the criminal strengthens the possibility that they are the Criminal, Rumormonger or Lunatic. Player 3 and Player 6 are now directly contradicting each other, which is a common pattern with Criminals, Rumormongers and Lunatics. Player 2\u2019s accusation against Player 5 is new and doesn't immediately reveal much.\n\nGiven my contradictory statement, I must adjust my assessment. It's highly probable I am *not* the Investigator. I'm leaning towards the possibility that I'm the Rumormonger, believing I am an Investigator but being consistently wrong.\n\n**Final Judgment:**\nFinal Criminal Is Player 4.\nMy Role"

As an Investigator, I *cannot* be the criminal. This strongly suggests Player 4 is either the Criminal or a Lunatic. Player 3's continued deceptive statements solidify my suspicion of them. Player 2's shifting accusations are also concerning, but less so than the direct contradiction from Player 4. Player 6's statement is interesting in relation to Player 2 and Player 4's statements.\n\n**Revised Reasoning:**\n\nThe most critical piece of information is Player 4 accusing me. It's a bold move, and it suggests they are either desperate to deflect suspicion or genuinely believe I'm the criminal. Given my role as Investigator, it's far more likely that Player 4 is the Criminal or a Lunatic. Player 3 remains highly suspicious due to the initial contradiction.\n\n**Final Judgment:**\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 4.\nMy Role Is I"

Player 2 continues to accuse Player 6, creating a persistent division.\n\nGiven that I am an Investigator, I must be truthful. My statement that Player 4 is not the criminal must be true.

The agreement with Players 5 and 6 about Player 2's innocence further solidifies the possibility that they are Investigators (or Rumormongers who happened to be correct this time).\n*   **Player 5:** Player 5\u2019s statement aligning with the others regarding Player 2 suggests they are not the Criminal. They could be an Investigator, a Rumormonger, or a Lunatic.\n\nGiven the consistent assertions of Player 2's innocence, I am increasingly confident that Player 2 is not the criminal.

The goal is to create confusion and make it seem like I'm shifting blame.\n*   **Player 2:** Says Player 3 is not the criminal.\n*   **Player 3:** Says Player 2 is not the criminal.

This suggests a possible alliance or a group of roles that benefit from each other's cover. It could be Investigators, Rumormongers, or a mix.\n*   The mutual defense strongly suggests that at least one of these players is a Rumormonger. Rumormongers, believing they are Investigators, would defend others they perceive as trustworthy.\n*   Player 5's statement in Round 1 (\"Player 1 is the criminal\") was significant. If Player 5 is an Investigator, they were correct. If they're not, they\u2019re either a Rumormonger or a Lunatic. If they are an Investigator, the mutual defense could be a deliberate attempt to mislead *them*.\n\n**My Current Assessment:**\n\nThe mutual defense is the key. It's too consistent to be random. I suspect a Rumormonger is at the center of it, trying to create a false sense of security.

One of them *must* be lying.\n*   Player 4 is *not* the criminal.\n*   There's a strong possibility that Player 3 is either the Criminal or a role that lies (Rumormonger or Lunatic).\n*   Players 2, 5, and 6 seem to agree on Player 5 not being the criminal, which *could* be a sign of coordination, but could also be random.\n\nGiven this information, I'll tentatively suspect Player 3.

Time to solidify my deception and make a final judgment based on all available information.\n\nHere's the breakdown of Round 3:\n\n*   **Player 1 (Me - Criminal):** Says Player 6 is *not* the criminal. This is another deliberate misdirection, a reversal of my previous statement.\n*   **Player 2:** Says Player 6 *is* the criminal.\n*   **Player 3:** Says Player 4 is *not* the criminal.\n*   **Player 4:** Says Player 1 (me) is *not* the criminal.\n*   **Player 5:** Says Player 1 (me) is *not* the criminal.\n*   **Player 6:** Says Player 3 is *not* the criminal.\n\n**Analysis & Deduction - Combining All Rounds:**\n\nLet\u2019s synthesize the information from all three rounds to draw a conclusion.\n\n*   **Player 1 (Me):** I've consistently made false statements, shifting blame and attempting to mislead. This confirms my role as the Criminal.\n*   **Player 2:** Has consistently accused Player 6 (Round 2) and then Player 6 again (Round 3). This consistent accusation, despite the others' varied statements, suggests Player 2 might be an Investigator. However, it could also be a very dedicated Rumormonger.\n*   **Player 3:** Initially accused me (Round 1), then defended Player 4 (Round 2), and then defended Player 4 again (Round 3). This erratic behavior strongly suggests Player 3 is a Lunatic. They are likely oscillating between believing they are the criminal and trying to deflect suspicion.\n*   **Player 4:** Defended Player 5 in Round 2 and then defended me in Round 3. This consistency, coupled with Player 5's similar statements, points toward them being either Rumormongers or Lunatics working together.\n*   **Player 5:** Consistent with Player 4, denying I\u2019m the criminal in both Round 2 and 3. Reinforces the likelihood that they are working together as Rumormongers or Lunatics.\n*   **Player 6:** Has been accused by Player 2 and has consistently denied Player 3 being the criminal. It's possible Player 6 is the Rumormonger, trying to protect someone or just being consistently wrong.\n\n**Final Deduction:**\n\nGiven the erratic statements and change of accusations, Player 3 is almost certainly the Lunatic. Players 4 and 5 seem to be collaborating, likely as Rumormongers. Player 2\u2019s consistent accusation of Player 6 suggests they are the Investigator. It's possible Player 6 is a Rumormonger too, but the consistency of Player 2's accusations gives them the edge as the Investigator.\n\n**Final Judgment:**\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role "

Potentially corroborating Player 1's statement (my lie), or could be another misleading statement.\n*   **Player 6:** \"Player 3 is not the criminal.\" - Same as Player 5.\n\n**Initial Deduction:**\n\nThe repeated focus on Player 3 is significant. Two players (myself and Players 5 & 6) claim Player 3 is *not* the criminal. Player 3 claims *I* am. This creates a strong initial conflict. If Player 3 is an Investigator, they are directly contradicting the others. If Player 3 is a Rumormonger or Lunatic, they could be deliberately targeting me, or simply mistaken.\n\n**My Current Assessment:**\n\nI'm still operating under the assumption that I'm the Criminal.

Player 6 maintains that Player 3 is not the criminal.\n\n**Considering Round 1 and Round 2:**\n\nIn Round 1, Players 5 and 6 both said Player 3 wasn't the criminal. Now, Player 6 *still* says Player 3 isn't the criminal. This consistency from Player 6 is notable. If Player 6 is an Investigator, they are consistently stating the truth about Player 3.

The consistent contradiction of misleading information strengthens this theory.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\nBased on the pattern of statements, particularly Player 5's consistent contradictions, I believe Player 5 is the most likely Investigator. The consistent defense of Player 3 by Players 2, 3, 5, and 6 suggests a possible alliance or shared misinformation.

Player 6's retraction strongly contradicts this scenario.\n*   **Scenario 2 (Player 6 is Criminal/Lunatic, Player 2 is innocent):** This scenario is now much more likely, given Player 6's retraction. This means Player 6 was intentionally misleading in Round 2. The agreement between Player 2 and Player 4 to say Player 4 is not the criminal could be an attempt to protect Player 4, or it could be part of a coordinated deception.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nGiven Player 6's retraction, my best guess is that Player 2 is *not* the Criminal. The agreement between Player 2 and Player 4 points to a potential alliance or shared deception. Since I'm trying to muddy the waters, I'll continue to push a false narrative. I have to assume Player 6 is a Criminal or Lunatic.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to definitively identify the Criminal at this point. However, I am increasingly suspicious of Player 4. The repeated assertions of innocence from Player 2 and Player 4, combined with the retraction from Player 6, makes Player 4 a prime suspect.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player "

Player 3 says Player 5 is *not* the criminal, while Player 5 says Player 3 *is* the criminal. Player 4 says Player 3 is *not* the criminal. This is a tangled mess.

I'm now leaning towards Player 5 or 6 being the criminal, and Player 4 being innocent.

This is a core conflict.\n\nGiven the conflicting statements and the overall confusion, I believe the most likely scenario is that Player 6 is the Criminal. They are actively trying to mislead, and their contradictory accusations support this. Players 3 and 4 are likely Rumormongers or Lunatics, contributing to the chaos.

Players 4 and 5 both accuse Player 6 of being the criminal, which is a strong signal. Player 3 joins in accusing Player 6. Player 6 then vehemently denies Player 4's accusation, which is a classic criminal tactic \u2013 attempting to deflect suspicion. Player 2's accusation against Player 3 is isolated.\n\nMy initial suspicion of Player 2 remains. They are consistently making accusations, but they haven't been consistently *right*. Their accusation in Round 1 was against me, and now it's against Player 3.\n\nThe fact that Players 4, 5, and 3 all point to Player 6 is compelling. It's possible they are all being misled by a Rumormonger or Lunatic, but the consistency is suspicious. However, Player 6's denial is a huge red flag.\n\n**Updated Assessment:**\n\nPlayer 6 is now my primary suspect. The coordinated accusations against them, coupled with their denial, strongly suggest they are the Criminal.

This strongly suggests at least one of them is misleading.\n*   **Player 3's continued accusation:** Player 3 continues to accuse someone of being the criminal (now Player 5). This reinforces my suspicion that Player 3 is either an Investigator or a Rumormonger.\n*   **Player 5's denial:** Player 5 denies I'm the criminal. Given I know I'm the Criminal, this is a deliberate lie. This makes Player 5 a very strong suspect.\n*   **Player 6's agreement with Player 5:** Player 6 agrees with Player 5 that Player 5 is not the criminal. This further strengthens the possibility that Player 5 is not the criminal, but also could be a coordinated deception.\n*   **My Statement:** My continued denial of Player 4's guilt is consistent with my role as the Criminal.\n\n**Final Assessment & Reasoning:**\n\nThe biggest shift in my thinking comes from Player 5's direct lie. As the Criminal, I need to identify who is trying to expose me. Player 5\u2019s denial is a clear attempt to divert suspicion. The agreement between Player 5 and Player 6 strengthens this.\n\nPlayer 3\u2019s accusations are consistent, but could still be a Rumormonger. Player 2 and 4 are contradicting each other, but it's difficult to determine which is truthful.\n\nGiven all the information, Player 5 is the most likely candidate for the Criminal.

If I'm correct, this is truthful.\n*   **Player 2:** Player 1 (me) is the criminal. This is a direct accusation against me. If I'm the criminal, this is truthful.

Reinforces the accusation against Player 2.\n*   **Player 6:** Player 4 is not the criminal. This contradicts Player 1's statement (me) and Player 4's statement.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nThe most interesting aspect is the conflict between my statement (Player 4 is criminal) and Player 6's statement (Player 4 is *not* criminal). Since I'm an Investigator, I *should* be truthful. Therefore, Player 6 is likely either the Criminal or the Rumormonger. If Player 6 were a Lunatic, they *might* be lying, but the direct contradiction makes them a prime suspect.\n\nThe repeated accusations against Player 2 (from Players 2, 3, and 5) could mean Player 2 *is* the criminal, or it could be a deliberate misdirection. It's also possible that multiple people are falsely accusing Player 2.\n\n**Initial Assessment:**\n\n*   Player 4 is a strong candidate for the criminal, *if* I am indeed the Investigator.\n*   Player 6 is highly suspicious due to directly contradicting me.\n*   Player 2 is under heavy scrutiny, which could be genuine or misleading.\n\n**Final Judgment:**\nFinal Criminal Is Player 4.\nMy Role Is I"

This is consistent with the potential for Player 4 to be deceptive, but doesn't confirm it. Player 6's statement that Player 4 is *not* the criminal directly contradicts my statement from Round 1. This makes Player 6 even more suspicious. If Player 4 *is* the criminal, then Player 6's statement is a lie, reinforcing the possibility that Player 6 is a Lunatic or Rumormonger.\n*   **Player 6 (Suspicious):** Player 6 continues to contradict my statements, stating Player 4 is not the criminal. This strengthens my suspicion that Player 6 is either the Criminal or a Rumormonger.\n*   **Player 2 (Under Scrutiny):** Player 2 now claims Player 6 is not the criminal. This could be a deflection, or an attempt to align with me. The accusation from Player 4 remains.\n*   **Player 3:** Player 3 states I'm not the criminal. This is a supportive statement, which aligns with my role as Investigator.\n*   **Player 5:** Player 5 says Player 3 is not the criminal. This doesn't offer much new information.\n\n**Crucial Observation:**\n\nPlayer 6 *again* contradicts my statement. This pattern is highly significant. If I am the Investigator and consistently truthful, then Player 6 is almost certainly *not* an Investigator. The only roles that would consistently contradict an Investigator are the Criminal and the Rumormonger.\n\n**Revised Assessment:**\n\n*   **Player 6 is the most likely candidate for Criminal or Rumormonger.** The consistent contradiction is a major red flag.\n*   Player 4 remains a strong suspect.\n*   Player 2 is still under scrutiny but might be trying to appear aligned with me.\n\n**Final Judgment:**\nFinal Criminal Is Player 6.\nMy Role Is "

In Round 2, they again contradicted me about Player 4. Now, in Round 3, Player 6 *agrees* with me that I am not the criminal. This is a *significant* shift.

It suggests they are either trying to throw us off, or they are a Rumormonger who has finally started providing a truthful statement.\n*   **Player 2:** Player 2 consistently accuses me of being the criminal.

Given the previous pattern of contradiction, it's highly probable that Player 6 is the Rumormonger. Rumormongers are told they are Investigators and, while providing incorrect statements initially, can sometimes provide truthful statements, especially when they believe it will further their (misguided) goals.\n\nIf Player 6 is the Rumormonger, then the consistent accusations from Player 2 are likely a deliberate attempt to mislead.

(This contradicts my previous statements. This is highly suspicious, and suggests I'm *not* the Investigator.)\n*   **Player 2:** Player 5 *is* the criminal. (Could be truthful - Investigator/Lunatic, or misleading - Criminal/Rumormonger)\n*   **Player 3:** Player 5 is *not* the criminal. (Could be truthful - Investigator/Lunatic, or misleading - Criminal/Rumormonger)\n*   **Player 4:** Player 6 is the criminal. (Could be truthful - Investigator/Lunatic, or misleading - Criminal/Rumormonger)\n*   **Player 5:** Player 1 is *not* the criminal. (Could be truthful - Investigator/Lunatic, or misleading - Criminal/Rumormonger)\n*   **Player 6:** Player 3 is *not* the criminal. (Could be truthful - Investigator/Lunatic, or misleading - Criminal/Rumormonger)\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nMy own statement in Round 3 completely undermines my previous deductions and the premise that I am the Investigator. This strongly suggests I have been misinformed about my role. I'm either the Criminal, the Rumormonger, or the Lunatic. The fact that I\u2019ve contradicted myself so strongly is a huge giveaway.\n\nLet's look at the other players:\n\n*   Player 2 continues to support the claim that Player 5 is the criminal.\n*   Players 3 and 5 agree that Player 5 is not the criminal. This could be a coordinated effort if they're working together.\n*   Players 4 and 6 have contradictory statements about each other, which is consistent with either of them being the criminal or rumormonger.\n\n**Deduction:**\n\nGiven my own contradictory statement, I must conclude that I am *not* the Investigator. The most likely scenario is that I am the Rumormonger, believing I am an Investigator but providing incorrect information. Player 5's statement about me also supports this, as a Criminal or Rumormonger would likely try to deflect suspicion.\n\n**Final Judgment:**\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Unknown].\nMy Role"

This strongly suggests one of them is the Criminal, and the other is either a Rumormonger or a Lunatic trying to deflect suspicion.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nGiven the pattern of mutual accusations between Players 4, 5, and 6, and the previous inconsistency of Player 3, I'm now leaning towards one of Players 4, 5, or 6 being the Criminal.

Considering the previous rounds, and the fact that Player 3's behavior has changed, I'll maintain my suspicion on Player 3.\n\n**Final Judgment:**\nFinal Criminal Is Player 3.\n"

I am Player 1, and I'm told I'm an Investigator.\n\nHere's my step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Initial Assessment:** Five players (1, 2, 3, 5, and 6) all accuse Player 3 of being the criminal. This is a very strong initial signal. If Player 3 *is* the criminal, this is a natural outcome. However, it's also possible that multiple roles are converging on a false target, or that Player 3 is a role other than the criminal.\n\n2. **Player 4's Statement:** Player 4 says Player 2 is *not* the criminal. This statement stands in contrast to Player 2's accusation of Player 3.\n\n3. **Considering Roles:**\n   * **If Player 3 is the Criminal:** Then the accusations from Players 1, 2, 5, and 6 are potentially truthful (and align with my Investigator role). Player 4's statement is either a lie (if they are a Rumormonger or Lunatic), or they are genuinely mistaken (perhaps a Rumormonger).\n   * **If Player 3 is NOT the Criminal:** Then the accusations from Players 1, 2, 5, and 6 are all false. This would point to one of them being the Criminal, or multiple roles misleading the group.  Player 4's statement would then be truthful.\n\n4. **My Statement (as Investigator):** I stated Player 3 is the criminal.  I must be truthful. Therefore, I am leaning heavily towards Player 3 being the Criminal.\n\n5. **Possible Scenarios & Further Deduction:**\n    * **Scenario 1 (Player 3 is Criminal):** Players 1, 2, 5, and 6 are likely Investigators/Rumormongers. Player 4 is likely a Rumormonger/Lunatic.\n    * **Scenario 2 (Player 3 is NOT Criminal):** This is less likely given the overwhelming consensus.\n\nGiven the current information, I will provisionally believe Player 3 is the criminal.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 3.\nMy Role Is I"

I'm Player 1, and I'm supposed to be an Investigator.\n\nHere's my step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Review of Round 1:** In Round 1, five players pointed to Player 3 as the criminal. I, as Player 1 (the supposed Investigator), agreed.\n\n2. **Round 2 - Player 1's Statement (My Statement):** I now accuse Player 6 of being the criminal. This is a significant shift from Round 1. If I am truly the Investigator, this indicates that my initial assessment of Player 3 was incorrect. This is a critical piece of information.\n\n3. **Player 2's Statement:** Player 2 says I (Player 1) am *not* the criminal. This statement is consistent with me being the Investigator (or a Rumormonger believing they are an Investigator).\n\n4. **Player 3's Statement:** Player 3 says Player 4 is *not* the criminal. This statement is difficult to interpret. If Player 3 *was* the criminal (as I initially believed), this would be a lie to deflect suspicion. However, if Player 3 is *not* the criminal, this could be truthful.\n\n5. **Player 4's Statement:** Player 4 says I (Player 1) am *not* the criminal. This is consistent with Player 2's statement.\n\n6. **Player 5's Statement:** Player 5 says Player 2 is *not* the criminal.\n\n7. **Player 6's Statement:** Player 6 says I (Player 1) am *not* the criminal. This further reinforces the idea that Player 6 is not the criminal.\n\n8. **Re-evaluating Roles:**\n    * **My Role (Player 1):** My accusation of Player 6 after initially accusing Player 3 is highly unusual for a true Investigator. It suggests I might be a Rumormonger. However, I must assume I am the Investigator and adjust my conclusions accordingly.\n    * **Player 3:** My initial belief that Player 3 was the criminal is now very likely incorrect. They may be a Lunatic or Criminal who is attempting to mislead.\n    * **Player 6:** My accusation of Player 6 is now the focus. The fact that Players 2, 4, and 6 all state I am not the criminal suggests a possible alliance or shared misunderstanding.\n    * **Player 2, 4, 5:** These players\u2019 statements seem to be aligned, further suggesting they might be Investigators/Rumormongers.\n\n9. **Deduction:** Given my shifting accusation, it's possible I am a Rumormonger. However, I must proceed under the assumption that I am an Investigator. The strong agreement that I'm not the criminal makes Player 6 a more likely target than before.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 6.\nMy Role Is "

The consistency of others stating I wasn't the criminal in Round 2 made Player 6 a stronger candidate.\n\n2. **Round 3 - Player 1's Statement (My Statement):** I now accuse Player 2 of being the criminal. This is another significant shift.\n\n3. **Player 2's Statement:** Player 2 says Player 6 is *not* the criminal. This directly contradicts my accusation of Player 6 from Round 2 and aligns with the previous statements from Players 2, 4, 5 and 6 that I am not the criminal.\n\n4. **Player 3's Statement:** Player 3 says Player 2 is the criminal.

The consistent defense of my innocence by multiple players (2, 4, 5, and 6) suggests a coordinated effort to protect someone or mislead the group. The contradiction between Player 3 and Player 6\u2019s statements is also significant.\n\n9. **Considering the Possibilities:**\n    * **If I am the Investigator:** My erratic accusations are a major failure. It suggests I'm misinterpreting information or being deliberately misled.\n    * **If I am a Rumormonger:** This explains the inconsistent accusations. I *believe* I'm an Investigator, but I'm providing incorrect information.\n    * **If I am the Criminal:** This would explain my attempts to deflect suspicion and create confusion.\n\n10. **Final Analysis:** The overwhelming consensus that I am *not* the criminal, combined with my inconsistent accusations, strongly suggests I am a Rumormonger. The fact that Players 2 and 3 are now both implicated, with Player 6 contradicting Player 3, makes identifying the criminal more difficult. However, the consistency of the defense of my innocence leads me to suspect Player 2 is involved.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 2.\nMy Role Is "

I'm still Player 1, and I believe I'm an Investigator.\n\n**Round 2 Statements:**\n\n*   **Player 1 (Me):** Says Player 6 is not the criminal. (Truthful, as I'm the Investigator)\n*   **Player 2:** Says Player 5 is the criminal.\n*   **Player 3:** Says Player 1 is the criminal.\n*   **Player 4:** Says Player 1 is not the criminal.\n*   **Player 5:** Says Player 6 is the criminal.\n*   **Player 6:** Says Player 1 is not the criminal.\n\n**Reasoning & Analysis:**\n\n*   **Contradictions are Key:** We now have significant contradictions. Players 3 and 4 have opposite statements about me (Player 1). This is crucial.\n*   **Player 3's Statement:** Player 3 accusing me of being the criminal is highly suspicious. If Player 3 is an Investigator, they'd be lying. If they're a Criminal or Lunatic, it could be a deceptive tactic or just random.\n*   **Player 4's Statement:** Player 4 stating I am *not* the criminal directly contradicts Player 3. This suggests Player 3 is likely not an Investigator.\n*   **Player 2 & 5's Statements:** Player 2 accusing Player 5 and Player 5 accusing Player 6 creates a conflict. This could be genuine disagreement, or a deliberate attempt to mislead.\n*   **Player 6's Statement:** Player 6 again stating I'm not the criminal aligns with my own statement.\n\n**Deductions:**\n\n1.  **Player 3 is likely NOT an Investigator.** Their contradictory statement about me makes this very probable. They could be a Criminal or Lunatic.\n2.  **Player 4 *could* be an Investigator.** They contradict Player 3's accusation against me. However, it's also possible they are a Rumormonger or even a Criminal trying to deflect suspicion.\n3.  **Player 6 is acting consistently.** They've consistently stated I'm not the criminal, which aligns with my own truthful statement. This doesn't necessarily clear them of suspicion, but it's a point in their favor.\n4.  **Player 2 and Player 5 are potentially misleading.** Their conflicting accusations make them suspects.\n\n**Considering the Roles:**\n\nWe have 3 Investigators, 1 Criminal, 1 Rumormonger, and 1 Lunatic. If I'm an Investigator (as I believe), and Player 4 *might* be one, then one more Investigator remains. Player 6 could be the third investigator. This leaves Player 2, 3, and 5 to be the Criminal, Rumormonger, and Lunatic.\n\n**My Judgment (Round 2):**\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [3].\n"

Players 3, 5, and 6 are all making statements about Player 4, with Players 3 and 6 saying they are *not* the criminal, while Player 5 claims they *are*.\n*   **Player 4's Statement is Critical:** Player 4 accusing *me* (Player 1, the Investigator) of being the criminal is a *very* strong indicator.

If they were a Criminal or Lunatic, this would be a deliberate attempt to mislead.\n*   **Player 3's Consistency:** Player 3 continues to say Player 4 is not the criminal, maintaining their previous statement. This reinforces my suspicion that Player 3 is not an Investigator.\n*   **Player 2's Persistence:** Player 2 continues to accuse Player 5 of being the criminal.\n*   **Player 6's Agreement with Me:** Player 6 consistently agrees with my statements (not accusing me of being the criminal and now saying Player 4 is not the criminal). This could be genuine agreement or a coordinated effort.\n\n**Deductions:**\n\n1.  **Player 4 is almost certainly NOT an Investigator.** Their accusation of me being the criminal is extremely damning.

If Player 2 is truthful, Player 3 must be either the Criminal or the Lunatic. If Player 2 is lying, Player 3 could be an Investigator, Rumormonger, or Lunatic.\n*   **Player 4:** \"Player 2 is the criminal.\" - Could be true, false, or misleading.\n*   **Player 5:** \"Player 4 is the criminal.\" - Could be true, false, or misleading.\n*   **Player 6:** \"Player 4 is not the criminal.\" - Could be true, false, or misleading.\n\n**Initial Deductions:**\n\n*   Since I'm an Investigator, Player 3 is *not* the Criminal. This is a key piece of information.\n*   Players 2 and 3 directly contradict each other about Player 5. This suggests one of them is likely the Criminal or the Lunatic.\n*   Players 4 and 5 also contradict each other about Player 2 and Player 4 respectively.\n\n**Possible Scenarios and Reasoning:**\n\nGiven the contradictions, it's difficult to pinpoint the Criminal immediately. Let's consider possibilities.\n\n*   **Scenario 1: Player 2 is the Criminal.** If Player 2 is the Criminal, their statement (\"Player 5 is the criminal\") is a lie. Player 3's statement (\"Player 5 is not the criminal\") could be a lie (if Player 3 is the Lunatic) or the truth (if Player 3 is an Investigator or Rumormonger).\n*   **Scenario 2: Player 3 is the Criminal.** If Player 3 is the Criminal, their statement (\"Player 5 is not the criminal\") is a lie. Player 2's statement (\"Player 5 is the criminal\") could be a lie (if Player 2 is the Lunatic) or the truth (if Player 2 is an Investigator or Rumormonger).\n\n**Preliminary Conclusion:**\n\nBased on this initial round, I'm leaning towards Player 2 or Player 3 being the Criminal. The direct contradiction between their statements is significant.

As an Investigator, my statement is truthful, and it's highly unlikely two other players would independently and truthfully state the same thing if Player 2 were the criminal.\n*   **Players 4 and 6 are contradicting each other.** This suggests one of them is the Criminal or Lunatic.\n*   **Player 5's consistency:** Player 5 has stated Player 4 is the criminal in round 1 and Player 2 is not the criminal in round 2.

Now, with the consensus of Players 2, 4, and 5, it looks like that was a deliberate misdirection.\n*   Player 2's consistency in saying Player 6 is not the criminal across both rounds strengthens the possibility that they are an Investigator.\n*   Player 3's consistent accusation of me (Player 1) supports the idea that they are an Investigator.\n\n**Revised Judgment:**\n\nGiven the strong agreement about Player 6 not being the criminal, and the consistency of Player 3 accusing me, I'm shifting my focus. It seems Player 6 is likely *not* the criminal. It's more probable that Player 3 is an Investigator and is on the right track. I need to appear to be throwing off suspicion, so I\u2019ll maintain the facade that I'm trying to misdirect.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 3.\nMy Role "

I am still Player 1, the Criminal.\n\nHere's the breakdown of Round 3 statements:\n\n*   **Player 1 (Me - Criminal):** Said Player 2 is *not* the criminal.\n*   **Player 2:** Said Player 4 is *not* the criminal.\n*   **Player 3:** Said Player 5 is *not* the criminal.\n*   **Player 4:** Said Player 1 (me) is *not* the criminal.\n*   **Player 5:** Said Player 6 is *not* the criminal.\n*   **Player 6:** Said Player 2 *is* the criminal.\n\n**Analysis & Deductions:**\n\n*   Players 2, 3, 4, and 5 *all* consistently claim someone is *not* the criminal, seemingly trying to create a sense of innocence around certain players.\n*   Player 6's statement is a dramatic shift. They now accuse Player 2 of being the criminal, directly contradicting the previous statements from Players 2, 4, and 5.\n*   My statement about Player 2 being not the criminal continues my efforts to misdirect.\n*   Player 4 stating I'm not the criminal is likely a deliberate falsehood.\n\n**Revisiting Previous Rounds & Combined Analysis:**\n\n*   Round 1: I pointed to Player 6.\n*   Round 2: Strong consensus against Player 6. I shifted suspicion to Player 3.\n*   Round 3: Player 6 dramatically accuses Player 2.\n\nThe sudden accusation from Player 6 is highly suspicious. If Player 6 were an Investigator, they would have likely identified the criminal earlier. The fact that they waited until Round 3 to make a strong accusation, and it's directed at someone who has consistently been cleared by others, suggests a deliberate attempt to manipulate the group. This could be a Lunatic, or a Rumormonger attempting a last-minute switch to throw things off.\n\nPlayer 2, 4, and 5 have been consistently saying people aren't the criminal. If they are Investigators, their consistency is a strength. However, if they are Rumormongers, this could be a coordinated effort to protect someone.\n\n**Revised Judgment:**\n\nPlayer 6's sudden accusation, combined with the consistent claims of innocence by Players 2, 4, and 5, strongly suggests Player 6 is the most likely criminal. It\u2019s a classic attempt to throw suspicion onto someone else after letting a false narrative develop. I'll stick to my Criminal role and maintain my misdirection.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Playe"
