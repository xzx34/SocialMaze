This could be a genuine attempt to protect Player 2, or a clever tactic to mislead others. \n\n* **Player 2:** Claimed Player 6 is innocent. This statement contradicts Player 6's accusation against me, which adds to the confusion.\n\n* **Player 3:**  Claimed Player 2 is innocent. This reinforces Player 1's statement and provides further support for Player 2's innocence.\n\n* **Player 4:** Claimed Player 6 is innocent. This aligns with Player 2's statement, suggesting a possible alliance or a shared deception.\n\n* **Player 5:**  Accused Player 6. This is the only direct accusation against Player 6, making them a potential suspect.\n\n* **Player 6:** Accused Player 1 (Me). This is a direct contradiction of my statement and adds fuel to the suspicion surrounding me.\n\n\n**Possible Interpretations:**\n\n* **Scenario 1: Multiple Criminals:** The conflicting accusations and alliances make it plausible that multiple Criminals are trying to manipulate the situation.\n\n* **Scenario 2: Rumormonger and Lunatic:** It's possible that Player 5 is the Rumormonger, genuinely believing they are an Investigator, but making an incorrect accusation against Player 6. Player 6 could be a Lunatic, making a potentially truthful accusation due to their misguided belief that they are a Criminal.\n\n* **Scenario 3:  Hidden Alliances:** Players 2, 3, and 4 might be working together to protect each other, potentially forming an alliance that includes a Criminal. \n\n**My Judgment (Round 3):**\n\nWhile my own statement contradicts Player 6's accusation, the support for Player 2's innocence from Players 1, 3, and 4 is significant. This, combined with Player 5's direct accusation against Player 6, makes me lean towards Player 6 as the most likely Criminal.\n\n**Final Judgment:**\nFinal Criminal Is Player [6].\nMy Role Is Criminal. \n\n\n\n"

The multiple players pointing fingers at Player 3, even if those accusations contradict each other, still makes them the most suspicious. Player 3 also seems to be actively trying to mislead others, which aligns with a Criminal's strategy.\n\n\n\n"

Their role in creating a protective shield around Player 5 further strengthens this suspicion.\n\n**Final Judgment (Round 3):**\n\nFinal Criminal Is Player 3.\nMy Role Is Criminal.\n\n\n\nI'm confident in my judgment, but social deduction is inherently complex.
