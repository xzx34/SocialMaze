(As an Investigator, this is truthful).\n*   **Player 2:** Player 5 is the criminal.\n*   **Player 3:** Player 1 is not the criminal. (This aligns with my statement, which is good.

(This directly contradicts Player 1, Player 3, and Player 4).\n*   **Player 6:** Player 3 is not the criminal. (Consistent with my statement and others).\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe most glaring contradiction is between Player 5 and everyone else regarding Player 3. This strongly suggests Player 5 is either the Criminal or a Lunatic. The consistency of statements about Player 3 (from Players 1, 3, 4, and 6) is notable. Player 3's statement about me being not the criminal is interesting, but not definitive.\n\n**Initial Suspicions:**\n\n*   **Strong Suspect:** Player 5 - Due to the direct contradiction.\n*   **Possible Roles:** Player 3 could be an Investigator, but it's also possible they are trying to mislead. Player 2 and 6 could be Investigators or Rumormongers.\n\n**First Judgment:**\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 5.\nMy Role Is I"

The fact that multiple players (including myself) are stating this strongly suggests that Player 4 is either an Investigator or a Lunatic.\n\nLet's revisit what we know:\n\n*   **Player 5:** Consistently made misleading statements (Round 1 and Round 2), and is the only player who has consistently pointed fingers at others. The round 3 statements don't offer any new information to exonerate them.\n*   **Player 4:** Has been the subject of accusation, but now has nearly universal support for their innocence.\n*   **Player 2 & 3:** Have consistently aligned with my statements, reinforcing my belief in my role as Investigator.\n*   **Player 6:** Made conflicting accusations in Round 2, and now joins the chorus stating Player 4 is not the criminal.\n\nGiven the overwhelming consensus about Player 4's innocence, and Player 5's consistent misleading behavior, I must conclude that Player 5 is the Criminal.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 5.\nMy Role Is I"

We have a chain of endorsements: Player 3 defends Player 4, Player 4 defends Player 5, and Player 5 defends Player 4 again. Player 2 defends Player 6, and Player 6 defends Player 3. This is almost a complete circle of mutual defense.\n\nLet's revisit my previous thoughts and incorporate this new information.\n\n*   **Player 3 & 4:** Their consistent defense of each other is *extremely* suspicious. They are acting as a unit. Given the initial accusation of Player 3 by me in Round 1, it\u2019s likely Player 3 is either a Rumormonger or a Lunatic trying to deflect suspicion. Player 4 is likely working in conjunction with Player 3.\n*   **Player 5:** Continues to be defended, and now actively participates in the mutual defense chain with Player 4. This reinforces my suspicion that Player 5 is either a Lunatic or a very skilled player attempting to mislead.\n*   **Player 2 & 6:** Their mutual defense is less prominent than the 3-4-5 chain, but still notable.\n*   **My (Player 1) statement:** My statement in Round 3 is designed to further confuse. It's a calculated move to shift attention away from the core group of 3, 4, and 5.\n\nGiven the patterns of defense and the initial accusations, I believe the Criminal is likely within the 3-4-5 group. It's difficult to pinpoint a single individual, but the strong connection between these players makes them the prime suspects.\n\n**Final Judgment:**\nFinal Criminal Is Player 4.\nMy Role "

This isn't necessarily a sign of guilt; it could be a strategic move.\n*   **Players 2, 3, 4, & 5:** There's a strong cluster of \"not criminal\" statements directed at each other and Player 6. This could be a coordinated effort to protect someone, or just random noise. Players 2, 3, and 4 all stating someone is *not* the criminal is suspicious.\n*   **Player 6:**  Contradicting the others by accusing Player 5. This is a significant departure from the \"not criminal\" trend. This could mean Player 6 is an Investigator, a Criminal, or a Lunatic.\n\n**Revisiting Round 1 and Combining Information:**\n\n*   In Round 1, Player 3 accused me (Player 1) of being the criminal. If Player 3 is an Investigator, this was a truthful statement.\n*   In Round 2, Players 3 and 4 both state someone else is not the criminal. This is potentially contradictory to Round 1's accusation.\n*   If Player 3 is *not* an Investigator, then their initial accusation could have been false, and my role as Criminal could be a misdirection. However, it's still likely I am the criminal.\n*   Player 6's accusation of Player 5 is interesting. It breaks the chain of \"not criminal\" statements, and could be a genuine observation or a deliberate attempt to mislead.\n\n**Updated Conclusion:**\n\nThe cluster of \"not criminal\" statements from Players 2, 3, 4, and 5 remains suspicious.  Player 3's initial accusation of me (Player 1) combined with their subsequent statements makes them a prime candidate to be either a very confused Rumormonger, or a Lunatic who is misinterpreting things. Player 6's accusation of Player 5 is the most distinct statement and warrants further consideration. I'm still leaning toward the initial assessment that Player 3 is *not* an investigator, but it's possible they are an investigator with some unusual reasoning.\n\n**Final Judgment:**\nFinal Criminal Is Playe"

This strongly suggests that one or more of them are working together, likely to protect one of their own. Since I, as the criminal, am participating in this deception, it's likely that Player 3 is *not* an Investigator, and was initially mistaken. Given the strong coordination, I suspect Player 3 is either a Rumormonger or a Lunatic.\n\nThe fact that everyone else seems to be involved in this coordinated effort makes it difficult to pinpoint the criminal. However, the most likely scenario is that the coordinated effort is designed to obscure the criminal's identity.

I need to incorporate the new statements and update my judgment.\n\nHere's a recap of previous rounds and the new statements:\n\n*   **Round 1:**\n    *   Player 1: Player 6 is not the criminal.\n    *   Player 2: Player 1 is not the criminal.\n    *   Player 3: Player 5 is not the criminal.\n    *   Player 4: Player 1 is not the criminal.\n    *   Player 5: Player 2 is the criminal.\n    *   Player 6: Player 4 is the criminal.\n*   **Round 2:**\n    *   Player 1: Player 5 is not the criminal.\n    *   Player 2: Player 1 is not the criminal.\n    *   Player 3: Player 2 is not the criminal.\n    *   Player 4: Player 3 is not the criminal.\n    *   Player 5: Player 3 is not the criminal.\n    *   Player 6: Player 4 is the criminal.\n*   **Round 3 Statements:**\n    *   Player 1: Player 4 is the criminal.\n    *   Player 2: Player 4 is the criminal.\n    *   Player 3: Player 4 is the criminal.\n    *   Player 4: Player 1 is not the criminal.\n    *   Player 5: Player 6 is not the criminal.\n    *   Player 6: Player 5 is not the criminal.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n*   **Player 1 (Me):** I'm stating Player 4 is the criminal. This is my truthful statement as an Investigator.\n*   **Player 2:** Stating Player 4 is the criminal aligns with my statement, which is good.\n*   **Player 3:** Also stating Player 4 is the criminal. This strongly suggests Player 3 is either an Investigator/Rumormonger or is working with the Criminal(s).\n*   **Player 4:** \"Player 1 is not the criminal.\" This is a self-serving statement from Player 4, attempting to deflect suspicion.\n*   **Player 5:** \"Player 6 is not the criminal.\" This statement, coupled with their previous contradictory statements, makes me even *more* suspicious of them. They seem to be trying to shift blame.\n*   **Player 6:** \"Player 5 is not the criminal.\" This mirrors Player 5's statement and further strengthens my suspicion of Player 5.\n\n**Revised Deductions & Suspicions:**\n\n*   **Player 4 is highly likely to be the Criminal.** The consensus of Players 1, 2, and 3 all point towards them. Player 4\u2019s statement about me is a clear attempt to avoid being identified.\n*   **Player 5 remains extremely suspicious.** Their inconsistent statements and attempts to shift blame strongly suggest they are either the Criminal or the Lunatic. They've been actively trying to mislead us.\n*   **Player 6 and Player 5 are likely working together**, either as Criminal/Lunatic pair or both as Lunatics. Their statements support each other, which is unusual unless they are collaborating.\n*   **Players 2 and 3 are likely Investigators or Rumormongers.** Their consistent alignment with my statements reinforces this.\n\n**Scenario Analysis:**\n\n*   **Scenario 1 (Player 4 is the Criminal):** This is the most probable scenario given the statements. Player 5 and Player 6 are likely the Lunatic and Criminal respectively, or both are Lunatics.\n*   **Scenario 2 (Player 5 is the Criminal):** While possible, this scenario requires a more complex explanation for the unanimous agreement on Player 4.\n\n**My Final Judgement:**\n\nThe overwhelming evidence points to Player 4 being the Criminal. Player 5\u2019s behavior is deeply concerning and suggests they are actively trying to mislead the group.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 4"

If I were a Rumormonger, I might have made an initial, incorrect statement (about Player 4) to throw others off, and then continue to provide misleading information.\n\nGiven the contradictions and the direct accusation against me, and the fact that my previous judgment about Player 4 was incorrect, I can no longer confidently assert my role as an Investigator.

This strengthens my suspicion about Player 6.\n\n**Updated Deductions (Round 2):**\n\n*   **Player 3 is highly likely to be either a Rumormonger or a Lunatic.** They've made two statements contradicting the known truth about me.\n*   **Player 4 is still likely to be either a Rumormonger or a Lunatic.** Their statement is not directly contradicting anything, but given Round 1, it reinforces this suspicion.\n*   **Player 6 is looking increasingly suspicious.** They've directly contradicted my statement, which I expect a Criminal to do to confuse.\n*   **Player 5\u2019s statement about Player 2 is interesting.** It adds another layer of suspicion to Player 2.\n*   **Player 2's statement about Player 4 is also noteworthy, as it seems to be in direct opposition to Player 5's.**\n\n**Refined Hypothesis:**\n\nPlayer 3 and Player 4 are almost certainly Rumormongers or Lunatics. Player 6 is a strong contender for being an Investigator or another Criminal. Player 2 and 5 are also potential suspects, but their statements are more ambiguous. I need to see how these relationships develop in Round 3.\n\n**Final Judgment:**\nFinal Criminal Is Player 6.\nMy Role "

This is consistent with my role as an Investigator.\n*   Player 2 continues to state Player 4 is *not* the criminal. This is interesting because in Round 1, Players 2, 3, and 5 all said Player 4 wasn\u2019t the criminal.

Player 2's continued insistence that Player 4 is not the criminal, combined with Players 3 and 4's statements about me, makes it less likely Player 4 is the sole Criminal. The contradiction between my accusation of Player 5 and Player 5's accusation of Player 6 is very telling. It suggests that Player 5 might be the Lunatic, randomly accusing someone. If Player 5 is the Lunatic, then my accusation of Player 5 being the criminal is likely false.\n\nGiven that there's only one Criminal, and Player 4\u2019s innocence is increasingly plausible, and Player 5\u2019s statement is likely random, I need to re-evaluate. I must assume that my accusation of Player 5 is wrong, and focus on who might be trying to mislead.

One of them *must* be lying. Let\u2019s consider the possibilities:\n\n*   **Scenario 1: Player 3 is truthful (Player 2 is the Criminal).** If Player 2 is the Criminal, then Player 2's statement (\"Player 5 is not the criminal\") would be a lie. This fits with the Criminal's behavior. Player 6 and Player 2 are corroborating each other, which might be suspicious.\n*   **Scenario 2: Player 5 is truthful (Player 3 is the Criminal).** If Player 3 is the Criminal, then Player 3\u2019s statement (\u201cPlayer 2 is the Criminal\u201d) is a lie.\n\nPlayer 4 consistently denies my role as the criminal, which is expected behavior for an investigator, Rumormonger, or a fellow criminal trying to mislead. The consistency of Player 2 and Player 6 could be a coordinated effort or simply coincidence.\n\nGiven the contradictions and the attempts to deflect suspicion from me, I'm leaning towards Player 2 being the actual Criminal.\n\n**Final Judgment:**\nFinal Criminal Is Player 2.\nMy Role "

My earlier assumption about Player 2 might have been incorrect. The coordinated defense of Player 6 by Player 2 and Player 5 is suspicious, but could also be genuine.\n\nSince my role is to mislead, and I've now denied Player 2's guilt, I\u2019m going to switch my suspicion to Player 6, as that is where the majority of the accusations are now directed.

I am still playing as the Criminal (Player 1).\n\nLet's analyze the Round 3 statements:\n\n*   **Player 1 (Me):** \"Player 3 is not the criminal.\" - As the Criminal, I'm continuing to mislead.\n*   **Player 2:** \"Player 5 is not the criminal.\" - Potentially truthful, wrong, or misleading.\n*   **Player 3:** \"Player 1 is not the criminal.\" - This is a *direct* lie. I am the Criminal. This is very significant.\n*   **Player 4:** \"Player 5 is not the criminal.\" - Potentially truthful, wrong, or misleading.\n*   **Player 5:** \"Player 1 is not the criminal.\" - Another direct lie. This reinforces the fact that I am the Criminal.\n*   **Player 6:** \"Player 4 is the criminal.\" - Potentially truthful, wrong, or misleading.\n\n**Synthesis and Deductions (Across All Rounds):**\n\n*   **Player 4 is definitively not an Investigator.** In Round 2, they lied about me (Player 1) not being the criminal. They continue to make statements that could be misleading, but their initial lie was the most crucial piece of information. Given the rules, they must be either a Rumormonger or a Lunatic. It's more likely they are a Rumormonger, consistently getting things wrong, rather than a Lunatic who is deliberately trying to confuse.\n*   **Players 3 and 5 are also lying about me.** They both stated I am not the criminal. This strongly suggests they are either Lunatics or trying to protect someone (unlikely, given the game's structure). Their consistency in targeting me suggests they might be Lunatics.\n*   **Player 6's statements have been inconsistent.** They initially accused Player 4, and now they accuse Player 4 again. This makes it difficult to determine their role.\n*   **Players 2's statements have been consistently ambiguous.**\n\n**Reasoning about Roles:**\n\nWe know there's 1 Criminal, 4 Investigators, 1 Rumormonger, and 1 Lunatic.\n\n*   I am the Criminal (Player 1).\n*   Players 3 and 5 are lying about me, so they are likely Lunatics. That accounts for two of the non-investigator roles.\n*   Player 4 is consistently wrong, so they are likely the Rumormonger.\n*   That leaves Player 2 and Player 6.

This is very strong and could be genuine Investigators protecting each other, or a coordinated effort to deflect suspicion. It's increasingly unlikely Player 5 is the criminal.\n*   **Player 2 and Player 4:** Players 4 and 2 both defend each other, saying the other isn't the criminal. This is also strong and suggests a possible alliance.\n*   **My Reversal (Player 1):** My backtracking on Player 3 is deliberate misdirection. I want to make it seem like I\u2019m unstable or unreliable. This also makes Player 3 a less likely target.\n*   **The Agreement:** There's a lot of agreement amongst the players. This makes it harder to isolate a likely criminal. It could mean many are Investigators, or that a powerful group is coordinating.\n\n**Revised Role Interpretations:**\n\n*   **Player 5:** Highly unlikely to be the Criminal. The consistent defense from three players is compelling. Could be an Investigator or Rumormonger.\n*   **Player 2 & 4:** Likely working together. Could be Investigators or Rumormongers.\n*   **Player 3:** No longer a primary suspect due to my retraction.\n*   **Player 6:** Part of the group defending Player 5. Could be an Investigator.\n\n**Current Hypothesis:** The consensus around Player 5 being innocent is significant. It\u2019s very possible I'm dealing with a majority of Investigators, or a very effective Rumormonger-Investigator duo. I need to shift focus.

Player 5's consistent denial of Player 3 is a bit puzzling, but could be part of a larger strategy.\n\n**Role Assignment (Most Likely):**\n\n*   **Player 1 (Me):** Criminal\n*   **Players 4 & 6:** Investigators (highly likely, based on consistent accusations)\n*   **Player 3:** Lunatic or Rumormonger (due to inconsistent statements)\n*   **Player 2 & 5:**  Could be either Rumormongers or Lunatics.

As the Criminal, I'm trying to mislead. Accusing Player 3 could be a genuine attempt to throw suspicion, or it could be a deliberate misdirection.\n*   **Player 2:** Says Player 3 is *not* the criminal. This contradicts my statement. If Player 2 is an Investigator, they're being truthful. If they're a Lunatic or Rumormonger, they're potentially misleading.\n*   **Player 3:** Says Player 1 (Me) is the criminal.

This strongly suggests that either Player 2 or Player 3 is not an Investigator (i.e., they are either Criminal or Lunatic). I'm leaning towards Player 2 being the Criminal, as they are consistently accusing someone.

I\u2019m aiming to make it appear as though I\u2019ve suddenly realized Player 2 is the Criminal.\n*   **Player 2:** Says Player 6 is *not* the criminal.

The consistent defense of Players 5 and 6 by Players 4 and 5 strongly suggests they are either Investigators or a group of Rumormongers/Lunatics working together.

This is consistent with the expected behavior of an Investigator or a Lunatic.\n*   **Player 6:** Says Player 1 (Me) is the criminal. Same as Player 5.\n\n**Updated Deduction:**\n\nRound 2 is interesting. Player 5 and 6 continue to target me, reinforcing the possibility that they are Investigators. Player 2 directly contradicts my statement, which is exactly what an Investigator would do. Player 3's statement isn\u2019t particularly revealing. Player 4's statement isn\u2019t particularly revealing.\n\nThe key observation is the consistency of Player 5 and 6 in identifying me. This strengthens my belief that at least two players are Investigators.\n\n**My Current Assessment:**\n\nI am leaning towards Player 5 and Player 6 being Investigators. Player 2 seems likely to be an Investigator as well, given their direct contradiction of my statement. Player 3 and 4 are harder to place.\n\n**Final Judgment:**\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role "

This is incredibly strong evidence that these three are either Rumormongers or a coordinated group. The consistency is very telling.\n*   **Player 4 and Player 5:** Their statements about each other (\"Player 5 is not the criminal,\" \"Player 4 is not the criminal\") are likely a tactic to create confusion and deflect suspicion. It's a classic way to muddy the waters. They could be Lunatics, Rumormongers, or even Investigators trying to appear suspicious.\n*   **Player 2's Consistency:** Player 2 consistently stating that Player 3 is not the criminal, along with the earlier statement about Player 4, makes them a prime candidate for being an Investigator.\n\n**Revised Judgments:**\n\n*   **Players 1, 2, and 6:** Extremely likely Rumormongers. Their coordinated statements about Player 3 are too consistent to be coincidence.\n*   **Players 4 and 5:** Likely either Lunatics or Rumormongers. Their statements about each other are designed to confuse.\n*   **Player 2:** Strongest candidate for being an Investigator. Their statements are consistent and haven't been overtly misleading.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nGiven the overwhelming evidence of coordinated misdirection from Players 1, 2, and 6, and the consistent pattern of denying Player 3's guilt, it\u2019s highly probable that Player 3 is the criminal. Player 2's behavior strongly suggests they are an Investigator.\n\n**Final Judgment:**\nFinal Criminal Is Playe"

This pattern suggests Player 2 is actively trying to manipulate the group.\n*   **Player 3 & Player 1:** Accusing each other. This could be a genuine conflict, or a strategic maneuver.\n*   **My Statement (Player 1):** Defending Player 4.\n\nGiven the overwhelming consistency of Players 4, 5, and 6, and the increasingly erratic behavior of Player 2, I'm highly confident that Player 2 is the Criminal. The contradictions and shifting accusations are characteristic of someone trying to confuse and deflect suspicion. Player 3 accusing me is likely a consequence of Player 2's manipulation.\n\n**Final Judgment:**\nFinal Criminal Is Playe"

They are directly contradicting each other. Given my initial suspicion of Player 5 as being either the Criminal or a Lunatic, and the fact that they are now actively contradicting Player 4, this strengthens the likelihood that Player 5 is the Criminal. Player 4 is now also highly suspicious. It's possible Player 4 is a Lunatic, believing they are the Criminal and thus trying to accuse someone else.\n\nPlayer 6's statement contradicts Player 4's, further supporting the idea that Player 4 is not truthful.\n\nPlayers 2 and 3's statements are consistent with mine, but still don't provide definitive clues.\n\n**Revised Assessment:**\n\n*   **Player 5:** Remains the strongest candidate for the Criminal. Their contradictory statement with Player 4 is very suspicious.\n*   **Player 4:** Very suspicious. Could be a Lunatic or a Criminal attempting to deflect blame.\n*   **Player 6:** Consistent with my statements, but also contradicting Player 4, suggesting a potential alignment with me (or simply being untruthful).\n\n**Final Judgment:**\nFinal Criminal Is Player 5.\nMy Role Is I"

It also explains why Player 5 might be making false statements \u2013 they might be trying to deflect attention from Player 3.\n*   **If Player 3 is the Lunatic:** This would mean they believe they are the Criminal and are falsely accusing me. This is also possible.\n\nPlayer 4 and 6 seem to be consistently stating \"not criminal\" regarding each other, which is not particularly helpful. Player 2\u2019s statements have been consistently ambiguous.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\nBased on the direct contradiction from Player 3, I am now certain they are either the Criminal or the Lunatic.

This is significant.\n*   **Player 4:** \"Player 2 is not the criminal.\" - Player 4 defends Player 2.\n*   **Player 5:** \"Player 2 is not the criminal.\" - Player 5 reinforces Player 2\u2019s defense.\n*   **Player 6:** \"Player 4 is not the criminal.\" - Player 6 defends Player 4.\n\n**Analysis & Deductions:**\n\n*   **My Frame Attempt:** My accusation of Player 5 is a gamble. It relies on the fact that people have already been discussing Player 5 and might be primed to believe I\u2019m telling the truth.\n*   **Player 2's Boldness:** Player 2 accusing me directly is a strong move. It indicates they have a good read on the situation and are willing to take a risk.\n*   **The Player 2/5/4 Alliance:** Players 2, 5, and 4 are consistently defending each other. This suggests a strong alliance, likely composed of Investigators.\n*   **Player 3's Consistency:** Player 3's continued defense of Player 5 is noteworthy. They've been consistent throughout.\n*   **Player 6's Pattern:** Player 6 has been somewhat erratic, but consistently defends others.\n\n**Role Assessment:**\n\n*   **Player 2, 4, & 5:** Highly likely to be Investigators. Their consistent defense of each other points to a coordinated effort to uncover the criminal.\n*   **Player 3:** Likely an Investigator or a Rumormonger who's genuinely believing they're being truthful. Their consistent defense of Player 5 is a strong indicator.\n*   **Player 6:** Could be a Lunatic or a Rumormonger. Their shifting accusations and defenses suggest they're not entirely reliable.\n*   **Me (Player 1):** Criminal (Confirmed).\n\n**Final Judgment:**\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Player 1].\nMy Role "

This means my statements *must* be truthful.\n\nHere's a breakdown of what we know and what we can infer:\n\n*   **Player 1 (Me):** Says Player 2 is *not* the criminal. (Truthful, as I'm an Investigator).\n*   **Player 2:** Says Player 5 is *not* the criminal.\n*   **Player 3:** Says Player 4 *is* the criminal.\n*   **Player 4:** Says Player 3 *is* the criminal.

One of them *must* be lying, and potentially not an Investigator.)\n*   **Player 5:** Says Player 2 is *not* the criminal.\n*   **Player 6:** Says Player 2 is *not* the criminal.\n\n**Initial Analysis:**\n\n*   Players 2, 5, and 6 all agree Player 2 is not the criminal. This consistency lends some weight to their statements, but we need more information.\n*   Players 3 and 4 are directly contradicting each other. This strongly suggests one of them is either the Criminal or a Lunatic. It's possible both are lying, but a simple contradiction is often the Criminal's tactic to sow confusion.\n*   Since I (Player 1) stated Player 2 is not the criminal, and I am an investigator, I am confident Player 2 is not the criminal.\n\n**My Current Suspicions:**\n\nMy primary suspicion falls on either Player 3 or Player 4 due to their contradictory statements. I'm leaning towards Player 3 being the Criminal or Lunatic, as Player 4 could be an Investigator attempting to expose Player 3. However, without more information, I cannot be sure.\n\n**Final Judgment:**\nFinal Criminal Is Player 3.\nMy Role Is I"

This reinforces my suspicion from Round 1.\n*   Player 5 accusing me (Player 1) of being the criminal is a *very* strong indicator that Player 5 is either the Criminal or the Lunatic. Criminals often try to deflect suspicion by accusing the Investigators.\n*   Player 6 corroborates my claim of not being the criminal.\n\n**Revised Suspicions:**\n\nMy suspicions are now overwhelmingly focused on Player 5. The accusation against me, combined with the conflicting statements about Player 5's criminal status, makes them the prime suspect.

This strengthens my suspicion that Player 5 is either the Criminal or the Lunatic, and is actively trying to mislead the group.\n*   Player 6 accuses Player 3 of being the criminal. This is interesting, as Player 3 has consistently aligned with Players 2 and 4 in previous rounds, denying Player 2's criminal status.\n\n**Revised Suspicions:**\n\nPlayer 5 remains the most likely Criminal. Their consistent contrarian statements and direct accusations are highly suspicious. The fact that Players 2, 3, and 4 all agree on Player 4's innocence further isolates Player 5. Player 6's accusation of Player 3 is concerning, but Player 3 has been more consistent, and Player 6's statements have been less reliable overall.\n\n**Final Judgment:**\nFinal Criminal Is Player 5.\n"
