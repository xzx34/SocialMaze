Player 4's accusation of Player 6, while surprising, seems more likely to be a calculated move to protect Player 5.  \n\n\n\n"

Their consistent attempts to deflect accusations, coupled with their initial accusation against Player 4, point towards a deliberate attempt to mislead.\n\n\nI believe Player 2 and Player 3 are likely Investigators based on their consistent statements and focus on identifying the Criminal.

If Player 4 is the Lunatic, their accusation could be either true or false.\n\n* **Player 2's Deflection:** Player 2, who I believe is the Criminal, avoids directly addressing Player 4's accusation. Instead, they choose to make a statement about Player 4 that does not directly contradict the accusation. This is a classic tactic used by the Criminal to deflect attention away from themselves.\n\n* **Consistency with Prior Rounds:** Player 2's behavior in Round 3 aligns with their actions in previous rounds. They have consistently avoided direct accusations and have instead focused on making statements that cast doubt on others.\n\n* **Limited Impact of Other Statements:** While other players make statements, they do not provide strong enough evidence to overturn my conviction about Player 2. \n\n\n\nI believe my deductions are sound and that Player 2 is the Criminal."

If they are a Criminal, their accusation might be a calculated attempt to mislead.\n* **Player 6 accusing Player 1:** This is a direct challenge to my role as an Investigator. It's possible Player 6 is a Lunatic making a random accusation, or they might have information I'm not aware of.\n\n**Shifting Perspectives:**\n\n*  The possibility of Player 2 being the Criminal has increased due to Player 3's accusation. \n*  Player 6's statement against me raises doubts about my own role. It's possible I'm being deliberately targeted, but it's also possible Player 6 is simply wrong.\n\n**Final Judgment (Round 2):**\n\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Unknown].\nMy Role Is Investigator (but I am highly suspicious of Player 6's accusation). \n\n\n\nI am still leaning towards Player 2 or 3 as potential Criminals, but Player 6's accusation has introduced a new element of uncertainty.\n\n\n\n"
