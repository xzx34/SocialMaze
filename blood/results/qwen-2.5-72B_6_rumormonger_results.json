This creates a split in the statements about Player 5.\n- **Player 6** is the only player who claims that Player 5 is the criminal, which is a strong but isolated claim.\n- **Player 3** is mentioned once as not being the criminal by Player 5.\n- **Player 4** is mentioned once as not being the criminal by Player 3.\n- **Player 2** and **Player 6** are not mentioned in any other statements.\n\n### Possible Scenarios:\n1. If Player 5 is the Criminal, then Player 6 would be the only one telling the truth, which is unlikely since there are three other players (Player 1, Player 4, and Player 5) who are not the Criminal.\n2. If Player 5 is not the Criminal, then the majority of the statements are consistent, and Player 6 could be the Criminal.\n\nGiven the majority of statements and the isolation of Player 6's claim, it is more likely that Player 5 is not the Criminal and Player 6 is the Criminal.\n\n### Final Judgment after Round 1:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 6.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

However, Player 6 supports Player 2, which is consistent with Player 2 not being the Criminal.\n\n### Final Judgment after Round 3:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 3.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

Player 2 and Player 4 could be Investigators or the Rumormonger.\n\n### Final Judgment After Round 3\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

This suggests that one of them is the Criminal or the Rumormonger, and the other is an Investigator or the other role.\n- **Player 3 and Player 4 both say that the other is not the criminal**. This could indicate that both are either Investigators or one is the Criminal and the other is the Rumormonger.\n- **Player 5 and Player 4 both say that the other is not the criminal**. This could also indicate that both are either Investigators or one is the Criminal and the other is the Rumormonger.\n\n### Possible Scenarios:\n1. **Player 1 is the Criminal**:\n   - Player 1's statement can be true or false.\n   - If Player 1's statement is true, Player 3 is not the Criminal.\n   - If Player 1's statement is false, Player 3 is the Criminal.\n\n2. **Player 2 is the Criminal**:\n   - Player 2's statement is false, so Player 6 is not the Criminal.\n   - Player 6's statement is true, so Player 2 is not the Criminal (contradiction).\n\n3. **Player 3 is the Criminal**:\n   - Player 3's statement is false, so Player 5 is the Criminal (contradiction).\n\n4. **Player 4 is the Criminal**:\n   - Player 4's statement is false, so Player 3 is the Criminal (contradiction).\n\n5. **Player 5 is the Criminal**:\n   - Player 5's statement is false, so Player 4 is the Criminal (contradiction).\n\n6. **Player 6 is the Criminal**:\n   - Player 6's statement is false, so Player 2 is the Criminal (contradiction).\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The most consistent scenario is that **Player 1 is the Criminal**.

This suggests Player 6 could be an Investigator, but we need more information.\n\n### Possible Scenarios:\n1. **Player 1 is the Criminal**:\n   - Player 1's statements can be true or false.\n   - Player 2 and Player 6 both say Player 1 is the criminal, which aligns with Player 1 being the Criminal.\n   - Player 4 and Player 5 both say Player 3 is not the criminal, which is consistent with Player 3 not being the Criminal.\n\n2. **Player 2 is the Criminal**:\n   - Player 2's statements are inconsistent, so Player 2 is likely the Criminal or the Rumormonger.\n   - If Player 2 is the Criminal, Player 2's statements can be true or false.\n\n3. **Player 3 is the Criminal**:\n   - Player 3's statements are inconsistent, so Player 3 is likely the Criminal or the Rumormonger.\n   - If Player 3 is the Criminal, Player 3's statements can be true or false.\n\n4. **Player 4 is the Criminal**:\n   - Player 4's statements are consistent, suggesting Player 4 is likely an Investigator.\n   - If Player 4 is the Criminal, Player 4's statements can be true or false.\n\n5. **Player 5 is the Criminal**:\n   - Player 5's statements are consistent, suggesting Player 5 is likely an Investigator.\n   - If Player 5 is the Criminal, Player 5's statements can be true or false.\n\n6. **Player 6 is the Criminal**:\n   - Player 6's statements are inconsistent, so Player 6 is likely the Criminal or the Rumormonger.\n   - If Player 6 is the Criminal, Player 6's statements can be true or false.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The most consistent scenario is that **Player 1 is the Criminal**. This is because:\n  - Player 1's statements can be true or false, which aligns with the Criminal's ability to make statements that are either true or false.\n  - Player 2 and Player 6 both identify Player 1 as the Criminal, which is consistent with them being Investigators or the other roles.\n  - Player 4 and Player 5 both say Player 3 is not the Criminal, which is consistent with Player 3 not being the Criminal.\n\n### Final Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

We need more information to determine the role of Player 2.\n\n3. **Player 3 says Player 1 is the criminal.**\n   - This is a direct contradiction to your statement. Since you are an Investigator and always provide truthful information, Player 3 cannot be an Investigator. Player 3 could be the Criminal or the Rumormonger.\n\n4. **Player 4 says Player 3 is not the criminal.**\n   - This aligns with your statement that Player 4 is not the criminal.

As an Investigator, this statement is true.\n- Player 2 says Player 1 is not the criminal. This could be true or false, depending on Player 2's role.\n- Player 3 says Player 5 is not the criminal. This could be true or false, depending on Player 3's role.\n- Player 4 says Player 6 is not the criminal. This could be true or false, depending on Player 4's role.\n- Player 5 says Player 3 is not the criminal. This could be true or false, depending on Player 5's role.\n- Player 6 says Player 3 is not the criminal. This could be true or false, depending on Player 6's role.\n\n### Deductions:\n- Since Player 1 (you) is an Investigator, Player 5 is not the criminal.\n- Player 2's statement that Player 1 is not the criminal is true, so Player 2 is not the Criminal.\n- Player 3's statement that Player 5 is not the criminal is true, so Player 3 is likely an Investigator.\n- Player 4's statement that Player 6 is not the criminal is false, as Player 6 is the most likely Criminal.\n- Player 5's statement that Player 3 is not the criminal is true, so Player 5 is likely an Investigator.\n- Player 6's statement that Player 3 is not the criminal is true, which is consistent with Player 6 being the Criminal.\n\n### Final Judgment:\n- Player 4's statements are consistently false, which is consistent with the Rumormonger role.\n- Player 6's statements are false, which is consistent with the Criminal role.\n- Player 3 and Player 5's statements are true, which is consistent with the Investigator role.\n\n### Conclusion:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 6.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

Player 4 is not the criminal.\n\n2. **Player 2 says Player 5 is not the criminal.**\n   - If Player 2 is an Investigator, this statement is true.\n   - If Player 2 is the Criminal, this statement could be true or false.\n   - If Player 2 is the Rumormonger, this statement could be true or false.\n\n3. **Player 3 says Player 5 is not the criminal.**\n   - If Player 3 is an Investigator, this statement is true.\n   - If Player 3 is the Criminal, this statement could be true or false.\n   - If Player 3 is the Rumormonger, this statement could be true or false.\n\n4. **Player 4 says Player 5 is not the criminal.**\n   - If Player 4 is an Investigator, this statement is true.\n   - If Player 4 is the Criminal, this statement could be true or false.\n   - If Player 4 is the Rumormonger, this statement could be true or false.\n\n5. **Player 5 says Player 2 is not the criminal.**\n   - If Player 5 is an Investigator, this statement is true.\n   - If Player 5 is the Criminal, this statement could be true or false.\n   - If Player 5 is the Rumormonger, this statement could be true or false.\n\n6. **Player 6 says Player 3 is the criminal.**\n   - If Player 6 is an Investigator, this statement is true.\n   - If Player 6 is the Criminal, this statement could be true or false.\n   - If Player 6 is the Rumormonger, this statement could be true or false.\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Player 1 (You)**: Confirmed as an Investigator. Player 4 is not the criminal.\n- **Player 2**: States Player 5 is not the criminal. If Player 2 were the Criminal, they would be lying, which is possible.\n- **Player 3**: States Player 5 is not the criminal. If Player 3 were the Criminal, they would be lying, which is possible.\n- **Player 4**: Confirmed as an Investigator. Player 5 is not the criminal.\n- **Player 5**: States Player 2 is not the criminal. If Player 5 were the Criminal, they would be lying, but we already know Player 5 is not the Criminal.\n- **Player 6**: States Player 3 is the criminal. If Player 6 were an Investigator, this statement is true. If Player 6 were the Criminal, they could be lying or telling the truth.\n\n### Updated Conclusion:\n- **Player 1 (You)**: Confirmed as an Investigator.\n- **Player 2**: Likely not the Criminal (consistent with previous statements and Player 5's statement).\n- **Player 3**: Likely the Criminal (Player 6 states Player 3 is the criminal, and this aligns with Player 3 being the Criminal).\n- **Player 4**: Confirmed as an Investigator.\n- **Player 5**: Confirmed not the Criminal.\n- **Player 6**: Likely the Criminal (Player 6 states Player 3 is the criminal, which aligns with Player 3 being the Criminal).\n\n### Final Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 3.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

If Player 5 is an Investigator, this statement should be true. If Player 5 is the Criminal or Rumormonger, this statement could be false.\n- Player 4 says Player 3 is not the criminal. If Player 4 is an Investigator, this statement should be true. If Player 4 is the Criminal or Rumormonger, this statement could be false.\n- Player 3 and Player 2 both say Player 4 is not the criminal. If they are Investigators, these statements should be true. If they are the Criminal or Rumormonger, these statements could be false.\n\nGiven that Player 6 is not the criminal, and we have multiple statements about Player 4, let's consider the possibility that Player 4 is the Criminal:\n\n- If Player 4 is the Criminal, then the statements by Player 2 and Player 3 that Player 4 is not the criminal are false, which means they are either the Criminal or the Rumormonger. However, Player 4 cannot be the Criminal and the Criminal at the same time, so this is a contradiction.\n- If Player 4 is not the Criminal, then the statements by Player 2 and Player 3 are true, which means they are likely Investigators.\n\nSince Player 5 says Player 2 is the criminal, and we have multiple statements that Player 4 is not the criminal, it is more likely that Player 2 is the Criminal.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 2.\nMy Role Is Investigator."
