However, given the consistency of the statements and the fact that Player 2 has not been ruled out as the Criminal, it is reasonable to conclude that Player 2 is the Criminal.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [2].\nMy Role Is [Investigator]."

Since there are 4 Investigators and they always tell the truth, it is highly likely that at least one of these players is an Investigator. Therefore, Player 2 is likely not the criminal.\n\n- **Player 3 is not the criminal:**\n  - Statements from Players 2, 4, and 3's own statement in Round 2 all claim Player 3 is not the criminal. This is consistent and suggests that Player 3 is likely not the criminal.\n\n- **Player 4 is not the criminal:**\n  - Statements from Players 1 (you) in Round 1 and 4's own statement in Round 2 all claim Player 4 is not the criminal. This is consistent and suggests that Player 4 is likely not the criminal.\n\n- **Player 5 is not the criminal:**\n  - Statements from Players 3 and 5's own statement in Round 3 all claim Player 5 is not the criminal. However, Player 1 (you) claims Player 5 is the criminal. Given that Player 1 is told they are the Criminal, this statement can be false. Therefore, Player 5 is likely not the criminal.\n\n- **Player 6 is not the criminal:**\n  - Statements from Players 4 and 6's own statement in Round 2 all claim Player 6 is not the criminal. This is consistent and suggests that Player 6 is likely not the criminal.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- **Final Criminal Is Player 1.**\n- **My Role Is Criminal.**\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

Player 2 could be the Criminal and lying, or they could be a Rumormonger providing a true statement.\n\n3. **Player 3 says Player 5 is not the criminal.**\n   - This statement is true, as Player 5 is not the Criminal. Therefore, Player 3 is either an Investigator or a Rumormonger.\n\n4. **Player 4 says Player 6 is not the criminal.**\n   - This statement is true, as Player 6 is not the Criminal. Therefore, Player 4 is either an Investigator or a Rumormonger.\n\n5. **Player 5 says Player 1 is not the criminal.**\n   - This statement is true, as you are not the Criminal. Therefore, Player 5 is either an Investigator or a Rumormonger.\n\n6. **Player 6 says Player 4 is not the criminal.**\n   - This statement is true, as Player 4 is not the Criminal. Therefore, Player 6 is either an Investigator or a Rumormonger.\n\n### Summary of Round 3:\n- Player 1 (You) has consistently provided true statements, confirming your role as an Investigator.\n- Player 2 is the only player who has consistently provided statements that are either false or suspect, making them the most likely Criminal.\n- Players 3, 4, 5, and 6 have all made true statements, so they are either Investigators or Rumormongers.\n\n### Final Judgment after Round 3:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 2.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

The majority in Round 1 suggests Player 3 is not the criminal.\n\n#### Player 4:\n- **Round 1:** Not the criminal (Players 1, 2, 3)\n- **Round 2:** Criminal (Player 1)\n- **Round 3:** Not the criminal (Players 2, 3, 4, 6)\n- **Conclusion:** The majority in Round 3 suggests Player 4 is not the criminal. This aligns with the majority in Round 1.\n\n#### Player 6:\n- **Round 1:** Not the criminal (Players 5, 4)\n- **Round 2:** Not the criminal (Players 4, 5)\n- **Round 3:** Not the criminal (Players 5, 4, 6)\n- **Conclusion:** Multiple players in all rounds suggest Player 6 is not the criminal. This is a strong indication.\n\n### Final Deductions\n\n- **Player 1 (You) as the Criminal:**\n  - Two players (2 and 6) in Round 2 claim Player 1 is the criminal. If they are both Investigators, this is strong evidence.\n  - You are told you are the Criminal, and you can lie or tell the truth.\n\n- **Player 4 as the Criminal:**\n  - Only you claim Player 4 is the criminal, and multiple players in Round 3 suggest Player 4 is not the criminal.\n\n- **Player 3 as the Criminal:**\n  - Only you claim Player 3 is the criminal, and the majority in Round 1 suggests Player 3 is not the criminal.\n\n- **Player 6 as the Criminal:**\n  - Multiple players in all rounds suggest Player 6 is not the criminal.\n\n### Conclusion for Round 3\n\nGiven the statements, the most consistent and strong evidence points to Player 1 (you) being the Criminal. The statements from Players 2 and 6 in Round 2, combined with the role information you were given, suggest that you are indeed the Criminal.\n\n### Final Judgment for Round 3\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

Player 3 is claimed to be not the Criminal by Player 2 and Player 6, and Player 5 is claimed to be not the Criminal by Player 3 and Player 4. Player 5 is also claimed to be the Criminal by Player 5.\n\nGiven the information, let's consider the roles:\n- If Player 3 is the Criminal, then Player 2 and Player 6 are either Investigators or Rumormongers (since they are both saying Player 3 is not the Criminal).\n- If Player 5 is the Criminal, then Player 3 and Player 4 are either Investigators or Rumormongers (since they are both saying Player 5 is not the Criminal).\n\nSince I am the Criminal, I need to consider the most likely scenario:\n- If Player 5 is the Criminal (which is not possible since I am the Criminal), then Player 3 and Player 4 are Investigators.\n- If Player 3 is not the Criminal (as stated by multiple players), then Player 5's statement is likely false, and Player 5 could be the Rumormonger or another role.\n\nGiven the current information, the most likely scenario is:\n- Player 3 is not the Criminal.\n- Player 5 is not the Criminal.\n- Player 2 and Player 6 are likely Investigators or Rumormongers.\n\nSo, the most likely Criminal is Player 1 (me), and the most likely roles for the others are:\n- Player 2 and Player 6 are likely Investigators or Rumormongers.\n- Player 3 and Player 4 are likely Investigators or Rumormongers.\n- Player 5 is likely the Rumormonger or another role.\n\nFinal Judgment after Round 1:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

If Player 3 is the Criminal, they might be trying to mislead.\n- **Player 4's statement** that Player 6 is not the criminal aligns with previous statements from Players 3, 4, 5, and 6 in Round 1, further supporting that Player 6 is not the Criminal.\n- **Player 5's statement** that Player 4 is not the criminal aligns with previous statements from Players 2, 3, 5, and 6, further supporting that Player 4 is not the Criminal.\n- **Player 6's statement** that Player 3 is not the criminal aligns with Player 2's statement, further supporting that Player 3 is not the Criminal.\n\n### Conclusion for Round 3\n\n- **Player 2** and **Player 5** are likely Investigators because their statements consistently align with the idea that Player 4 and Player 3 are not the Criminals.\n- **Player 3** is likely not the Criminal based on the statements from Players 2 and 6.\n- **Player 4** is likely not the Criminal based on the multiple statements from Players 2, 3, 5, and 6.\n- **Player 6** is likely not the Criminal based on the multiple statements from Players 4 and 6.\n\nGiven the consistent statements from Players 2 and 5, and the fact that your statements (as the Criminal) are designed to mislead, the most likely conclusion is that you (Player 1) are the Criminal.\n\n### Final Judgment for Round 3\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

However, since you are an Investigator, your statements should be consistent. This suggests that the statement \"Player 3 is the criminal\" in Round 3 must be re-evaluated in light of the previous rounds.\n\n- Player 2, Player 5, and Player 6 consistently say Player 3 is not the criminal, which aligns with your statement in Round 2.

Given that you are an Investigator, your statements should be consistent, and the most likely explanation is that your statement in Round 3 is incorrect due to the nature of the game mechanics (e.g., a mistake in the game setup).\n\n- Since Player 2, Player 5, and Player 6 consistently say Player 3 is not the criminal, and you initially stated Player 3 is not the criminal in Round 2, it is more consistent to believe that Player 3 is not the criminal.\n\n- Player 3 and Player 4 both say Player 6 is not the criminal, which suggests that Player 6 is the Criminal, and one of them is likely the Rumormonger.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- Player 6 is the most likely candidate for the Criminal because multiple players (including you in Round 2) have stated that Player 3 is not the criminal, and Player 3 and Player 4 are providing conflicting information about Player 6.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 6.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

If Player 3 is the Rumormonger, their statements could be false.\n\n- **Player 1 (You):**\n  - Round 1: You say Player 4 is not the criminal.\n  - Round 2: You say Player 4 is the criminal.\n  - Round 2: Player 5 says Player 1 is the criminal.\n\n  - Your statements are contradictory, which is consistent with you being the Criminal.\n\n### Final Deductions:\n- **Player 5 is the most consistent target for the Criminal.**\n  - Multiple statements from other players suggest Player 5 is the Criminal.\n  - Player 3's conflicting statements add to the suspicion that Player 5 is the Criminal, and Player 3 is likely the Rumormonger.\n  - Player 5's statement that Player 1 is the Criminal is likely a lie, consistent with Player 5 being the Criminal.\n\n### Final Judgment for Round 2:\n- **Final Criminal Is Player 5.**\n- **My Role Is Criminal.**\n\n### Reasoning:\n- The consistent statements from multiple players (Player 2 and Player 3) that Player 5 is not the criminal, combined with Player 5's statement that Player 1 is the criminal, strongly suggest that Player 5 is the Criminal.\n- Your contradictory statements are consistent with you being the Criminal, as you can lie or tell the truth."

Player 4 is confirmed as the criminal.\n\n5. **Player 5 says Player 1 is not the criminal.**\n   - Since Player 1 is not the criminal, this statement is true. Player 5 is the Rumormonger, as they provided a true statement but are not an Investigator.\n\n6. **Player 6 says Player 4 is not the criminal.**\n   - Since Player 4 is the criminal, this statement is false. Player 6 could be the Criminal or the Rumormonger. However, since Player 4 is already identified as the criminal, Player 6 must be the Rumormonger.\n\n### Re-evaluation and Final Deductions:\n- Player 4 is the criminal, as confirmed by your statement and the false statements from Player 2 and Player 6.\n- Player 5 is the Rumormonger, as they provided a true statement but are not an Investigator.\n- Player 3's statement is true, suggesting they might be an Investigator or a Rumormonger who happens to be correct.\n- Player 2's statement is false, confirming they are not the Criminal (since Player 4 is the Criminal). Therefore, Player 2 must be an Investigator or a Rumormonger.\n\n### Final Judgment After Round 3:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 4.\nMy Role Is Investigator.\n\n### Explanation:\n- You have consistently identified Player 4 as the criminal based on your truthful statements.\n- Player 5 is the Rumormonger because they provided a true statement but are not an Investigator.\n- Player 6 is the Rumormonger because they provided a false statement.\n- Player 2 and Player 3's roles are still inconclusive, but they are likely Investigators based on their statements aligning with the truth. However, the primary focus is on identifying the criminal and your role, which are now clear."

Therefore, Player 6 is likely the Rumormonger or the Criminal.\n\n### Possible Scenarios:\n\n1. **If Player 1 (You) is the Criminal:**\n   - This is consistent with the statements made by Player 2 and Player 6, who both accuse you of being the Criminal.\n   - Player 3, Player 4, and Player 5 are likely Investigators.\n\n2. **If Player 6 is the Criminal:**\n   - This would mean Player 6 is lying, which is consistent with being the Criminal.\n   - Player 1 (You) would be lying, which is consistent with being the Criminal.\n   - Player 2 and Player 6 are inconsistent, suggesting Player 2 is the Rumormonger.\n\n### Conclusion for Round 3:\n\nGiven the statements, the most likely scenario is that Player 1 (You) is the Criminal. The accusations from Player 2 and Player 6 are consistent with this. Player 3, Player 4, and Player 5 are likely Investigators, and Player 2 is likely the Rumormonger.\n\n### Final Judgment for Round 3:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

Consistently states that Player 2 is not the criminal, which could be a lie or the truth.\n\n- **Player 2:**\n  - In Round 1, states Player 6 is not the criminal.\n  - In Round 2, states Player 1 is the criminal.\n  - If Player 2 is an Investigator, their Round 2 statement is false, which means Player 1 is not the criminal.\n  - If Player 2 is the Criminal, their statements could be true or false.\n\n- **Player 3:**\n  - In Round 1, states Player 4 is not the criminal.\n  - In Round 2, states Player 1 is the criminal.\n  - If Player 3 is an Investigator, their Round 2 statement is false, which means Player 1 is not the criminal.\n  - If Player 3 is the Criminal, their statements could be true or false.\n\n- **Player 4:**\n  - In Round 1, states Player 5 is not the criminal.\n  - In Round 2, states Player 2 is not the criminal.\n  - If Player 4 is an Investigator, both statements are true.\n  - If Player 4 is the Criminal, their statements could be true or false.\n\n- **Player 5:**\n  - In Round 1, states Player 4 is not the criminal.\n  - In Round 2, states Player 3 is not the criminal.\n  - If Player 5 is an Investigator, both statements are true.\n  - If Player 5 is the Criminal, their statements could be true or false.\n\n- **Player 6:**\n  - In Round 1, states Player 3 is the criminal.\n  - In Round 2, states Player 1 is not the criminal.\n  - If Player 6 is an Investigator, their Round 2 statement is true, which means Player 1 is not the criminal.\n  - If Player 6 is the Criminal, their statements could be true or false.\n\n### Hypotheses:\n1. **Player 1 (You) is the Criminal:**\n   - This aligns with the fact that you are told you are the Criminal.\n   - Player 2 and Player 3 both accuse you of being the Criminal in Round 2.\n   - Player 6 states you are not the Criminal in Round 2, which could be a lie if Player 6 is the Criminal.\n\n2. **Player 6 is the Criminal:**\n   - Player 6's statements are inconsistent, which could indicate they are the Criminal.\n   - If Player 6 is the Criminal, their statements in Round 2 could be a lie, and Player 1 is not the Criminal.\n\n3. **Player 3 is the Criminal:**\n   - Player 3 accuses you of being the Criminal in Round 2, which could be a lie if Player 3 is the Criminal.\n   - Player 6 accuses Player 3 of being the Criminal in Round 1, which could be true if Player 6 is an Investigator.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the information from both rounds, the most consistent hypothesis is that Player 1 (You) is the Criminal. Player 2 and Player 3 both accuse you of being the Criminal, and Player 6's statements are inconsistent, which could indicate they are the Criminal. However, the most direct and consistent evidence points to you being the Criminal.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

This conflicts with my statement from Round 1.\n- **Player 3:** Claims Player 5 is not the criminal. This conflicts with my statement from Round 1.\n- **Player 4:** Claims Player 2 is the criminal. This aligns with my statement from Round 2.\n- **Player 5:** Claims Player 6 is not the criminal. This aligns with my statement from Round 1.\n- **Player 6:** Claims Player 5 is not the criminal. This aligns with Player 3's statement from Round 2.\n\n### Possible Roles:\n- **Player 1:** Investigator (confirmed by my role).\n- **Player 2:** Could be Criminal or Rumormonger (conflicts with my statement from Round 1 and Round 2).\n- **Player 3:** Could be Rumormonger (conflicts with my statement from Round 1).\n- **Player 4:** Likely Investigator (aligns with my statement from Round 2).\n- **Player 5:** Could be Rumormonger (conflicts with my statement from Round 1 but aligns with my statement from Round 2).\n- **Player 6:** Could be Rumormonger (conflicts with my statement from Round 1).\n\n### Conclusion:\n- Since I am an Investigator and I have identified Player 2 as the criminal in Round 2, Player 2 is likely the Criminal.\n- Player 3, Player 5, and Player 6 are the only ones who conflict with my statements, so one of them could be the Rumormonger.\n- Player 4 is likely an Investigator based on their alignment with my statement.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 2.\nMy Role Is Investigator."
