This direct accusation needs careful consideration, especially since Player 4 has previously made statements that could be consistent with an Investigator's role.\n5. **Player 5's Statement**: Says I (Player 1) am not the criminal, reinforcing the consensus around my role.\n6. **Player 6's Statement**: Says Player 5 is not the criminal, aligning with my statement in Round 3 and potentially indicating they are an Investigator or at least believe Player 5 is not the criminal.\n\nKey observations across all rounds:\n\n- There has been a consistent pattern of statements suggesting I (Player 1) am not the criminal, which aligns with my known role as an Investigator.\n- Player 2 accused Player 3 of being the criminal in Round 2, but in Round 3, Player 3 defended Player 2, saying they are not the criminal. This could indicate a strategic alliance or genuine belief, but it's also possible that one of them is the Criminal trying to deflect suspicion.\n- Player 4's accusation of Player 3 in Round 3 introduces a new dynamic, especially since it directly contradicts the defensive statement made by Player 3 about Player 2.\n\nConsidering all statements, it seems that the game's dynamics have led to a complex web of accusations and defenses. However, given my role as an Investigator and the need to make a final judgment based on the information provided:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 2.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

If Player 3 is indeed the criminal, this could be a deflection tactic.\n\n4. **Player 4 says Player 2 is the criminal.** Player 4 joins in accusing Player 2, which could indicate either a truthful identification of the criminal by an Investigator or a coordinated attempt to mislead if Player 4 is not an Investigator.\n\n5. **Player 5 says Player 2 is the criminal.** Another player accusing Player 2, adding to the consensus that Player 2 might be the criminal. However, this could also be a result of misinformation or a deliberate attempt to frame Player 2.\n\n6. **Player 6 says Player 1 is not the criminal.** This statement supports my claim of being an Investigator, as it would be expected for another Investigator or even a truthful statement from another role to acknowledge my innocence.\n\nConsidering the accumulation of accusations against Player 2 from multiple sources, including Players 3, 4, and 5, it seems plausible that Player 2 could indeed be the criminal, especially given the diversity of these accusations which might indicate a truthfulness that transcends potential deceit from a single source. However, my own statements and the initial analysis pointed towards Player 3 as a potential criminal, creating a conflict in interpretation.\n\nGiven the rules and the statements provided, and considering my role as an Investigator and the need to reconcile the information:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 2.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

However, it's crucial to remember that as the Criminal, my primary goal is to deceive, and the statements provided by other players could be influenced by their roles (Investigator, Rumormonger, or potentially Lunatic, though there are 0 Lunatics in this game).\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

However, like with Player 2, it's too early to confirm.\n5. **Player 5 says Player 4 is not the criminal.** Similar to Player 2's statement, this could indicate Player 5 is an Investigator, but it needs further verification.\n6. **Player 6 says Player 3 is the criminal.** This is a direct accusation.

However, considering Player 6 has accused me of being the criminal in both rounds, which I know to be false, Player 6's behavior is suspicious.\n\n4. **Player 4 says Player 3 is not the criminal.** If Player 4 is indeed the criminal, as I previously suspected, this statement could be an attempt to deflect attention from themselves or genuinely inform, depending on their strategy.\n\n5. **Player 5 says Player 2 is not the criminal.** Similar to other defensive statements, this provides some level of assurance about Player 2's role but doesn't conclusively determine it.\n\n6. **Player 6 says Player 1 is the criminal.** For the second time, Player 6 accuses me, which I know is false. This consistent attempt to frame me suggests that Player 6 might be the actual Criminal, as they are making a false accusation to mislead others.\n\nConsidering the statements from both rounds, the consistent false accusations from Player 6 against me, combined with the lack of direct contradictions to my initial claim about Player 4 from other players (except from Player 4 themselves, which could be self-serving), still points towards Player 4 as a potential criminal based on Round 1's analysis. However, Player 6's behavior in both rounds is highly suspicious and could indicate they are the Criminal, given their consistent false accusations against me.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 6.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

Given Player 6's behavior and the lack of any statement that directly and convincingly refutes my analysis of them, I lean towards the conclusion that they are the Criminal, based on their consistent false accusations against me, which is a tactic not expected from an Investigator or a truthful player.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 6.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

As an Investigator, I am truthful, so Player 2 is indeed not the criminal.\n2. **Player 2** says Player 5 is not the criminal. Since I've already established that Player 2 is not the criminal (from my statement), and assuming Player 2 could be an Investigator (since their statement aligns with what an Investigator would say), this statement supports the idea that Player 5 is not the criminal, but we cannot confirm Player 2's role yet.\n3. **Player 3** says Player 5 is not the criminal. This statement could be from an Investigator, Rumormonger, or even the Criminal trying to mislead. Without more information, we cannot determine Player 3's role.\n4. **Player 4** says Player 3 is not the criminal. Similar to Player 3's statement, this could be truthful or not, depending on Player 4's role.\n5. **Player 5** says Player 3 is not the criminal. Again, this statement's truthfulness depends on Player 5's role.\n6. **Player 6** says Player 3 is not the criminal. This adds to the consensus that Player 3 is likely not the criminal, but since multiple roles can make false statements, we must be cautious.\n\nGiven that all players except Player 3 and Player 5 have been cleared by at least one statement, and considering the roles and their possible statements, it's challenging to pinpoint the criminal after just one round. However, since I am told I am an Investigator and I stated that Player 2 is not the criminal, we can start building from there.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- We cannot conclusively determine the criminal's identity after Round 1.\n- Player 3 is the most frequently cleared player, which could indicate they are not the criminal, but it's also possible this is a result of the Criminal and/or Rumormonger's strategy to distract.\n\n**Final Judgment**:\nGiven the information, it's too early to accurately identify the criminal.

This aligns with my statement and could indicate Player 2 is also an Investigator, but we cannot confirm their role yet.\n3. **Player 3** says Player 6 is not the criminal. If Player 3 were the Criminal, they might say this to mislead, but since I've already stated Player 3 is not the criminal (and I'm an Investigator), this statement could be true or false depending on Player 3's actual role.\n4. **Player 4** says Player 6 is not the criminal. Similar to Player 3's statement, this could be truthful or not, depending on Player 4's role.\n5. **Player 5** says Player 3 is not the criminal. This statement supports the consensus that Player 3 is not the criminal, which aligns with what I and Player 2 have said.\n6. **Player 6** says Player 1 is not the criminal. Since I am indeed not the criminal (as I am an Investigator), this statement is true. However, this does not necessarily mean Player 6 is an Investigator, as the Criminal or Rumormonger could also make a true statement to blend in.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Player 3 has been consistently cleared by multiple players, including myself, which strongly suggests they are not the criminal.\n- The focus now shifts to other players. Given that Player 6 has made a true statement about me, it's possible they are trying to appear as an Investigator, but without more information, it's difficult to determine their role accurately.\n\n**Consideration of Roles**:\n- Since Lunatics believe they are Criminals and make statements that may be truthful or false, and given that no one has directly accused another of being the criminal in a way that would suggest lunatic behavior (making contradictory or obviously false statements), it seems less likely that anyone is acting as a Lunatic would, based on the information given.\n- Rumormongers could be providing false information, believing they are Investigators. If so, their statements might contradict the truth, but without a clear contradiction, it's hard to identify them based solely on Round 2's statements.\n\n**Final Judgment**:\nGiven the information and the need to make a judgment, I must consider the statements provided.

However, if Player 2 is a Rumormonger, this statement could be false.\n3. **Player 3** says Player 1 is not the criminal. Since I have accused Player 3 of being the criminal, if Player 3 is indeed the criminal, they might deny my role as the criminal to mislead. However, if Player 3 is not the criminal, this statement could be true, but given my accusation, it's a crucial piece of information to consider in the context of all statements.\n4. **Player 4** says Player 3 is not the criminal. This contradicts my statement. If Player 4 is an Investigator, then Player 3 is not the criminal, which would mean I (as an Investigator) have made a false accusation, which is not possible. Therefore, if my accusation against Player 3 is correct, Player 4 could be the Rumormonger, providing a statement that contradicts the truth.\n5. **Player 5** says Player 6 is not the criminal. Without knowing Player 5's role, this statement's truthfulness is uncertain. If Player 5 is an Investigator, then Player 6 is not the criminal. If Player 5 is the Rumormonger or the Criminal, this statement could be an attempt to mislead.\n6. **Player 6** says Player 1 is not the criminal. This is a true statement since I am an Investigator, not the criminal. However, similar to previous analyses, this does not necessarily confirm Player 6's role as an Investigator, as the Criminal or Rumormonger could also make true statements to appear credible.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- The key contradiction lies between my statement (Player 1) accusing Player 3 of being the criminal and Player 4's statement defending Player 3. Given that I am an Investigator and my statements are truthful, if I have accused Player 3 correctly, then Player 4's defense of Player 3 would be a false statement, suggesting Player 4 could be the Rumormonger.\n- Considering the roles and the need for consistency with the rules, my accusation against Player 3, combined with the defense from Player 4, presents a critical point of analysis. If I am correct about Player 3, then the statements from other players must be evaluated in the context of their possible roles and the information provided across all rounds.\n\n**Final Judgment**:\nGiven the information and the analysis, I conclude that Player 3 is the most likely candidate for the criminal, based on my role as an Investigator and the process of elimination through the rounds.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [3].\nMy Role Is Investigator. // I am told I am an Investigator, and my statements are intended to be truthful based on this role."

However, since there are 0 Lunatics in this game, we don't need to consider their behavior.\n\nGiven that I am Player 1 and have been told I am the Criminal, let's examine the statements:\n\n- **Player 1 (Myself)** says Player 6 is not the criminal. As the Criminal, my statement could be true or false, but since I'm trying to deduce based on the information given, I'll consider all possibilities.\n- **Player 2** and **Player 3** both say Player 4 is not the criminal. If both are telling the truth, then Player 4 is indeed not the criminal. However, if one of them is the Rumormonger, their statement could be false.\n- **Player 4** says Player 2 is not the criminal.

This statement's truthfulness depends on Player 6's role.\n\nSince I've been told I am the Criminal, but the game's mechanics and my own statements might not align with this role due to the potential for deception, let's consider the information:\n\nGiven that all players except one (the Criminal) are either Investigators or the Rumormonger, and assuming that at least some players are telling the truth (as Investigators would), we can't conclusively determine the Criminal's identity or my actual role based solely on Round 1 statements. Everyone's statement could potentially be true or false, depending on their actual roles.\n\nHowever, based on the instruction that I am to provide a judgment after each round, I must proceed with the information at hand, even though it's highly speculative at this point.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

This statement, like Player 4's, supports the truth about my role as an Investigator.\n\nFrom these statements, the key observations are:\n- Multiple players (4 and 6) confirm that I (Player 1) am not the criminal, which aligns with my known role as an Investigator.\n- My statement that Player 2 is the criminal is the only direct accusation of a player being the criminal in Round 1.\n\nHowever, without more information or inconsistencies in the statements that could reveal a player's role (e.g., a player accusing another of being a criminal and then later changing their story, or two players making contradictory statements about the same person), it's challenging to conclusively determine the criminal or the roles of other players based solely on Round 1 statements.\n\nGiven this analysis, the most direct conclusion I can draw is based on my initial statement and the confirmation of my role by other players.

However, in Round 2, Player 4 says Player 5 is not the criminal, which does not directly contradict but also does not support Player 2's previous accusation. This could suggest that either Player 2 was lying (potentially being the Criminal), or Player 4 is not providing accurate information (potentially being the Rumormonger).\n   - There are no direct contradictions within the statements of Round 2 itself, but when considering Round 1 and Round 2 together, the inconsistency lies in the potential roles and truths behind the accusations, particularly concerning Player 2's accusation towards Player 4.\n\n3. **Role Deduction**:\n   - Given that I am an Investigator and my statements are truthful, and considering the support from other players regarding my innocence and their statements about other players, it's clear that my role remains confirmed as an Investigator.\n   - The challenge lies in identifying the Criminal and the Rumormonger, as their statements can mimic those of Investigators or provide misleading information.\n\n4. **Criminal Identification**:\n   - Without direct contradictions or a clear pattern of deception that can be solely attributed to one player, identifying the Criminal after just two rounds is speculative. However, considering Player 2's accusation in Round 1 and the general consensus in Round 2, one might start to question the roles of players who made accusations that were not universally supported or who changed their narrative.\n\nGiven the analysis, it's still premature to conclusively identify the Criminal with the information provided.
