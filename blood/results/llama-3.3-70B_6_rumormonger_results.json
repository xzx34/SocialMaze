However, if one of them is the actual Criminal, they might falsely accuse someone else.\n- My statement (Player 1) and Player 4's statement about each other not being the criminal suggest we are both likely Investigators, given our roles and the information provided.\n\nGiven these observations and the accumulation of statements across both rounds, my judgment after Round 2 is:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 4.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

However, since I've been told I am the Criminal, and assuming my role information is correct, this statement aligns with what I know.\n4. **Player 4 says Player 1 is the criminal.** Similar to Player 3, if Player 4 is an Investigator, then this statement would be true, and it aligns with my given role.\n5. **Player 5 says Player 6 is not the criminal.** Like Player 2, this could be true if Player 5 is an Investigator or false if Player 5 is the Rumormonger.\n6. **Player 6 says Player 2 is not the criminal.** This statement could be from an Investigator (making it true), the Rumormonger (potentially false), or even the Criminal (if the Criminal was not Player 1, which contradicts my given role).\n\n**Analysis:**\n- Players 3 and 4 both accuse me (Player 1) of being the Criminal, which aligns with the role I've been given.\n- The consistency of Players 3 and 4's statements could indicate they are Investigators telling the truth.\n- Players 1, 2, and 5 all claim Player 6 is not the Criminal, which could be true or part of a deception strategy.\n- Player 6's statement about Player 2 not being the Criminal doesn't give us enough information to determine Player 6's role yet.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nGiven the information from Round 1 and considering my role as supposedly the Criminal, the statements from Players 3 and 4 directly accusing me of being the Criminal seem to align with the truthful nature expected of Investigators. However, I must consider the possibility that my role information could be misleading or that there's a Lunatic or Rumormonger providing false information. Since I've been directly told I am the Criminal and two players (3 and 4) have made statements that align with this, my current judgment leans towards believing my given role.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

This aligns with Player 3's statement and supports the notion that Player 4 might not be the criminal.\n\nFrom the accumulation of statements across all rounds, several points are clear:\n- I am an Investigator, as stated before the game.\n- **Player 6** is not the criminal, as I've consistently stated.\n- There was a contradiction in Round 1 about **Player 6**'s role, with **Player 4** claiming they were the criminal, which I know to be false.\n- In Rounds 2 and 3, there's a consensus among some players that **Player 5** is the criminal.\n\nGiven my role and the analysis:\n- My statement in Round 3 that **Player 5** is the criminal is based on the accumulation of evidence and consensus among players.\n- The fact that **Player 2**, **Player 3**, and **Player 6** have all made statements that align with my role as an Investigator (by not accusing me and by their other statements) suggests they could be Investigators or at least not the Criminal.\n- **Player 4**'s inconsistency in Round 1 and their statement in Round 3 could indicate they are the Rumormonger, given their potential for making false statements while believing they are an Investigator.\n\nConsidering all the information:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 5.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

However, given the statements, there is a strong indication that I might indeed be the Criminal, as multiple players have identified me as such, and their statements could be truthful if they are Investigators.\n\nBut, considering the roles and the statements provided:\n- If I were not the Criminal, the statements from Players 4 and 5 would be incorrect, which could indicate they are either the Rumormonger or the Criminal trying to deceive. However, given that both have pointed to me, and considering the distribution of roles (4 Investigators, 1 Criminal, 1 Rumormonger), it's more plausible that at least one of them is telling the truth, especially since their statements align with my initial role information.\n\nTherefore, based on the Round 1 statements and considering the game mechanics, my analysis leads to the following conclusion:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

However, without knowing Player 5's role, we can't conclude their intentions.\n6. **Player 6 says Player 2 is the criminal.** This is a new accusation. If Player 6 is an Investigator, then Player 2 could be the criminal. However, if Player 6 is the Criminal or the Rumormonger, this statement could be false or misleading.\n\nConsidering both rounds, we have:\n- Player 1 (myself) is an Investigator and not the criminal.\n- Player 3 and Player 4 are not the criminal, based on my statements in Rounds 1 and 2.\n- Player 5's statement in Round 2 supports the truth about Player 4 but doesn't reveal Player 5's role.\n\nThe direct accusations against Player 2 by Player 3 in Round 1 and against Player 6 by Player 2 in both rounds, and against Player 2 by Player 6 in Round 2, create confusion. Without more information, it's challenging to definitively identify the criminal. However, the consistent accusations against Player 2 and Player 6 warrant closer examination.\n\nSince I am certain of my role as an Investigator and have provided truthful information, and given the current lack of conclusive evidence to pinpoint the criminal, I must continue to analyze the statements for inconsistencies and patterns that might emerge in the next round.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player Unknown.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

However, there are 0 Lunatics in this game, so we don't need to consider their behavior.\n\nGiven the statements:\n\n- **Player 1** (myself) says Player 4 is not the criminal.

This could be true or false depending on Player 2's role.\n- **Player 3** says Player 1 (myself) is the criminal. If Player 3 were an Investigator, this would mean I am the Criminal, which contradicts my given role. Thus, Player 3 is likely not an Investigator.\n- **Player 4** says Player 3 is not the criminal.

It supports the possibility that Player 2 could be an Investigator, despite previous accusations against them.\n3. **Player 3 says Player 5 is not the criminal.** This statement aligns with mine, suggesting that Player 3 is also an Investigator or at least providing truthful information in this instance.\n4. **Player 4 says Player 6 is not the criminal.** This statement introduces a new claim. If Player 4 is an Investigator, then Player 6 is not the criminal. Given the previous accusations against Player 2 by Player 4, this could indicate that Player 4 is trying to provide helpful information, possibly being an Investigator but with previous incorrect accusations due to the influence of the Rumormonger or confusion.\n5. **Player 5 says Player 3 is not the criminal.** This statement supports the notion that Player 3 is not the criminal, which is consistent with the information provided by Players 1 and 3 themselves.\n6. **Player 6 says Player 3 is not the criminal.** This repeats the statement made by Player 5, further reinforcing that Player 3 is likely not the criminal.\n\nConsidering all rounds, several points are clear:\n- I am an Investigator, as stated and supported by various statements.\n- Players 3 and 5 are likely not the criminal, based on the consistent statements from multiple players, including myself.\n- Player 2, despite being accused by Players 4 and 6 in previous rounds, is defended by my statement and now defends me, suggesting that the initial accusations might have been misleading or false.\n\nGiven the pattern of statements and the rules of the game, it seems that Players 4 and 6 might have been providing false or misleading information in previous rounds, potentially due to one of them being the Rumormonger or the Criminal. However, in Round 3, the statements seem to clarify and support the innocence of several players, including myself, Player 3, and Player 5.\n\nThe Criminal's identity remains unclear based solely on the statements provided, as the game's mechanics allow for misleading information. However, given the defense of Player 2 by myself and the lack of consistent accusation against any single player in Round 3, it's possible that the Criminal is among those who have been less consistently accused or have provided statements that could be seen as defensive or misleading.\n\n**Final Judgment:**\n**Final Criminal Is Player 4.**\n**My Role Is Investigator.**"

As I am told I am an Investigator, this statement should be truthful.\n2. **Player 2** says Player 4 is the criminal. This contradicts my statement. If I am indeed an Investigator, then Player 2 could either be the Criminal (trying to mislead) or the Rumormonger (believing they are an Investigator but providing incorrect information).\n3. **Player 3** says Player 5 is not the criminal. Without knowing Player 3's role, we cannot immediately assess the truthfulness of this statement.\n4. **Player 4** says Player 1 (myself) is not the criminal. If Player 4 were the Criminal, they would not necessarily have a motive to lie about me being the Criminal since I've already stated they are not the Criminal. However, this statement supports my claim of not being the Criminal, which aligns with what I know about myself.\n5. **Player 5** says Player 6 is not the criminal. Similar to Player 3's statement, without knowing Player 5's role, we cannot assess the truthfulness.\n6. **Player 6** says Player 1 (myself) is not the criminal. This supports my own statement and Player 4's statement about me, but again, without knowing Player 6's role, it's difficult to determine the motive or truthfulness.\n\nGiven the information from Round 1 and knowing that I am an Investigator, we have a direct contradiction between my statement and Player 2's statement regarding Player 4. Since I am confident in my role as an Investigator and thus the truthfulness of my statements, Player 2's contradictory statement suggests that Player 2 might be either the Criminal or the Rumormonger.\n\nHowever, without more information or further analysis of the roles and potential motives of other players, it's challenging to definitively identify the Criminal based solely on Round 1 statements. The lack of clear evidence pointing directly to one player as the Criminal means that, while I can speculate about roles based on contradictions and supporting statements, making a definitive judgment on the Criminal's identity is premature.\n\nTherefore, based on the Round 1 statements:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player Unknown.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

Without knowing Player 3's role, this statement's truthfulness is uncertain. However, it's interesting that Player 3 supports Player 2, who has contradicted me.\n4. **Player 4** says Player 5 is not the criminal. Player 4 previously agreed with me about not being the criminal themselves. This statement doesn't provide direct insight into Player 4's role but suggests they are not claiming Player 5 is the criminal.\n5. **Player 5** says Player 3 is not the criminal. This statement, like Player 4's, doesn't directly indicate Player 5's role but suggests they believe Player 3 is not the criminal.\n6. **Player 6** says Player 3 is not the criminal. This statement aligns with Player 5's but, given my accusation towards Player 6, needs to be considered with skepticism regarding their potential role as the Criminal.\n\nConsidering both rounds, the key contradiction lies between my statements and Player 2's statements. In Round 1, I said Player 4 was not the criminal, and Player 2 contradicted me by saying Player 4 was the criminal. In Round 2, I accused Player 6, and Player 2 defended Player 6. This consistent contradiction suggests that Player 2 is likely not an Investigator, making them a potential candidate for either the Criminal or the Rumormonger. However, since the Rumormonger believes they are an Investigator and provides potentially incorrect information, and given that Player 2's statements directly oppose mine (and I know I'm an Investigator), it leans more towards Player 2 being the Criminal, as the Criminal has a motive to directly contradict truthful statements to cause confusion.\n\nGiven this analysis:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 2.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

If Player 2 were a Rumormonger or the Criminal, the statement might not be reliable. But since I've stated Player 2 is not the criminal, if Player 2 is indeed an Investigator, then Player 6 could potentially be the criminal.\n3. **Player 3 says Player 4 is not the criminal.** Without knowing Player 3's role, we cannot immediately verify the truth of this statement.\n4. **Player 4 says Player 5 is the criminal.** Similar to Player 3's statement, without knowing Player 4's role, the reliability of this statement is uncertain.\n5. **Player 5 says Player 3 is not the criminal.** Again, the truth of this statement depends on Player 5's role.\n6. **Player 6 says Player 4 is the criminal.** If Player 6 were an Investigator, this would be a reliable statement. However, since Player 2 accused Player 6 of being the criminal, and I believe Player 2 is not the criminal (based on my own statement), Player 6's statement could be an attempt to deflect if they are indeed the criminal or could be a truthful statement if they are an Investigator.\n\nGiven the information from Round 1, it's challenging to definitively identify the criminal or the roles of all players.

I've claimed Player 5 is the criminal and then said Player 4 is not the criminal.\n- Player 2's false accusation against me suggests they might not be an Investigator, potentially being the Criminal or a Rumormonger.\n- The contradiction between my claim about Player 5 and the claims by Players 3 and 6 that Player 5 is not the criminal suggests that either I am incorrect (which is not possible if I am indeed an Investigator), or Players 3 and 6 are not Investigators.\n\nGiven this analysis, my role as an Investigator is confirmed by my own knowledge, but identifying the criminal requires resolving these contradictions.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 2.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

Player 6 is not the criminal.\n\n2. **Player 2 says Player 4 is not the criminal.** This could be true or false depending on Player 2's role. If Player 2 is an Investigator, then Player 4 is not the criminal. If Player 2 is the Rumormonger or the Criminal, this statement might be an attempt to mislead.\n\n3. **Player 3 says Player 4 is not the criminal.** Similar to Player 2's statement, this could be true if Player 3 is an Investigator, or false if Player 3 is either the Rumormonger or the Criminal.\n\n4. **Player 4 says Player 3 is not the criminal.** Again, the truth of this statement depends on Player 4's role. If an Investigator, then true. If Rumormonger or Criminal, potentially false.\n\n5. **Player 5 says Player 2 is the criminal.** If Player 5 is an Investigator, then Player 2 is indeed the criminal. However, if Player 5 is the Rumormonger or the Criminal, this statement is meant to deceive.\n\n6. **Player 6 says Player 1 is the criminal.** Given that I know I am an Investigator and not the criminal, Player 6's statement is false. This means Player 6 cannot be an Investigator, as they would know the truth. Player 6 could be the Rumormonger, believing they are telling the truth, or the Criminal, trying to mislead.\n\nFrom the statements, we can make some deductions:\n- Since I (Player 1) am an Investigator and said Player 6 is not the criminal, and Player 6 falsely accused me, Player 6 is likely either the Rumormonger or the Criminal. However, since I've already stated Player 6 is not the criminal based on my Investigator knowledge, Player 6 is more likely the Rumormonger.\n- Player 5 accused Player 2 of being the criminal. If Player 5 is an Investigator, then Player 2 is the criminal. However, we cannot confirm Player 5's role yet.\n- Players 2, 3, and 4 all made statements that could be true or false based on their roles.

But given my role and statement, I initially stick with my assessment.\n- **Player 4** says **Player 6** is not the criminal.\n- **Player 5** says **Player 1** is not the criminal. This supports Player 3's statement but does not directly impact the identification of the criminal.\n- **Player 6** says **Player 4** is not the criminal.\n\nAt this point, it's challenging to definitively identify the criminal or the roles of all players with certainty because we have conflicting information:\n\n- If **Player 1** (myself) is correct that **Player 3** is the criminal, then Player 3's statement about me not being the criminal could be a lie or truth, but as an Investigator, my statement should be trusted.\n- **Player 2** and **Player 4**'s statements about **Player 6** being the criminal and not being the criminal, respectively, create confusion but don't directly help without knowing their roles.\n\nGiven this analysis and the fact that I am told I am an Investigator, my initial judgment after Round 1 would be:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 3.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

This contrasts with their previous statement about **Player 6** being the criminal, which could indicate **Player 2** is either a Rumormonger providing inconsistent information or a Criminal trying to mislead.\n   - **Player 5** says **Player 3** is not the criminal, which directly contradicts my statement.

However, **Player 5** could also be a Rumormonger or the Criminal themselves.\n\n3. **Role Consistency**:\n   - Since I am told I am an Investigator, my role is to provide truthful information. My statements have been consistent regarding **Player 3** being the criminal.\n   - The other players' statements and potential roles are less clear, with **Player 2**, **Player 4**, **Player 5**, and **Player 6** providing information that could be true or false based on their unknown roles.\n\nGiven this analysis, my judgment after Round 2 remains cautious but still leans on the information I have as an Investigator:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 3.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

This change might seem inconsistent, but as an Investigator, I am providing what I believe to be true based on the information available to me up to this point.\n   - **Player 3** has consistently said I (**Player 1**) am not the criminal, which supports the idea that I am indeed not the criminal, but does not necessarily clear Player 3 of being the criminal.\n   - **Player 2** now says **Player 6** is the criminal, which is a different target than in Round 1 (**Player 6**) and Round 2 (**Player 5**). This inconsistency could suggest **Player 2** is either a Rumormonger or the Criminal trying to mislead.\n   - **Player 4**, **Player 5**, and **Player 6** all say I (**Player 1**) am not the criminal, which aligns with what would be expected from truthful Investigators or potentially from a Rumormonger/Criminal trying to avoid suspicion.\n\n2. **Potential Roles**:\n   - Given the inconsistencies and the information provided, **Player 2**'s changing accusations could indicate they are the Criminal trying to confuse others or a Rumormonger providing incorrect information.\n   - **Player 3**'s consistent defense of me (**Player 1**) not being the criminal, combined with my initial accusation of them, creates a complex situation. If **Player 3** were the Criminal, they might be expected to lie about my role or their own, but they have consistently denied my criminality.\n   - **Player 4**, **Player 5**, and **Player 6**'s statements that I am not the criminal support the notion that I am indeed not the criminal, but their roles remain unclear.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - Considering all statements and the potential for deception, I must rely on my role as an Investigator to provide truthful information. My initial accusation of **Player 3** was based on the information I had at the time, but the consistent statements from other players defending me and the inconsistencies from **Player 2** lead me to reconsider.\n\nGiven this analysis, my judgment after Round 3 is:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 2.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

However, since there are 0 Lunatics in this game, we don't need to consider this role.\n\nGiven the statements:\n\n- Player 1 (myself) says Player 6 is not the criminal. As an Investigator, I am truthful, so Player 6 is indeed not the criminal.\n- Player 2 says Player 1 is not the criminal. This supports my role as an Investigator since I know I'm not the criminal.\n- Player 3 says Player 6 is not the criminal. This aligns with my statement and could indicate Player 3 is also an Investigator or at least not providing misleading information in this round.\n- Player 4 says Player 6 is not the criminal. Similar to Player 3, this could indicate Player 4 is an Investigator or not providing false information.\n- Player 5 says Player 3 is the criminal. This is a significant statement because if Player 5 were an Investigator, they would be telling the truth. However, if Player 5 is not an Investigator, this statement could be a lie.\n- Player 6 says Player 4 is not the criminal. Given that I've already stated Player 6 is not the criminal and this statement aligns with truthful information, it suggests Player 6 could be an Investigator or at least not a Criminal.\n\nConsidering these statements, the only conflicting information comes from Player 5 accusing Player 3 of being the criminal, while multiple players (including myself, an known Investigator) have stated that other players are not the criminal, creating a consensus around certain players not being the criminal.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- Since I am an Investigator and have stated that Player 6 is not the criminal, and this is supported by other players, we can conclude that Player 6 is indeed not the criminal.\n- The statement from Player 5 accusing Player 3 of being the criminal stands out as potentially false, given the consensus around Player 6 and the lack of accusation towards Player 5 themselves from other potential Investigators.\n\n**Conclusion after Round 1:**\nGiven the information, it's too early to definitively identify the criminal with absolute certainty, but based on the pattern of statements, Player 5's accusation of Player 3 is the most suspicious, considering the supportive statements from other players about certain individuals not being the criminal. However, without more information, pinpointing the criminal precisely is challenging.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player Unknown.\nMy Role Is Investigator."
