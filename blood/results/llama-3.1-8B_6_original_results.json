If I'm actually the criminal, then my statement could be a clever attempt to deflect attention from myself.\n\nHowever, looking at the other statements, I notice that Player 2, Player 4, and Player 5 all say that Player 2 is not the criminal. This is a suspicious pattern, similar to what I saw in Round 1. Given that I'm the actual criminal, I should be aware of how a Lunatic or a Rumormonger would behave.\n\nConsidering the statements from all three rounds, I'm going to re-evaluate my previous judgments. In Round 1, I suspected that one of the players (Player 2, Player 4, or Player 5) might be a Lunatic. In Round 2, I considered the possibility that Player 6 was trying to mislead me.\n\nHowever, in Round 3, I made a statement that might seem incriminating, but it's also possible that I'm trying to mislead others. Given the pattern of statements, I'm going to take a closer look at the players who consistently pointed out Player 2 as not being the criminal.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 2.\nMy Role Is Unknown."

This statement is interesting because it directly contradicts my current statement that Player 2 is the criminal. However, I'm an Investigator, and I should be providing consistent information. This statement could be a sign that Player 6 is a Rumormonger or a Lunatic trying to confuse others.\n\nConsidering the statements from Round 2, I'm more confident that Player 2 is the criminal. The inconsistency in my previous statement, combined with the statements from other players, suggests that I might have been misled earlier.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 2.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

If Player 6 were the criminal, it's unlikely that they would claim Player 1 is not the criminal.\n\nConsidering the statements, I notice that:\n\n- Players 1, 4, and 5 consistently point to each other as not being the criminal, which suggests they might be on the same team.\n- Player 2's statement about Player 1 is inconsistent with other statements, which confirms my suspicion that Player 2 is a Rumormonger.\n- Player 3's statement about Player 6 is inconsistent, which makes me even more confident that Player 3 is a Lunatic.\n- Player 6's statement about Player 1 is consistent with other statements, which makes me less likely to suspect Player 6 as the criminal.\n\nBased on the analysis, I'm confident in the following conclusion:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 3.\nMy Role Is Investigator.\n\nI'm confident that I'm an Investigator, and I believe that Player 3 is the most likely candidate for the criminal role."

This means Player 3 is indeed not the criminal.\n- Player 2 says Player 4 is the criminal. Since I don't know Player 2's role, I need to consider possibilities. If Player 2 is an Investigator, this statement is truthful. If Player 2 is a Rumormonger or a Lunatic, the statement could be false.\n- Player 3 says Player 1 (myself) is not the criminal. As previously mentioned, Player 3's statement about me is consistent, which suggests they might be an Investigator.\n- Player 4 says Player 5 is not the criminal. This statement is consistent with the initial suspicion that Player 4 might be the criminal, as they are trying to deflect suspicion from themselves.\n- Player 5 says Player 3 is not the criminal. Similar to Player 2, I don't know Player 5's role, so I need to consider possibilities. If Player 5 is an Investigator, this statement is truthful. If Player 5 is a Rumormonger or a Lunatic, the statement could be false.\n- Player 6 says Player 2 is not the criminal. This statement is consistent with the initial statements from Player 6, where they said Player 3 and Player 6 is not the criminal.\n\nConsidering the new statements, I can see that:\n\n- Player 3's statements about me are consistent, which suggests they might be an Investigator.\n- Player 4's statement about Player 5 is trying to deflect suspicion, which could be a sign that Player 4 is the criminal.\n- Player 2's statement about Player 4 is suspicious, as it could be a coordinated effort to deceive others. However, it's also possible Player 2 is an Investigator providing truthful information.\n\nBased on the available information, I have some updated suspicions:\n\n- Player 4 is still a strong suspect, as they are trying to deflect suspicion from themselves.\n- Player 3's consistent statements about me suggest they might be an Investigator.\n- Player 2's statement about Player 4 is suspicious, but it's also possible they are an Investigator providing truthful information.\n\nGiven the conflicting information and the rules of the game, I will make a final judgment based on the most consistent evidence.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 4.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

This consistency suggests that Player 3 is likely not the criminal, as both Investigators agree.\n- Player 3 says Player 5 is not the criminal. This statement is consistent with the behavior of an Investigator, as it's a truthful claim about another player.\n- Player 4 says Player 6 is the criminal. This statement could be from a Rumormonger (who believes they are an Investigator but provides incorrect information) or a Lunatic (who believes they are the criminal but provides truthful or false information). However, given the context, it's more likely that Player 4 is not an Investigator, as the other players haven't accused them of being the criminal yet.\n- Player 5 says Player 2 is not the criminal. This statement could be from an Investigator or a Lunatic (who might claim another player is not the criminal to throw off the group). However, given the other statements, it's more likely that Player 5 is not the criminal.\n- Player 6 says Player 2 is not the criminal. This statement could be from a Rumormonger or a Lunatic, but given the other statements, it's more likely that Player 6 is not the criminal.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most likely candidate for the criminal is Player 4, as they are the only one who has made a statement accusing another player (Player 6) of being the criminal. However, without more information, it's difficult to determine if Player 4 is a Rumormonger or a Lunatic.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 4.\nMy Role Is Investigator."
