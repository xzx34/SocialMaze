This statement is consistent with Player 5's attempts to deflect suspicion, but it's also a self-vindicating statement that could be true or false.\n- Player 4 says Player 2 is not the criminal. This statement is consistent with Player 2's statement, which could be true or a coordinated effort to deceive.\n- Player 5 says Player 3 is the criminal. This statement is a desperate attempt to deflect suspicion from themselves and point to another player, which is consistent with a Lunatic's behavior.\n- Player 6 says Player 1 is not the criminal. This statement is suspicious, as it's a self-vindicating statement from a player who could be a Rumormonger or a Lunatic.\n\nConsidering the final round of statements, I notice that Player 5's behavior is consistent with a Lunatic's behavior, as they are making desperate attempts to deflect suspicion and point to other players. I also notice that Player 6's statement is suspicious, as it's a self-vindicating statement that could be an attempt to deceive.\n\nBased on the analysis, I will make the following judgment:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 5.\nMy Role Is Investigator.\n\nHowever, I must consider the possibility that I am incorrect about my role. Given the suspicious statements from Players 2 and 6, I could be a Rumormonger or a Lunatic, but I still lean towards being an Investigator based on my previous judgments."

As a Rumormonger, Player 2 would provide incorrect information, but they would believe they are an Investigator. However, if Player 2 were a Rumormonger, they would not have made a statement about Player 4 in Round 2. This makes me think that Player 2 might be a Lunatic.\n\nPlayer 4's statement, saying Player 5 is not the criminal, seems consistent with the behavior of an Investigator.\n\nPlayers 5 and 6 make statements about each other, but their statements don't provide any direct information about my role or their roles.\n\nConsidering the possibilities, I will make the following judgment:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 2.\nMy Role Is Unknown.\n\nHowever, I'm not entirely confident in my previous judgment. Player 3's accurate statement about me makes me wonder if I might be an Investigator. But, considering the rules, I think it's more likely that I am a Lunatic, and Player 3 is an Investigator who correctly identified me."

This is a strong indication that Player 4 is a Rumormonger, as they provided incorrect information in Round 1.\n\nGiven the statements in Round 3, I'm confident that Player 4 is indeed the Rumormonger. I also re-evaluate the statements about Player 5 and Player 6, and I notice that Player 5 has consistently provided statements that are consistent with the other players. Given the consistency, it's possible that Player 5 is an Investigator.\n\nHowever, I also notice that Player 2 has consistently provided statements that are consistent with the other players, except for their statement about Player 4 in Round 1. Given the information, it's possible that Player 2 is the criminal, as they might be trying to mislead others.\n\nBased on the analysis, I'm confident that Player 4 is the Rumormonger, and I suspect that Player 2 might be the criminal.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 2.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

Since I am Player 1 and I am an Investigator, my statement must be truthful. This means I believe Player 6 is not the criminal.\n\n2. **Player 2's statement:** Player 2 says Player 3 is not the criminal. This statement could be truthful if Player 2 is an Investigator, or it could be false if Player 2 is a Rumormonger or a Lunatic trying to mislead.\n\n3. **Player 3's statement:** Player 3 says Player 5 is the criminal. This statement could be truthful if Player 3 is an Investigator, or it could be false if Player 3 is a Rumormonger or a Lunatic trying to mislead. If Player 3 is a Lunatic, this statement could be truthful or false, but since Lunatics believe they are Criminals, they might be more inclined to point to someone else as the criminal.\n\n4. **Player 4's statement:** Player 4 says Player 6 is not the criminal. Similar to Player 2's statement, this could be truthful if Player 4 is an Investigator, or it could be false if Player 4 is a Rumormonger or a Lunatic trying to mislead.\n\n5. **Player 5's statement:** Player 5 says Player 6 is not the criminal. This statement could be truthful if Player 5 is an Investigator, or it could be false if Player 5 is a Rumormonger or a Lunatic trying to mislead. Given that Player 3 accused Player 5 of being the criminal, if Player 5 is indeed the criminal, it would be surprising for Player 5 to accuse Player 6 and not defend themselves.\n\n6. **Player 6's statement:** Player 6 says Player 3 is not the criminal. This statement could be truthful if Player 6 is an Investigator, or it could be false if Player 6 is a Rumormonger or a Lunatic trying to mislead.\n\n**Initial Observations:**\n- Player 1 (myself) believes Player 6 is not the criminal.\n- Players 2, 4, and 5 all believe Player 6 is not the criminal.\n- Player 6 believes Player 3 is not the criminal.\n- Player 3 believes Player 5 is the criminal.\n\n**Analysis:**\nGiven the consistency in Player 2, 4, 5, and 6's statements that Player 6 is not the criminal, it seems likely that at least some of these players are Investigators. However, if Player 6 is an Investigator, it's puzzling why they would say Player 3 is not the criminal, given that no one else has accused Player 3. If Player 6 is a Rumormonger, they might be trying to create confusion.\n\n**Deduction:**\nGiven the statements, I cannot confidently determine the criminal's identity or my own role beyond being an Investigator. The information does not align perfectly with any role, and there are too many variables (Rumormongers and Lunatics) to make a definitive conclusion in the first round. Therefore, my current analysis is inconclusive.\n\n**Final Judgment for Round 1:**\nFinal Criminal Is Unknown.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

Player 6 says Player 4 is not the criminal. This statement can be either true or false. It's difficult to deduce Player 6's role directly from this statement.\n\nConsidering the statements from Round 3, I notice that Player 3 has consistently said someone is not the Criminal, which could be an attempt to mislead others as a Lunatic. Given the possibilities, it's still difficult to determine my role or the role of other players with certainty.\n\nHowever, I will take a closer look at the statements from all rounds. I notice that Player 3 has consistently provided statements that could be attempts to mislead others. Considering this, I will take a chance and assume that Player 3 is a Lunatic, and they are actually the Criminal.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 3.\nMy Role Is Unknown."
