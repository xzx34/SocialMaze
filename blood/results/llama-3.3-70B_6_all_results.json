However, without a clear pattern of truthfulness that aligns with the known behaviors of Investigators, this remains speculative.\n- Player 2's inconsistent statements across rounds, including the potential for false information, align more with the behavior expected of the Lunatic or possibly the Rumormonger, though the Lunatic's belief they are the Criminal and provision of potentially true or false statements make them a stronger candidate for this role.\n- Player 5's statement contradicting others about Player 2 could indicate they are the Rumormonger, providing incorrect information while believing they are an Investigator.\n\nGiven the analysis, while the exact roles of all players are not definitively determined due to the complexity and the potential for deception, the Criminal's identity is clear to me as I am Player 1.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

This statement, similar to others, lacks context without knowing Player 6's role. If Player 6 is an Investigator, then Player 2 is not the criminal. If Player 6 is not an Investigator, this could be a false statement.\n\nConsidering both rounds, the consistent accusation towards Player 5 as the criminal by multiple players (including myself, an known Investigator) in Round 1, and the lack of strong contradictory evidence in Round 2, still points towards Player 5 being the criminal. Additionally, my statement and Player 3's statement in Round 2 suggest that Player 3 is likely not the criminal, and by extension, could be another Investigator or at least not the criminal.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 5.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

As an Investigator, I must have had a reason to suspect Player 3 based on the information gathered up to this point. However, considering my previous statement that Player 3 is not the criminal, this change indicates I've reevaluated the information and now believe Player 3 could be the criminal.\n- Player 2 says Player 3 is not the criminal. Given that I, an Investigator, have changed my stance on Player 3, and if Player 2 were also an Investigator, this disagreement would be unusual. This could suggest Player 2 is not an Investigator, or there's a misunderstanding based on the information each has.\n- Player 3 says Player 5 is the criminal. This statement aligns with the majority suspicion from earlier rounds. If Player 3 is indeed the criminal, as I now suspect, this could be a tactic to deflect attention.\n- Player 4 says Player 3 is not the criminal. This contradicts my current suspicion. If Player 4 is an Investigator, this would mean Player 3 is not the criminal, which would put my own judgment in question.\n- Player 5 says Player 1 is not the criminal. This is true, as I am an Investigator. However, coming from Player 5, who has been accused of being the criminal, this statement could be an attempt to appear cooperative or truthful.\n- Player 6 says Player 2 is not the criminal. Similar to previous statements, without knowing Player 6's role, this could be true or an attempt to mislead.\n\nGiven the conflicting information, especially the change in my own stance towards Player 3 and the disagreement among players about Player 3's role, the situation has become more complex. However, considering the initial consensus and the fact that I, as an Investigator, have reason to believe Player 3 might be the criminal based on the information gathered, it's possible that the initial suspicion towards Player 5 was a misdirection.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 3.\nMy Role Is Investigator."
