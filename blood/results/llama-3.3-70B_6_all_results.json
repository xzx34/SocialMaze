However, if Player 6 were the criminal, they might also falsely accuse someone else, but in this case, the accusation against Player 3 is consistent across multiple players.\n\nConsidering the statements from both rounds:\n\n- The consistent accusations against Player 3 by different players (including myself indirectly through the process of elimination and direct accusations by Players 5 and 6) strengthen the hypothesis that Player 3 is the criminal.\n- Player 2's statements in both rounds align with the truth (from my perspective as an Investigator), suggesting Player 2 is likely another Investigator.\n- The contradiction between Players 3 and 4 regarding Player 6, combined with the potential for Player 3 to be the criminal, suggests that Player 4's statement might be truthful, but it's crucial to consider the source and potential biases.\n\nFinal Judgment After Round 2:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 3.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

This statement aligns with our suspicion from Rounds 1 and 2 that Player 2 might be the criminal.\n5. **Player 5** says Player 1 is the criminal. This statement is false because I am an Investigator, not the criminal. This indicates that Player 5 is not an Investigator.\n6. **Player 6** says Player 3 is not the criminal. This statement does not provide new information that would significantly alter our current understanding.\n\nFrom Round 3, we can observe:\n\n- **Player 2**'s statement about Player 5 not being the criminal could be an attempt to deflect or mislead, consistent with the behavior of a potential criminal.\n- **Player 4**'s direct accusation of Player 2 being the criminal supports our ongoing suspicion.\n- **Player 5**'s false accusation of me (Player 1) being the criminal indicates that Player 5 is not an Investigator and could potentially be the Rumormonger or Lunatic, given their incorrect statement.\n\nConsidering all rounds, the key points are:\n\n- **Player 2** has been suspected of being the criminal since Round 1 due to their false statement, and this suspicion is reinforced by their behavior in subsequent rounds.\n- **Player 5**'s false statement in Round 3 indicates they are not an Investigator.\n- My own role as an Investigator is confirmed by my consistent truthful statements.\n\n**Final Judgment after Round 3:**\nFinal Criminal Is Player [2].\nMy Role Is Investigator.\n\nThis conclusion is based on the accumulation of evidence across all rounds, particularly the false statements and suspicious behavior attributed to Player 2, and the confirmation of my own role as an Investigator through my consistently truthful statements."
