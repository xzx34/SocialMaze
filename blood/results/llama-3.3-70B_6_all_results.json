However, the game's progression and the statements from others might reveal more about the actual roles and the criminal's identity.\n\nGiven the current analysis and the information from both rounds:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 5.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

However, since multiple players, including myself, have stated that Player 5 is not the Criminal, and assuming those statements are truthful (given the presence of multiple Investigators), Player 5's statement about Player 4 could be seen as potentially truthful but needs more context regarding Player 5's actual role.\n\n- **Player 6** says **Player 5 is the Criminal**. Given that multiple players (including myself, an Investigator) have stated that Player 5 is not the Criminal, if Player 6's statement contradicts this, it might indicate that Player 6 is either the Criminal or the Lunatic, trying to mislead or confuse.\n\n**Analysis**:\nGiven the information and my role as an Investigator, I can confidently say that I am indeed an Investigator as I have been told. The statements from Players 1, 2, and 3 (including myself) consistently indicate that Player 5 is not the Criminal, which aligns with the behavior of Investigators providing truthful information.\n\nThe contradictory statement from Player 6, claiming Player 5 is the Criminal, suggests that Player 6 might be attempting to deceive, which could align with the role of either the Criminal or the Lunatic. However, without more information, it's challenging to definitively conclude Player 6's role or the Criminal's identity based solely on Round 1 statements.\n\n**Final Judgment**:\nGiven the analysis, I lean towards believing that Player 6 might be involved in deception, but I do not have enough information to conclusively determine the Criminal's identity. However, based on the majority consensus that Player 5 is not the Criminal and considering the potential for Player 6 to be misleading, my tentative conclusion after Round 1 would focus on the role identification and the process of elimination for the Criminal.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 6.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

If Player 4 were an Investigator, this would be true, but since I am analyzing as if I might actually be the Criminal based on initial information, this could be a truthful statement from an Investigator or a false statement from another role.\n\n5. **Player 5 says Player 4 is the criminal.** This mirrors Player 2's statement, offering no clear indication without more context.\n\n6. **Player 6 says Player 2 is not the criminal.** Again, the truthfulness depends on Player 6's role.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- Players 2 and 5 both accuse Player 4, which could indicate that Player 4 is indeed the Criminal if one of these players is an Investigator. However, it could also be a ploy by the Criminal or Lunatic to mislead.\n- My statement (Player 1) and Player 4's statement about each other not being the Criminal are direct contradictions to the accusations made by Players 2 and 5. Given my initial instruction that I am the Criminal, but considering the dynamics of the game, it's crucial to analyze further statements to solidify any conclusions.\n\n**Conclusion After Round 1:**\nGiven the initial round and my role as supposedly the Criminal, but without concrete evidence to support or refute my role definitively based on the statements provided, my analysis is speculative. However, considering the game's mechanics and the goal to identify the Criminal and my role, I must proceed with caution and consider all possibilities.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Unknown, due to insufficient conclusive evidence].\nMy Role Is [Unknown, as the analysis does not conclusively support my initial role assignment based on Round 1 statements alone]."

If Player 3 is indeed an Investigator, then my initial role assignment as the Criminal could be correct.\n- The contradictory statements between Players 3 and 4, with Player 5 supporting Player 3's innocence, create a complex web.

This contradicts the statements made by Player 1 and Player 4, suggesting that either Player 5 is lying (which could be the case if Player 5 is the Criminal or another deceptive role), or Player 5 believes Player 6 is the Criminal (possibly due to being a Rumormonger or having incorrect information).\n6. **Player 6** says Player 5 is not the criminal. This statement directly contradicts the accusations made against Player 5 by Player 1 and Player 4, adding to the confusion.\n\nGiven these statements and the game's rules, let's consider the possibilities:\n\n- The repeated accusation against Player 5 by different players (Player 1 and Player 4) could suggest that Player 5 is indeed the Criminal, especially if these players are telling the truth or if their statements are designed to deceive in a coordinated manner.\n- The contradiction between statements regarding Player 5's and Player 6's roles indicates deception or misinformation, which aligns with the presence of a Rumormonger and/or a Lunatic in the game.\n\nConsidering the information from both rounds and the potential roles of each player, it seems there's a significant focus on Player 5 being the Criminal, based on the accusations from Round 2. However, without clearer evidence of each player's role, the judgment remains tentative.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 5.\nMy Role Is Unknown."

Given that I, as an Investigator, have not directly accused anyone of being the Criminal except by stating who is not, and considering the patterns of statements, this accusation against Player 5 is significant. Player 5 has made inconsistent statements, first accusing me (which was false) and then later stating I was not the criminal (which is true). This inconsistency could suggest that Player 5 is the Lunatic, as Lunatics believe they are the Criminal and can make truthful or false statements. Alternatively, Player 5 could be the Rumormonger or even the Criminal trying to deceive, but their earlier false accusation against me followed by a true statement makes their behavior somewhat erratic.\n\nGiven the information from all three rounds, the most consistent pattern that emerges is that Players 2, 3, and 4 have made statements that are either true or have not been directly contradicted by other truthful players. Player 5's behavior has been inconsistent, and Player 6's accusation against Player 5 in Round 3 could be seen as a potential reveal, especially considering that as an Investigator, I have ruled out Players 3 and 6 as the Criminal in my statements.\n\nHowever, the key to solving this puzzle lies in identifying the consistent truth-tellers and the erratic behavior of potential non-Investigators. Given that I am an Investigator and have stated truths about other players not being the Criminal, and considering the statements from all rounds, the picture becomes clearer.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 5.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

Based on the analysis of all statements and considering the potential roles and behaviors of the players, I conclude:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 4.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

However, with the given statements, we cannot definitively identify who the Investigators are yet.\n\n- **Self-Analysis as Player 1**: Given I am told I am the Criminal, but analyzing as if my role could be different to apply logic, if I were not the Criminal, my initial statement about Player 4 could be seen as an attempt to mislead, characteristic of a Criminal or possibly a Lunatic or Rumormonger. However, the game states I am the Criminal, so I should consider that my statements might not align with the truth to confuse others.\n\n**Conclusion After Round 1**:\nGiven the information and trying to deduce based on the roles and statements, it's challenging to conclusively determine the Criminal or other roles with certainty after just one round.

However, if Player 3 is not an Investigator, this statement could be misleading.\n\n4. **Player 4 says Player 2 is not the criminal.** Similar to Player 2's statement, this could be from any role, but if Player 4 is indeed not the Criminal (as I, Player 1, claimed), this could potentially align with truthful information or deception.\n\n5. **Player 5 says Player 4 is the criminal.** This statement mirrors Player 3's, suggesting either agreement in a potential truth or a coordinated attempt to mislead.\n\n6. **Player 6 says Player 5 is the criminal.** This introduces another claim about who the Criminal might be, which could be true if Player 6 is an Investigator or false if from any other role trying to mislead.\n\nGiven the statements, we see conflicting claims about Players 4 and 5 being the Criminal, with Players 3 and 5 accusing Player 4, and Player 6 accusing Player 5. Since I (Player 1) am told I am the Criminal but must analyze based on the statements given:\n\n- **Investigator(s)** would always tell the truth, but without knowing who the Investigators are, it's hard to discern truth from deception.\n- **Rumormonger(s)** and **Lunatic(s)** could provide false information, making it challenging to determine their roles based solely on Round 1 statements.\n\n**Deduction for Round 1:**\n\nGiven that my role is stated as the Criminal, but considering the possibility that the information given to me might be part of the game's deception (especially since I'm analyzing based on the statements of others who may also be deceived or attempting to deceive), it's crucial to note that my initial \"knowledge\" of being the Criminal could be false, given the nature of the Lunatic's role who believes they are the Criminal but might not be.\n\nHowever, based on the statements alone and the roles' behaviors:\n- The statements accusing Player 4 of being the Criminal come from Players 3 and 5. If both are telling the truth, they could be Investigators, but this contradicts the initial setup since we cannot have two truthful accusers unless one is not an Investigator.\n- Player 6's statement about Player 5 being the Criminal introduces another potential truth or deception.\n\n**Conclusion After Round 1:**\n\nGiven the setup and the statements, it's too early to conclusively determine the roles or the true Criminal with certainty without making assumptions. However, the analysis must proceed with the information given and the understanding that only Investigators provide consistently truthful information.\n\n**Final Judgment After Round 1:**\nFinal Criminal Is Player Unknown.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

However, it's also possible for a Rumormonger to mistakenly identify someone as the criminal.\n\n4. **Player 4 says Player 6 is not the criminal.** This statement agrees with mine, suggesting that Player 4 could also be an Investigator or at least not the Criminal/Lunatic trying to mislead about Player 6. However, without more information, it's hard to determine their role with certainty.\n\n5. **Player 5 says Player 4 is not the criminal.** This statement doesn't provide direct insight into Player 5's role but suggests they are not accusing Player 4, which could imply they are either telling the truth (if an Investigator) or not providing misleading information about Player 4 (could be any role).\n\n6. **Player 6 says Player 2 is the criminal.** Given that I know Player 6 is not the criminal from my own statement, this accusation could be truthful (if Player 6 is an Investigator or coincidentally correct if another role) or false (if Player 6 is the Rumormonger, Lunatic, or even the Criminal trying to deflect).\n\nGiven these statements, the most direct accusation of a criminal comes from Player 6 against Player 2, and Player 3's false accusation against me (Player 1). Since I know I'm not the criminal, and based on the information provided:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 2.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

Since I'm told I'm the Criminal, my statement could be a lie or the truth, but as a Criminal, I might try to mislead.\n- **Player 2** says Player 5 is not the criminal.

Similar to Player 4's statement, if Player 6 is an Investigator, this would confirm I'm not the Criminal, which again contradicts my given role.\n\nConsidering my role is given as the Criminal, but Players 4 and 6 claim I am not the Criminal, and assuming they could be Investigators (since Investigators always tell the truth), there seems to be a discrepancy. However, I must remember that I've been told I am the Criminal, which might not necessarily be true given the nature of the game (considering the roles of Lunatics and the potential for misinformation).\n\n**Analysis for Round 1:**\n\nGiven the information and the fact that I've been told I'm the Criminal, but without concrete evidence to confirm or deny my role or the roles of others, it's challenging to make a definitive judgment. The statements from Players 4 and 6 suggest I might not be the Criminal, which could imply that I'm actually a Lunatic (told I'm the Criminal but not actually the Criminal).

As I am told I am the Criminal, this statement could be a truth or a lie, but it's aimed at misleading.\n- **Player 2** says Player 3 is not the criminal.

This statement is false because I know I am an Investigator.\n6. **Player 6** says Player 2 is not the criminal.\n\nFrom the statements:\n- My statement about Player 3 being the criminal contradicts my previous statement. As an Investigator, I should provide consistent truthful information, which suggests a mistake in my analysis or a need for reevaluation based on Round 1's information.\n- Player 5 accusing me of being the criminal is a false statement, indicating Player 5 could be the Criminal, Rumormonger, or Lunatic.\n- Players 2 and 4 both accuse Player 5, which could suggest that Player 5 is indeed the criminal, or it could be a coincidence.\n\nGiven the inconsistency in my statements and the rules of the game, it seems there was an error in my Round 2 statement, as it contradicts my initial truth as an Investigator. However, the majority of the information points towards Player 5 being accused by multiple players, and since Player 5 falsely accused me, it increases the likelihood of Player 5 being the Criminal.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 5.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

This leaves Players 2 and 3 as potential candidates for the criminal, considering their statements and the dynamics of the game.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 2.\nMy Role Is Investigator."
