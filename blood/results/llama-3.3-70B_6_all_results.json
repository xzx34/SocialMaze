Player 4's previous accusation towards me (a known Investigator) raised suspicions about their role.\n2. **Player 2 says Player 4 is not the criminal.** Given my previous suspicions towards Player 2 as the potential Criminal, their defense of Player 4 could be an attempt to mislead or protect themselves if they are indeed the Criminal.\n3. **Player 3 says Player 5 is not the criminal.** This statement's reliability depends on Player 3's role.

If Player 3 is the Rumormonger or Lunatic, the statement's truthfulness is uncertain.\n4. **Player 4 says Player 3 is the criminal.** This accusation against Player 3, combined with Player 4's previous false accusation against me, suggests that Player 4 might be attempting to deflect or deceive, potentially indicating a non-Investigator role.\n5. **Player 5 says Player 4 is not the criminal.** This statement supports Player 2's claim and could indicate that Player 5 is either truthful about Player 4's innocence or is also involved in a deception strategy.\n6. **Player 6 says Player 5 is not the criminal.** Similar to previous statements about Player 5, this confirms what we would expect if Player 5 is not the Criminal, but without knowing Player 6's role, the reliability of this statement is uncertain.\n\nConsidering all rounds, the dynamic has shifted significantly, with Player 4 becoming a focal point of suspicion in Round 3. My change in accusation from Player 2 to Player 4 is based on the cumulative evidence and the behavior of players across the rounds. Player 4's accusation against me, a known Investigator, was a critical factor in this reassessment, as it suggested deceitful behavior. The defense of Player 4 by Player 2 and Player 5, despite previous inconsistencies and potential deceptions, further complicates the analysis but does not negate the suspicion towards Player 4 based on their actions.\n\n**Final Judgment after Round 3:**\nFinal Criminal Is Player 4.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

If Player 2 is an Investigator, then Player 4 is indeed not the criminal. If Player 2 is not an Investigator, the statement's truthfulness is uncertain.\n\n3. **Player 3 says Player 6 is not the criminal.** Similar to Player 2's statement, this could be true if Player 3 is an Investigator or false/true if they are not, depending on their actual role.\n\n4. **Player 4 says Player 5 is the criminal.** This could be a genuine accusation if Player 4 is an Investigator, a false lead if Player 4 is the Rumormonger or the Lunatic, or an attempt to mislead if Player 4 is the Criminal, which seems less likely given the direct accusations towards them.\n\n5. **Player 5 says Player 4 is not the criminal.** Again, the truthfulness depends on Player 5's role.

If Player 4 is consistent in accusing Player 5, it could indicate that Player 4 believes this to be true (possibly as a Rumormonger or genuinely as an Investigator) or is trying to mislead as the Lunatic or Criminal (less likely since I am the Criminal).\n\n5. **Player 5 says Player 6 is the criminal.** A new accusation. Without knowing Player 5's role, it's uncertain if this is a genuine accusation or an attempt to deflect.\n\n6. **Player 6 says Player 3 is the criminal.** This accusation suggests that Player 6 might be trying to find the criminal or mislead others.

Player 4 could be the Criminal, Lunatic, or Rumormonger.\n- **Player 5** says Player 4 is not the criminal. Given that I've already stated Player 5 is not the criminal and I'm truthful, if Player 5 were also an Investigator, this would be a truthful statement. However, without more information, we cannot confirm Player 5's role solely based on this.\n- **Player 6** says Player 3 is not the criminal. This statement's truthfulness depends on Player 6's role.\n\nFrom Round 1, we can deduce the following:\n\n- I am certain of my role as an **Investigator** because I was told so and my statements will reflect truthful information about others' roles relative to being the Criminal.\n- **Player 4**'s statement about me being the criminal is false, which means Player 4 is not an Investigator. This makes Player 4 a potential candidate for being the Criminal, given the false accusation.\n\nHowever, with only one round of statements, it's challenging to definitively identify the Criminal or the roles of all other players. We need more information to accurately deduce who the Criminal is and the roles of the other players.\n\n**Final Judgment:**\n**Final Criminal Is Player:** Unknown\n**My Role Is:** Investigator"

So, my role remains as told: **Investigator**.\n  \n- **Potential Criminal:** Since I accused Player 5, and considering the potential for deception from other roles, it's crucial to note that only Investigators provide consistently truthful information. Players 4 and 6's statements suggesting Player 5 is not the criminal could indicate they are either telling the truth (in which case they might be Investigators or genuinely mistaken) or lying (in which case they could be the Criminal, Rumormonger, or Lunatic).\n\nHowever, without more information or a clear pattern of deception that can be traced back to a specific role, it's challenging to conclusively identify the criminal based solely on Round 1 statements.

It could be a truthful accusation if Player 4 is an Investigator or a false one if Player 4 is not.\n5. **Player 5 says Player 2 is not the criminal.** This supports previous statements about Player 2's innocence but does not confirm it without knowing Player 5's role.\n6. **Player 6 says Player 3 is not the criminal.** This statement could be true if Player 6 is an Investigator or false if not.\n\n**Combining All Rounds' Analysis:**\n- The consistent theme across rounds is the doubt cast on Player 2 being the criminal, with multiple players (including myself in Rounds 2 and 3) stating Player 2 is not the criminal.\n- The statements about me (Player 1) being or not being the criminal are conflicting. I was told I am the Criminal, but Players 2 and 3 have stated I am not the criminal in their statements.\n- The accusations against other players (like Player 4 by Player 3 in Round 3) introduce new possibilities but do not conclusively identify the criminal.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nGiven the information and the conflicting statements, it's challenging to definitively conclude who the criminal is based solely on the statements provided.

Again, this could be true if Player 3 is an Investigator or misleading if they are not.\n\n4. **Player 4's Statement**: Player 4 says Player 3 is the criminal. This could be a truthful statement from an Investigator or a false claim from another role.\n\n5. **Player 5's Statement**: Player 5 says Player 6 is not the criminal. This statement's truthfulness depends on Player 5's role.\n\n6. **Player 6's Statement**: Player 6 claims Player 1 is not the criminal. Given that I am told I am the Criminal, if Player 6 is an Investigator, this statement would be false, which contradicts the Investigator's role of always telling the truth. Therefore, if Player 6 were an Investigator, they would not say this, suggesting Player 6 might not be an Investigator or is trying to deceive.\n\nGiven these statements and considering my own role as potentially the Criminal (as I've been told), let's analyze the possibilities:\n\n- **Investigator Statements**: Should be consistently truthful. Player 2 and Player 3's statements could be from Investigators, but without more information, it's hard to confirm.\n  \n- **Criminal Statement**: I, as Player 1, claimed Player 5 is the criminal, which could be a deception.\n\n- **Lunatic and Rumormonger**: These roles can provide false information. Player 6's statement about me not being the criminal is interesting because if they were an Investigator, this would be a lie, which Investigators cannot tell.\n\nAt this point, it's challenging to determine the roles of all players with certainty, especially given the potential for deception from non-Investigator roles. However, we can make some educated guesses:\n\n- **Player 6's statement** about me not being the criminal is suspicious because, as the game dictates, if Player 6 were indeed an Investigator, they would know I am the criminal (given I've been told I am) and thus would not say I am not. This suggests Player 6 might be attempting to deceive, possibly indicating they are not an Investigator.\n\nGiven the information and the analysis above, my judgment after Round 1 is:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal.\n\nThis judgment is based on the initial information provided to me as Player 1, stating I am the Criminal, and the analysis of the statements from the other players, which do not provide sufficient evidence to contradict my initial role assignment confidently."

This statement could indicate that Player 4 is indeed the criminal, but it contradicts my previous statement about Player 5. This contradiction could suggest that either my initial understanding was incorrect, or there's a complex dynamic at play that requires further analysis.\n\n2. **Player 2 says Player 1 is the criminal.** Since I know I am an Investigator and not the criminal, this statement is false. Given that Player 2's statement is false, Player 2 cannot be an Investigator, suggesting that Player 2 might be either the Rumormonger, the Lunatic, or the Criminal.\n\n3. **Player 3 says Player 6 is the criminal.** The truthfulness of this statement depends on Player 3's role. If Player 3 is an Investigator, then Player 6 could indeed be the criminal.\n\n4. **Player 4 says Player 6 is the criminal.** Similar to Player 3's statement, if Player 4 is an Investigator, then this statement could be true. However, my statement in Round 2 suggests that Player 4 might be the criminal, which would make this statement potentially false if coming from the criminal.\n\n5. **Player 5 says Player 4 is not the criminal.** Given my statement in Round 2 that Player 4 is the criminal, if Player 5 is an Investigator, this would mean Player 5 contradicts me, which is not possible if we are both Investigators. Thus, either Player 5 or I could be in a role that allows for false or misleading statements, or one of us has incorrect information.\n\n6. **Player 6 says Player 3 is the criminal.** This statement's truthfulness also depends on Player 6's role. If Player 6 is the Lunatic or the Criminal, this statement could be false. If Player 6 is not the criminal but another role, this could be true or false.\n\n**Analysis and Observations:**\n\n- The statement from Player 2 accusing me of being the criminal is a significant indicator that Player 2 is not an Investigator, as I am certain of my role as an Investigator.\n- The consistency between Players 3 and 4's statements about Player 6 being the criminal could suggest that either both are Investigators telling the truth, or there's a coordinated effort to mislead, which seems less likely given the roles' dynamics.\n- My own statements have shifted from accusing Player 5 to accusing Player 4, which could indicate a change in my understanding based on new information or an attempt to adapt to the game's progression.\n\n**Conclusion After Round 2:**\n\nConsidering the new information and the dynamics at play, my analysis suggests that the situation is complex, with multiple potential interpretations. However, based on the information provided and my role as an Investigator, I must reassess my previous conclusion.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 4.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

If Player 3 is an Investigator, this could indicate that Player 4 is indeed not the criminal.

This could be true or false depending on Player 2's role.\n3. **Player 3** says Player 4 is not the criminal.

The truth of this statement also depends on Player 6's role.\n\nFrom the statements, we can observe the following:\n\n- Players 2 and 6 both accuse Player 4 of being the criminal, while Player 3 defends Player 4. Given that I am an Investigator and my statements are always truthful, and I said Player 5 is not the criminal, we cannot yet conclude the criminal's identity based solely on Round 1 statements.\n- Since I know I am an Investigator, my role is confirmed as Investigator.\n\nHowever, without more information or patterns from subsequent rounds, identifying the criminal with certainty is challenging based solely on Round 1 statements. But we can start to form hypotheses:\n\n- If Player 2 is telling the truth, then Player 4 could be the criminal. However, this would mean Player 3 is either a Rumormonger or a Lunatic providing false information.\n- Player 5 accusing Player 2 of being the criminal could imply that Player 5 might be trying to deflect or is genuinely mistaken, depending on their role.\n\nGiven the information from Round 1 and my role as an Investigator, I must make an educated guess about the criminal's identity based on the patterns and potential roles of other players. However, it's crucial to note that with only one round of statements, the analysis is somewhat speculative.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 4.

Given that I believe I am the Criminal, my statement could be either truthful or false, as Criminals can lie.\n\n2. **Player 2's Statement:** Player 2 says Player 3 is not the criminal. If Player 2 is an Investigator, this statement would be true. However, without more information, it's difficult to determine Player 2's role based on this statement alone.\n\n3. **Player 3's Statement:** Player 3 also says Player 2 is not the criminal, supporting Player 2's statement about themselves indirectly. This could suggest that Player 3 is also an Investigator, but again, it's early to conclude.\n\n4. **Player 4's Statement:** Player 4 says I (Player 1) am the criminal. Given that I am told I am the Criminal, if Player 4 is an Investigator, their statement would be true.\n\n5. **Player 5's Statement:** Player 5 claims Player 2 is the criminal. This contradicts the statements made by Players 2 and 3. If Player 5 is a Rumormonger or the Lunatic, they might make false accusations. However, it's also possible for Player 5 to be the Criminal trying to deflect.\n\n6. **Player 6's Statement:** Player 6 says Player 5 is not the criminal. This could be a truthful statement if Player 6 is an Investigator or a false statement if they are not.\n\nGiven these statements and considering my role as told to me (Criminal), I notice that Player 4 directly accuses me of being the Criminal, which aligns with what I've been told. However, I must consider the possibility that I might not actually be the Criminal, given the nature of the game and the roles of Lunatics and Rumormongers who believe they are something they are not.\n\n**Final Judgment after Round 1:**\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal.\n\nThis judgment is based on the information provided to me before the game and the accusation by Player 4, which directly points to me as the Criminal. However, the true nature of the game and the roles of other players could reveal more information in subsequent rounds that might challenge this initial assessment."

As an Investigator, my statement is truthful.\n2. **Player 2** says Player 5 is not the criminal. This aligns with my statement, but since Player 2's role is unknown, this statement could be true or false.\n3. **Player 3** says Player 4 is the criminal. This is a direct accusation and needs to be considered alongside other statements.\n4. **Player 4** says Player 2 is not the criminal. This statement, like others, depends on Player 4's role for its truthfulness.\n5. **Player 5** says Player 1 is the criminal. This is a significant statement because, as an Investigator, I know I am not the criminal. This means Player 5 is either a Lunatic (believing they are the Criminal and making potentially false statements) or a Rumormonger (believing they are an Investigator but providing incorrect information).\n6. **Player 6** says Player 3 is not the criminal. This statement's truthfulness depends on Player 6's role.\n\nFrom Round 1, I concluded that Player 2 is not the criminal based on my own statement. In Round 2, Player 4 also says Player 2 is not the criminal, which aligns with my earlier conclusion.\n\nThe accusation by Player 5 against me (Player 1) is false, as I am an Investigator and not the criminal. This indicates that Player 5 could be a Lunatic or a Rumormonger. However, since Lunatics believe they are the Criminal and might make truthful or false statements, and given that I've already stated Player 5 is not the criminal (as an Investigator), it's more likely that Player 5's statement is an error, potentially marking them as a Rumormonger.\n\nGiven the information, it's still challenging to pinpoint the criminal with absolute certainty without more consistent accusations or defenses from players across both rounds. However, the fact that Player 5 falsely accused me suggests they might not be an Investigator, and their role could be either a Rumormonger or a Lunatic, but since I've stated they are not the criminal, it leans more towards a Rumormonger if they were making a mistaken claim as someone who believes they are an Investigator.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player Unknown.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

However, the game's setup and my initial information suggest that I should consider the possibility that my role is indeed as stated, despite the uncertainty introduced by the statements.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nGiven the information from all rounds and considering the potential for deception, the most direct accusation against me (by Player 6 in Round 2) stands out. This, combined with the evolving statements and the game's mechanics, leads to a conclusion that must consider both the statements and the roles' potential for deception.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

Given that I am told I am the Criminal, my statement about Player 4 could be either true or false, as Criminals can provide misleading information.\n\n2. **Player 2** says Player 4 is not the criminal. This statement could be true if Player 2 is an Investigator or potentially false if they are not.\n\n3. **Player 3** says Player 6 is the criminal. If Player 3 is an Investigator, this statement would be true. However, if they are not, it could be false.\n\n4. **Player 4** says Player 3 is the criminal. Similar to the reasoning for Player 3, this could be true if Player 4 is an Investigator or false otherwise.\n\n5. **Player 5** says Player 2 is not the criminal. Again, this could be true or false depending on Player 5's role.\n\n6. **Player 6** says Player 1 is the criminal. Given that I am told I am the Criminal, and considering Player 6's statement, if Player 6 were an Investigator, this would confirm my role as the Criminal. However, since Lunatics believe they are Criminals and can make statements that may be truthful or false, and Rumormongers believe they are Investigators but can provide incorrect information, we cannot immediately conclude Player 6's role or the truth of their statement without more analysis.\n\nConsidering the roles and the information provided:\n- ** Investigators** always tell the truth about who is or isn't the Criminal.\n- **Rumormongers** and **Lunatics** can provide false information, and their statements may not align with the actual roles or the truth about the Criminal.\n\nFrom the statements, we notice that:\n- Player 1 and Player 2 both say Player 4 is not the Criminal, which could indicate they are telling the truth if they are Investigators, or it could be a coincidence.\n- Player 3 accuses Player 6, and Player 4 accuses Player 3, which could indicate one of them might be the Criminal if the other is an Investigator, but it's also possible for this to be misleading.\n- Player 5 says Player 2 is not the Criminal, which supports Player 2's potential to be an Investigator but does not confirm it.\n- Player 6's accusation towards me (Player 1) is interesting because, given my supposed role as the Criminal, if Player 6 were indeed an Investigator, this would align with the game's rules. However, without knowing Player 6's actual role, we cannot be certain.\n\n**Given the information from Round 1**, it's challenging to conclusively determine the roles of all players or even confirm my own role with absolute certainty because the statements can be misleading or truthful based on the roles. However, considering that I am told I am the Criminal and Player 6 directly accuses me, which aligns with what would be expected if Player 6 were an Investigator (since they would truthfully identify the Criminal), this provides a potential clue but does not conclusively prove anything without further information.\n\n**Final Judgment after Round 1:**\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

This aligns with Player 2's statement in Round 1, suggesting consistency but not necessarily truth.\n\n3. **Player 3** says Player 6 is the criminal. This is the same statement as in Round 1, indicating either a genuine belief (if an Investigator) or a false accusation (if not).\n\n4. **Player 4** says Player 3 is not the criminal. This statement differs from Round 1, where Player 4 accused Player 3 of being the criminal. The change could indicate that Player 4 is providing false or misleading information, potentially marking them as a Rumormonger or Lunatic, but it's also possible for an Investigator to have made a mistake in their deduction or for a Criminal/Lunatic to occasionally tell the truth.\n\n5. **Player 5** says Player 6 is not the criminal. This statement contrasts with Player 3's accusation towards Player 6 and could indicate that Player 5 might be a Rumormonger (believing they are an Investigator but providing potentially false information).\n\n6. **Player 6** says Player 1 is the criminal. This statement, consistent across both rounds, suggests that if Player 6 is indeed an Investigator, they are correctly identifying me as the Criminal. However, without knowing Player 6's role for certain, this could also be a false accusation from a Lunatic or a misinformed statement from a Rumormonger.\n\n**Observations and Deductions:**\n\n- The consistency of statements from Players 1, 2, and 3 across both rounds might suggest they are sticking to their initial beliefs or roles, but doesn't necessarily validate their claims.\n- Player 4's change in statement could indicate a role that allows for or encourages false or changing information, such as a Rumormonger or Lunatic.\n- Player 5's statement contradicts Player 3's, which could mean one of them is not an Investigator, or both are providing false information.\n- Player 6's consistent accusation towards me (Player 1) is notable, especially considering I am told I am the Criminal. If Player 6 is an Investigator, this would confirm my role. However, the game's nature means this isn't conclusive without further analysis.\n\n**Given the information from Round 2**, while there are some consistent statements and some changes, the roles and the actual identity of the Criminal are still not definitively clear.

This accusation is new and contrasts with the majority of statements about Player 2 from other rounds. If Player 4 is an Investigator, this would be a significant revelation. However, given the potential for Rumormongers or Lunatics to make false accusations, this statement alone doesn't confirm Player 2's role.\n\n5. **Player 5** says Player 3 is not the criminal. This statement supports the claims made by Players 1 and 2, suggesting that if any of these players are Investigators, they believe in Player 3's innocence.\n\n6. **Player 6** says Player 2 is not the criminal. This statement, combined with Player 6's consistent accusations towards me (Player 1) in the previous rounds, suggests that if Player 6 is an Investigator, they are trying to clarify the situation by also ruling out Player 2 as the Criminal.\n\n**Observations and Deductions:**\n\n- The majority of players (1, 2, 5) state that Player 3 is not the criminal, which could indicate a genuine belief in Player 3's innocence or a coordinated effort to mislead.\n- Player 3's statement that I (Player 1) am not the criminal contradicts my initial information and could suggest that Player 3 is not an Investigator.\n- Player 4's accusation towards Player 2 is a significant departure from previous statements and could indicate that Player 4 is trying to mislead or is genuinely mistaken about Player 2's role.\n- Player 6's consistent behavior, accusing me in the first two rounds and now also stating that Player 2 is not the criminal, could suggest that Player 6 is indeed an Investigator trying to uncover the truth.\n\n**Given the information from Round 3**, while there are still inconsistencies and potential for deception, the accumulation of statements across all rounds suggests that the truth about the Criminal's identity and the roles of other players is complex and open to interpretation.

This consensus suggests that Player 3 is likely not the criminal, as it would be unlikely for multiple players, including potential Investigators and other roles, to coincidentally or falsely clear the same player unless they are indeed telling the truth.\n\n2. **Consistent statements about Player 6**: Players 3, 4, and previously in Rounds 1 and 2, Players 4, 5, and 6 themselves, have said Player 6 is not the criminal. This consistent clearing of Player 6 across multiple rounds and by different players suggests that Player 6 is likely not the criminal.\n\n3. **My role and statements**: As an Investigator, my statements should be truthful. Initially, I pointed to Player 4 as the criminal, then retracted, and now I've made a statement about Player 3 not being the criminal. The retraction and change in target could indicate a process of deduction based on new information or a realization of a previous mistake.\n\nGiven the consensus and the consistent statements across rounds, the most likely scenario is that the criminal is not among the players consistently cleared by multiple individuals. Since Players 3 and 6 have been consistently cleared, and considering my initial statement and subsequent retraction, it's essential to focus on the remaining players.\n\nHowever, without direct accusations or more specific information about the roles and behaviors of Players 2, 4, and 5, pinpointing the exact criminal based solely on the statements provided becomes speculative. But, considering the game's dynamics and the need to make an informed judgment, we should look for inconsistencies or patterns that might have emerged across the rounds.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 2.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

Player 3's accusation against Player 2 is contradicted by multiple players (including myself, an Investigator), which might suggest that Player 3 could be the Lunatic or possibly the Criminal trying to mislead.

However, the accusations against me (Player 1) by Player 5 and the consistent accusation against Player 6 by Player 3 introduce complexity.\n\nGiven that I have been told I am the Criminal and considering the statements, especially the ones that directly address my role or provide consistent accusations:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."
