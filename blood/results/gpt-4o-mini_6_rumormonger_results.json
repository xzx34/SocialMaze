(This could be true or false; Player 6's role is uncertain based on previous rounds).\n\nNow, let's summarize the implications:\n\n- My statement that Player 3 is the criminal suggests that I have shifted my suspicion based on the earlier rounds.\n- Player 2, Player 3, and Player 4 are all defending Player 6, which could indicate that Player 6 is indeed the Criminal, as they are all possibly trying to protect them.\n- Player 5\u2019s statement about Player 2 adds another layer of complexity, but without further context, it\u2019s difficult to interpret.\n- Since I know I am an Investigator and must provide truthful information, I must reassess my previous conclusion about Player 6.\n\nConsidering the pattern of statements, it appears that Player 6 has consistently been defended by multiple players (Players 2, 3, and 4), which raises suspicion about their role. However, I now suspect Player 3 based on my statement.\n\nGiven the contradictions and the defense surrounding Player 6, along with my earlier statement about Player 3, I will conclude that Player 3 seems to be the most likely suspect now.\n\nTherefore, my final judgment is as follows:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 3.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

Players 3 and 4 are likely Investigators as they are consistently providing information that aligns with the truth.\n\nGiven that you are the criminal, Player 6 is not the criminal based on the consensus from Players 3 and 4.\n\n**Final Judgment**:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

Therefore, Player 4's statement is likely false.\n- If Player 4 is wrong, then Player 2 is not the criminal, making Player 5's statement true.\n- Player 3 saying Player 2 is not the criminal aligns with Players 2 and 5.\n- Player 6's statement about Player 3 not being the criminal does not provide definitive information about Player 3's role but suggests that Player 6 might be truthful.\n\nSo far, we have:\n- Player 1 is the confirmed Criminal.\n- Player 2 is likely not the criminal based on the majority of statements.\n- Player 4 is likely misinformed or lying about Player 2 being the criminal.\n\nTaking this into account, we cannot definitively identify the Criminal among Players 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 without further rounds of statements.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

My statement about Player 4 not being the criminal stands if Player 4 is indeed not the criminal.\n- Player 2's statement supports my role as Investigator.\n- Player 3's statement about Player 2 not being the criminal contradicts Player 5's claim, creating confusion about Player 2's role.\n- Player 4's statement about Player 5 being the criminal contradicts Player 5's claim that Player 2 is the criminal.\n- Player 5's statement about Player 2 could indicate that Player 5 is trying to deflect suspicion away from themselves, especially since they are being accused by Player 4.\n- Player 6's statement about Player 3 does not provide a definitive conclusion regarding Player 3's role.\n\nSo, let's summarize the potential roles:\n- If I maintain that Player 3 is the criminal (from prior reasoning), then Player 6's statement about Player 3 not being the criminal would be false.\n- If Player 4 accuses Player 5, and Player 5 accuses Player 2, it creates a circular blame where Player 5 and Player 4 could both be trying to protect themselves.\n\nSince I have previously identified Player 3 as the criminal and the contradictions in this round do not provide sufficient evidence to change my judgment, I will maintain my conclusion.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 3.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

This means Player 4 is likely not an Investigator, as they would provide truthful information. Therefore, Player 4 could be the Rumormonger or the Lunatic.\n\nGiven that all other players (1, 2, 3, 5, and 6) have made statements that align with my role as Investigator and the information gathered in previous rounds, I can confidently conclude:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 6.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

Therefore, Player 4 is not the criminal.\n\nNow, we can evaluate the remaining statements:\n\n- Player 2 claims Player 6 is the criminal, while Player 6 claims Player 2 is not the criminal. This creates a conflict.\n- Player 3 claims Player 2 is the criminal, which contradicts Player 6's statement that Player 2 is not the criminal. \n- Player 4 claims Player 5 is not the criminal, and Player 5 claims Player 3 is not the criminal. These statements are also in conflict with the potential criminal claims.\n\nFrom this, we can deduce that:\n- Since Player 4 is not the criminal (your truthful statement), we can focus on the other players.\n- If Player 2 is the criminal, then Player 6's statement about Player 2 not being the criminal would be false.\n- If Player 3 is the criminal, then Player 2's statement about Player 6 being the criminal would also be false.\n- If Player 5 is the criminal, then Player 4's statement about Player 5 not being the criminal would also be false.\n\nThis leads to the understanding that there is a conflict between Players 2 and 3, and one of them must be the criminal. Players 5 and 6 are also potential candidates, but Player 4's statement exonerates Player 5.\n\nThus, we can summarize the likely scenario based on the statements:\n- Player 2 and Player 3 are in conflict, and one of them is likely the criminal.\n- Players 4 and 5 are not the criminals based on your truthful statement and Player 4's statement.\n\nSince there are 4 Investigators, the presence of conflicting statements indicates that at least one of Player 2 or Player 3 must be the Criminal.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 2 (based on the conflicts).\nMy Role Is Investigator."

However, no new evidence contradicts the conclusion from the first round.\n\nTo summarize:\n- Player 1's statement confirms Player 6 is not the criminal.\n- Player 2's statement about Player 3 being the criminal aligns with previous information but could be misleading.\n- Player 3's statement aligns with your understanding that you are not the criminal.\n- Player 4 and Player 5's statements do not provide conflicting information against previous deductions.\n\nGiven that the only clear and consistent identification of the criminal is Player 3 from Round 1, I will maintain that judgment.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 3.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

Since I know Player 1's statement is true, and Player 6's statement is false, Player 5 may be the criminal, but we must verify with further rounds.\n- Player 5 claims Player 2 is not the criminal, which could be an attempt to deflect suspicion if Player 5 is indeed the criminal.\n- Player 6's accusation against me is false, confirming my role as Investigator.\n\nSince there is a consensus among Players 2, 3, and 4 about Player 5 being the criminal, and given that Player 1's statement is true (Player 4 is not the criminal), it leans towards Player 5 being the criminal.\n\nHowever, we need to keep in mind that Players 2, 3, and 4 could potentially include a Rumormonger or a Criminal among them.\n\nAt this point, based on the consensus and the truthful nature of my statement, I conclude:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 5.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

(This statement is questionable, as Player 6 could be lying or mistaken.)\n\nFrom the statements:\n\n- My statement about Player 6 not being the criminal is true.\n- Players 2 and 4 also say Player 6 is not the criminal. This could potentially indicate that they might also be Investigators or at least not the Criminal.\n- Player 3's statement confirms my role as an Investigator, which is consistent and truthful.\n- Player 5 claims that Player 6 is the criminal, which contradicts the majority's claim (Players 1, 2, 3, and 4) that Player 6 is not the criminal.\n- Player 6 accuses Player 3 of being the criminal, which is a potential deflection tactic if Player 6 is indeed the Criminal or might be incorrect if they are a Rumormonger or Lunatic.\n\nBased on this analysis, the majority consensus indicates that Player 6 is not the criminal. Player 5's claim about Player 6 being the criminal seems like an attempt to mislead.\n\nThus, Player 6 is likely not the criminal based on the information from myself and Players 2, 3, and 4.\n\nGiven the conflicting statements and the likelihood of Player 5 trying to mislead, I now suspect Player 5 could be the criminal, as their statement contradicts the majority.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 5.\nMy Role Is Investigator."
