If Player 6 is an Investigator, this statement is true, meaning Player 5 is not the criminal. This is consistent with Player 3's statement.\n\nFrom these observations:\n\n- Players 3, 4, and 6 all agree that Player 5 is not the criminal.\n- Player 2 claims Player 1 is the criminal, but Player 5 (potential Investigator) denies Player 2 is the criminal.\n- Player 1 (me), being told I am the Criminal, might not actually be the criminal due to the game's mechanics.\n\nConsidering these points, if most of the consistent statements are true, Player 5 is not the criminal.

My statement is that Player 6 is the criminal. If I am the actual Criminal, my statement could be true or false. If I am the Lunatic, I might believe myself to be the Criminal and thus my statement could be true or false.\n\n- **Player 2**: Claims that Player 1 is the criminal.

Player 2 may be lying.\n- Players 3, 4, 5, and 6 all claimed others are not the criminal, fitting Investigator behavior or attempts by the Criminal or Lunatic to appear trustworthy.\n\nGiven the contradictions and the fact that Players 5 and 6 are both supporting me:\n\n- Player 2 looks suspicious for directly accusing another player when no other accusations are corroborated.\n- Players 3 and 4's statements don't directly conflict with my knowledge, and they align with each other by not accusing anyone.\n  \nThus, Player 2 is a likely candidate for the Criminal based on their direct accusation without support from others, and the fact that Player 6 is confirmed not to be the Criminal by me and others.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 2.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

However, Player 2 directly opposed me in Round 2 and has consistently been implicated by me and Player 6.\n\n2. **Players 3, 4, and 5**: These players form a block supporting each other, with Player 3 directly accusing me, which is incorrect. This collective support without clear reason suggests a mix of confusion and misinformation, likely involving the Rumormonger and/or Lunatic.\n\n3. **Player 6**: Continues to align with my statements by identifying Player 2 as the criminal, which is consistent with my deduction.\n\nGiven the consistent false accusations by Player 2 against me and the supportive statements from Player 6, Player 2 remains the most likely candidate for the Criminal.

The inconsistency in Player 5\u2019s statements might suggest Player 5 is not an Investigator.\n\n6. **Player 6**: Claims Player 1 is not the Criminal, which aligns with my role as an Investigator. This provides some consistency, but Player 6's previous statements have been supportive of potentially misleading statements, suggesting possible confusion or deception.\n\nFrom the consistent information and conflicting statements:\n- Player 4 is not the Criminal (confirmed by me, Player 1, and supported by Player 3).\n- Player 2 is not the Criminal (supported by Player 4 and my own statement).\n\nGiven the inconsistency from Player 5 and the false claim from Player 3 about me, combined with the support for Player 3's innocence by Player 6, the deduction points towards Player 5 as the most likely to be the Criminal.\n\nPlayer 3's false claim about me, and Player 5's inconsistent accusations, suggest Player 5 is the Criminal, with Player 3 potentially being the Lunatic due to the illogical accusation against me.\n\nFinal Judgment after Round 3:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 5.\nMy Role Is Investigator. \n\nThis conclusion aligns with the analysis that Player 5's behavior has been the most inconsistent with the truth, combined with Player 3's potentially erratic behavior indicative of a Lunatic's confused role."

This means my statement doesn't necessarily help elucidate the situation.\n\n2. **Player 2**: Claims Player 4 is not the criminal.

Otherwise, this could be a deceptive statement if Player 3 is a Criminal or Lunatic.\n\n4. **Player 4**: Claims Player 5 is not the criminal.

This is consistent with previous rounds where Player 3 has avoided accusing others as criminals.\n\n4. **Player 4**: Says Player 3 is not the criminal. A mutual non-accusation between Player 3 and Player 4, which suggests they might both be Investigators or one is misleading.\n\n5. **Player 5**: Says Player 4 is not the criminal. Consistently stating others are not criminals, suggesting truthfulness if an Investigator or misleading if a Rumormonger/Lunatic.\n\n6. **Player 6**: Says Player 4 is not the criminal. This aligns with Player 5's statement, suggesting collaboration or a shared belief.\n\nAnalysis:\n- Player 4 is heavily supported by Player 3, 5, and 6 as not being the Criminal. This suggests Player 4 is unlikely to be the Criminal.\n- Player 2 has consistently named players as non-criminals but is accused by Player 1 (me) and has conflicting dynamics with Player 4.\n- The consistent protection of certain players by others suggests a network of Investigators or a mix with a Rumormonger/Lunatic.\n\nGiven the consistency of accusations and non-accusations, the strongest conflict remains around Player 2 and Player 4, with Player 4 being consistently defended by others.\n\nFinal Judgment after Round 3:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 2.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

This could be true if Player 2 is also an Investigator, but if Player 2 is the Criminal, Rumormonger, or Lunatic, this statement could be misleading.\n\n3. **Player 3**: Claims Player 6 is not the criminal. If Player 3 were an Investigator, this would be true. However, if Player 3 is the Criminal, Rumormonger, or Lunatic, this statement could be false.\n\n4. **Player 4**: Claims Player 1 is not the criminal. This is true because I am indeed not the criminal. Player 4 could be an Investigator or possibly a non-Investigator role providing accidental truth.\n\n5. **Player 5**: Claims Player 3 is not the criminal. This aligns with my statement, suggesting Player 5 could be an Investigator or a non-Investigator providing truth.\n\n6. **Player 6**: Claims Player 4 is not the criminal. This is questionable because if Player 6 is the Criminal or a misleading role, they might be trying to divert suspicion.\n\nFrom this analysis, we have some observations:\n- Players 1, 4, and 5 suggest Player 3 is not the criminal.\n- Player 4 supports Player 1 as not the criminal, which is true.\n- Player 2 and Player 6 both claim Player 4 is not the criminal.\n\nGiven the potential for misleading statements from non-Investigator roles, it's difficult to make a definitive judgment after just one round. However, we can start forming suspicions.\n\nFinal Judgment after Round 1:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 6 (most suspicious based on the claim about Player 4 without corroboration, and potential misleading statement).\nMy Role Is Investigator."

If Player 2 is truthful, then Player 5 could be the Criminal.\n- **Player 3** has made conflicting statements, particularly claiming I am not the Criminal, which contradicts the narrative I am told. This suggests Player 3 might be confused or misled.\n- **Player 4** consistently supports Player 6's innocence, which suggests truthfulness.\n- **Player 5** consistently supports Player 4's innocence, which also suggests truthfulness or blending in.\n- **Player 6** supports my innocence, which is incorrect, indicating potential confusion or misdirection.\n\nGiven these observations, Player 3's conflicting statements lead me to suspect they might be misled (Lunatic) or the Rumormonger. However, the consistent accusations by Player 2 against Player 5 and the support for Player 4's innocence suggest that Player 2 might be an Investigator, making their claim about Player 5 potentially true.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 5.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

This repeated assurance suggests that these players are likely Investigators, making Player 2 less likely to be the criminal.\n- Player 5's claim that Player 3 is the criminal conflicts with the consistent assertions about Player 2, raising the possibility that Player 5 might be the Criminal or Lunatic.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nGiven the consistency in statements across rounds from Players 3, 4, and 6, Player 5's accusation against Player 3 seems unreliable. Since I am told that I am the Criminal, I will maintain my stated role but keep observing for any contradictions in further rounds.\n\n### Final Judgment after Round 2:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

This is consistent with my statement, which could imply Player 2 is also trying to mislead, or they could be a Rumormonger who incorrectly believes this.\n\n3. **Player 3**: Claims that Player 6 is not the criminal. If Player 3 is an Investigator, this statement is truthful. Otherwise, it might be misleading or incorrect.\n\n4. **Player 4**: Also claims that Player 6 is not the criminal. If truthful, this supports the notion that Player 6 is indeed not the criminal, possibly confirming Player 3 or 4 as Investigators.\n\n5. **Player 5**: Claims that Player 3 is not the criminal. If Player 5 is an Investigator, this statement is truthful. However, if misleading or incorrect, Player 5 might be trying to protect Player 3 or is mistaken.\n\n6. **Player 6**: Claims that Player 1 is the criminal. This aligns with the possibility of Player 6 being an Investigator, as I am told I am the Criminal. Alternatively, Player 6 could be a Lunatic or Rumormonger making a truthful or coincidentally correct statement.\n\nAnalyzing the overlap:\n- Players 3 and 4 agree that Player 6 is not the criminal. This consistency suggests they might both be Investigators.\n- Player 5's statement that Player 3 is not the criminal contradicts Player 2's and my claim, suggesting Player 5 might be an Investigator or a misled Rumormonger.\n- Player 6 saying I am the criminal is consistent with my role, indicating Player 6 could be an Investigator or another role making a truthful statement.\n\nConsidering this, the consistent claims about Player 6 not being the criminal and Player 3 being not the criminal might suggest that Player 3 is more likely to be an Investigator or truthful role, and Player 5 might be an Investigator or misleading role protecting Player 3.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

Therefore, let's make a preliminary judgment based on the first analysis.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 3.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

If Player 2 is an Investigator, this statement is true, which means Player 4 is not the criminal. If Player 2 is the Lunatic or the Criminal, this could be false.\n\n- Player 3 says Player 5 is the criminal.

If Player 3 is the Lunatic or Criminal, this could be misleading.\n\n- Player 4 says Player 3 is not the criminal. If Player 4 is an Investigator, this statement is true, suggesting Player 3 is not the criminal. If Player 4 is the Lunatic or Criminal, this could be misleading.\n\n- Player 5 says Player 6 is not the criminal.

If Player 5 is the Lunatic or Criminal, this could be misleading.\n\n- Player 6 says Player 1 is the criminal. If Player 6 is an Investigator, this statement is true, which aligns with what I was told. If Player 6 is the Lunatic or Criminal, this could be misleading.\n\nFrom both rounds, we have seen:\n\n- Player 2 has claimed both Player 5 and Player 4 are not criminals, suggesting if they are an Investigator, both are not criminals.\n- Player 3 has accused Player 1 (me) and Player 5 in different rounds, which might indicate confusion or a non-Investigator role.\n- Player 4 has been consistent in saying others are not criminals without accusing anyone.\n- Player 5 has consistently said Player 6 is not the criminal.\n- Player 6 has accused Player 1 (me) as the criminal, which aligns with what I was told.\n\nGiven the information:\n- Player 6's accusation that I am the criminal strengthens the possibility that Player 6 is an Investigator.\n- Player 5 and Player 6 have both been consistent about Player 6 not being the criminal, suggesting reliability in their statements if they are Investigators.\n\nBased on the consistency and the number of corroborations, let's update the judgment:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

This is a truthful statement.\n- **Player 2:** Claims Player 5 is the criminal.\n- **Player 3:** Claims Player 5 is the criminal.\n- **Player 4:** Claims Player 6 is not the criminal.\n- **Player 5:** Claims Player 2 is not the criminal.\n- **Player 6:** Claims Player 3 is not the criminal.\n\nFrom my perspective as an Investigator, my statement about Player 2 is truthful. Therefore, Player 2 is not the criminal. \n\nSince Player 5 also claims Player 2 is not the criminal, they could potentially be an Investigator, or they could be the Criminal or Lunatic making a truthful or misleading statement. More evidence is needed to determine Player 5's role.\n\nBoth Player 2 and Player 3 claim Player 5 is the criminal. If they were Investigators, then Player 5 would indeed be the criminal. However, at least one of them could be misled or lying (i.e., the Lunatic or Criminal).\n\nPlayer 4's statement that Player 6 is not the criminal could be truthful if they are an Investigator, or it could be false if they are the Criminal or Lunatic.\n\nPlayer 6 claims Player 3 is not the criminal. If Player 6 is truthful, then Player 3 is not the criminal, and therefore Player 2 could be lying or confused.\n\nAt this stage, the overlap suggests that Player 5 could be the criminal based on the consistency of accusations from Player 2 and Player 3. However, due to the potential misleading nature of statements from non-Investigators, more rounds are needed for further confirmation.\n\n**Final Judgment after Round 1:**\nFinal Criminal Is Player 5.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

Player 4's earlier accusation against Player 2 (which I know is false) suggests they might be the Lunatic or just misled, but they do not seem to be the Criminal based on current evidence.\n\n**Final Judgment after Round 3:**\nFinal Criminal Is Player 5.\nMy Role Is Investigator."
