Their statements are consistently truthful, suggesting that Players 2 and 4 are likely Investigators.\n\u2022 The rules require that exactly three players are genuine Investigators. With Players 2, 3, and 4 showing consistently truthful statements, they fill the Investigator roles.\n\u2022 In contrast, Players 5 and 6 have made statements that include false claims (e.g., in both rounds, Player 5 insisted that Player 1 is not the Criminal, even though I am Criminal), so they are not Investigators. Their roles must be one Rumormonger and one Lunatic. Their mixed (sometimes false, sometimes true) statements are expected from roles that misinterpret their role (Rumormonger believes they are Investigators) or from Lunatics (who believe they are Criminals) without a guarantee of truthfulness.\n\u2022 My own statements as Player 1 are unreliable by design. In Round 1 I falsely accused Player 3, and in Round 2 I falsely accused Player 6. This is consistent with my role as Criminal who may lie to confuse others.\n\nConclusion:\nAll evidence continues to point to me being the Criminal, and the consistently truthful statements from Players 2, 3, and 4 indicate they are genuine Investigators.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

Final Conclusion\nBased on all rounds and the requirement that investigators always tell the truth, the only role assignment that makes all investigator statements perfectly true is the one where the true Criminal is Player 2 and I (Player 1) am not the criminal but in fact the Lunatic (since I was told I was Criminal but that is what lunatics are told).\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 2.\nMy Role Is Lunatic."

Reviewing the round\u20101 statements:\n\u2003\u2022 Player 1 (me) said \u201cPlayer 3 is the criminal.\u201d (As Criminal I am free to say anything.)\n\u2003\u2022 Player 2 said \u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal.\u201d \u2013 If Player 2 were an Investigator this statement would have to be true, but since I\u2019m the Criminal the statement is false. Thus Player 2 cannot be an Investigator.\n\u2003\u2022 Player 3 said \u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal.\u201d \u2013 This is false if I\u2019m the criminal; so Player 3 is not an Investigator.\n\u2003\u2022 Player 4 said \u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal.\u201d \u2013 Same reasoning: this statement is false if I am Criminal, so Player 4 cannot be an Investigator.\n\u2003\u2022 Player 5 said \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d \u2013 This is true (since I am Criminal), which is consistent with an Investigator\u2019s responsibility.\n\u2003\u2022 Player 6 said \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d \u2013 This is also true, and fits the pattern for an Investigator as well.\n\n4. Based solely on Round 1:\n\u2003\u2013 The only players making statements consistent with being Investigators are Players 5 and 6.\n\u2003\u2013 Players 2, 3, and 4 made statements that are false given that I know I am the Criminal. Since only Investigators always tell the truth, these players must be either the Rumormonger or the Lunatic (both of whom can state things that are either true or false to mislead).\n\n5.

Thus, even though in Round 1 Player 6 appeared truthful, his Round 2 statement contradicts the known reality.\n  \nSince my instructions state that I know my role as Criminal, the only possibility for someone to be proclaimed the Criminal by an Investigator would be if they pointed to me.

We can be sure that Player 3 is not the criminal.\n\n2. Let\u2019s review the other statements:\n\u2003\u2022 Player 2: \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 Player 3: \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 Player 4: \u201cPlayer 1 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 Player 5: \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 Player 6: \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\n3. An immediate inconsistency appears with Player 2 and Player 6: one claims that Player 4 is criminal while the other claims the opposite. Since only Investigators always tell the truth, exactly one of these two conflicting statements (if coming from an Investigator) must be correct.\n\n4. Note that Player 4\u2019s statement \u201cPlayer 1 is the criminal\u201d is false because I know I am not criminal as an Investigator. Thus, Player 4 cannot be an Investigator and must be one of the non-investigator roles (Criminal, Rumormonger, or Lunatic).\n\n5. Now consider two possible scenarios:\n\n\u2003Scenario A:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Assume Player 2 is an Investigator. Then his statement \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal\u201d is true. That makes Player 4 the Criminal.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 As a result, Player 6\u2019s statement \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal\u201d is false. Then Player 6 must be a non-investigator (Rumormonger or Lunatic).\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 With Player 1 (me) as Investigator, we still need two more Investigators. Candidate Investigators here could be Player 3 (whose statement \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal\u201d would then be true) and perhaps Player 5 (whose statement \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal\u201d is factually correct since the criminal is Player 4). This would yield four \u201cInvestigator\u2010like\u201d statements, but we only have three true Investigators to assign. Thus there is tension in assigning roles consistently if too many of these players end up with Investigator-like behavior.\n\n\u2003Scenario B:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Instead, assume Player 6 is an Investigator. Then his statement \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal\u201d is true. Consequently, Player 4 cannot be the criminal.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 In this scenario, Player 2\u2019s statement \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal\u201d becomes false. That fits if Player 2 is the Criminal \u2013 criminals can lie arbitrarily.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 I (Player 1) am an Investigator, and we can assign the third Investigator role to Player 3 because his statement \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal\u201d would be true.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Then the three Investigators are Players 1, 3, and 6; and the three non-investigators are Players 2, 4, and 5. With exactly one Criminal needed, assigning that to Player 2 (the one whose accusation is false) is consistent; Players 4 and 5 would then be the Rumormonger and Lunatic in some order.\n\n6. Scenario B resolves the conflicts neatly:\n\u2003\u2013 Player 1 (Investigator) truthfully asserts that Player 3 is not criminal.\n\u2003\u2013 Player 3 (Investigator) truthfully asserts that Player 5 is not criminal.\n\u2003\u2013 Player 6 (Investigator) truthfully asserts that Player 4 is not criminal.\n\u2003\u2013 Player 2 (Criminal) falsely accuses Player 4.\n\u2003\u2013 Player 4 (non-investigator) falsely accuses Player 1.\n\u2003\u2013 Player 5 (non-investigator) states \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal\u201d (which is factually true although they are not obligated to be truthful).\n\n7. Based on this reasoning, the most consistent assignment from the Round 2 statements is:\n\u2003\u2013 Final Criminal: Player 2.\n\u2003\u2013 Investigators: Players 1, 3, and 6.\n\u2003\u2013 The remaining roles (Rumormonger and Lunatic) go to Players 4 and 5.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 2.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

In each round, I stated \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal\u201d (Rounds 1 and 2) and \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal\u201d (Round 3). Therefore, in every round the criminal cannot be Player 3 or Player 4.\n\nLet\u2019s summarize each round\u2019s statements with this in mind:\n\n\u2022 Round 1:\n\u2003\u2013 P1: \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal.\u201d (True, so P3 \u2260 criminal.)\n\u2003\u2013 P2: \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2013 P3: \u201cPlayer 1 is the criminal.\u201d (This is false, so P3 is not an Investigator.)\n\u2003\u2013 P4: \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2013 P5: \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal.\u201d (In agreement with my truthful statement.)\n\u2003\u2013 P6: \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d (Consistent with me being innocent.)\n\n\u2022 Round 2:\n\u2003\u2013 P1: \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal.\u201d (Again, true.)\n\u2003\u2013 P2: \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal.\u201d (But I have already eliminated P4.)\n\u2003\u2013 P3: \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2013 P4: \u201cPlayer 1 is the criminal.\u201d (False, so P4 is not an Investigator.)\n\u2003\u2013 P5: \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2013 P6: \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d (Consistent with my statement that P4 isn\u2019t criminal.)\n\n\u2022 Round 3:\n\u2003\u2013 P1: \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d (Again, true.)\n\u2003\u2013 P2: \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2013 P3: \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2013 P4: \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal.\u201d (That\u2019s fine because we already know P3 isn\u2019t.)\n\u2003\u2013 P5: \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2013 P6: \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\nObservations so far:\n1. As an Investigator, my statements are reliable. Thus P3 and P4 have been cleared by my statements.\n2. In Round 1, P3\u2019s claim that \u201cPlayer 1 is the criminal\u201d is false, so P3 cannot be an Investigator. Similarly, in Round 2 P4 falsely claims \u201cPlayer 1 is the criminal,\u201d so P4 also is not an Investigator.\n3. Investigators always tell the truth, so their assertions about who is (or is not) the criminal must align with the actual criminal. Because I (P1) must be one of the three Investigators, we need to identify two more whose statements are always true.\n4. Look at rounds where a player\u2019s statements are consistent with known truths:\n\u2003\u2013 Player 5 says \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal\u201d in Round 1, \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal\u201d in Round 2, and \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal\u201d in Round 3. All these are true under any scenario where the criminal is neither 3, 4, nor 6.\n\u2003\u2013 Player 6 says \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal\u201d (Round 1), \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal\u201d (Round 2), and \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal\u201d (Round 3). All these statements would be true provided criminal is not 1, 3, or 4.\nThus P5 and P6 are very good candidates for the remaining Investigators.\n\nWith P1, P5, and P6 as our three Investigators, the criminal must be among the remaining players: Players 2, 3, or 4. But by my statements, P3 and P4 are not criminal. That leaves only Player 2.\n\nNow check the non-Investigators\u2019 statements (Players 2, 3, and 4 across rounds):\n\u2022 Player 2\u2019s statements:\n\u2003\u2013 Round 1: \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal.\u201d (False since P6 is an Investigator.)\n\u2003\u2013 Round 2: \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal.\u201d (False, as P4 is cleared.)\n\u2003\u2013 Round 3: \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal.\u201d (Again false.)\nA non-investigator (criminal, Rumormonger, or Lunatic) is free to provide false statements.\n\u2022 Player 3, already determined non-Investigator, in Round 1 falsely accuses me, and then makes statements in Rounds 2 and 3 that are correct\u2014but this mix is permissible for a non-Investigator.\n\u2022 Player 4, similarly, makes at least one false claim in Round 2, which is acceptable.\n\nAll rounds are fully consistent with:\n\u2013 Investigators: Players 1, 5, and 6.\n\u2013 Criminal: Player 2.\n\u2013 The remaining two non-investigators (the Rumormonger and the Lunatic) being Players 3 and 4 (in some order).\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 2.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

However, in Round 3 Player 3 states that \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal,\u201d which is false given our known fact, and thus rules out Player 3 as always-truthful.

Yet my own statements at different rounds would pin the criminal as follows if taken at face value:\n\u2003\u2022 Round 1: \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal\u201d \u2192 rules out P2.\n\u2003\u2022 Round 2: \u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal\u201d \u2192 indicates criminal = P5.\n\u2003\u2022 Round 3: \u201cPlayer 3 is the criminal\u201d \u2192 indicates criminal = P3.\n\nSince there is exactly one criminal among the 6 players, my own rounds appear to conflict. In a game where an Investigator is always correct, my statements should pinpoint one and the same person. (Likewise, any other Investigator would be fully consistent.) The other players\u2019 statements are mixed because only Investigators are compelled always to tell the truth while Criminals, Rumormongers, and Lunatics may not be consistent.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500  \nHOW TO RECONCILE\n\nBecause my own \u201cInvestigator\u2010status\u201d is given by the game, I must assume that every statement I have made is true. In that case it is impossible to have more than one criminal. Faced with conflicting \u201ctrue\u201d conclusions (P5 in round 2 versus P3 in round 3), I must ask: Could it be that later rounds represent updated judgments as new evidence is revealed? Often in deduction games, later rounds \u201coverride\u201d earlier tentative guesses when new information compels a change of view. \n\nIn that light I review the external validations:\n\u2003\u2013 In Round 2 my declaring P5 as criminal was supported, for example, by P4\u2019s consistent negations of other players as criminals.  \n\u2003\u2013 In Round 3, however, my statement changes, and outside I see that P3 (who in round 1 already testified \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal\u201d) now accuses P4. Also, P6\u2019s round\u20103 accusation (\u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal\u201d) would contradict my round\u20101 clearing of P2. \n\nSeveral players flip their positions between rounds. Given that only Investigators are required to be truthful, the fact that several players\u2019 statements vary suggests that many are not Investigators.  \n\nSince I must be an Investigator\u2014and one of my votes should not change arbitrarily\u2014I face a dilemma. To resolve it I weigh the rounds as follows:\n\u2003\u2022 My Round 1 and Round 2 statements consistently clear P2 and then point to P5.  \n\u2003\u2022 In Round 3 my statement shifts to P3, but very few independent statements from other players solidly support P3 as the criminal.  \n\u2003\u2022 In contrast, the round\u20102 claim \u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal\u201d stands as the only direct accusation from a statement I (an Investigator) made during that round.  \n\nBecause an Investigator\u2019s testimony carries the highest weight and because the majority of conclusions drawn from other players (when compared with the consistency we expect from truth\u2010tellers) do not give strong support for P3 over P5, the best way to \u201creconcile\u201d the overall evidence is to lean on my earlier (and, given my role, truthful) round\u20102 conclusion. In many games a player\u2019s later statements might sometimes be second guesses rather than independent \u201cfacts\u201d about role assignment. In this scenario, the shift in my round\u20113 statement introduces a confusing signal that, in trying to incorporate all rounds, forces me to decide which round I ultimately trust most.\n\nGiven that my round\u20112 judgment (that Player 5 is criminal) was made with the then\u2013available evidence\u2014and because it is supported by some of the other players\u2019 repeated defenses (for example, P2 in round 2 claimed \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal\u201d contrary to what a truthful Investigator would say)\u2014I conclude that the majority of reliable evidence points to Player 5 as the criminal.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500  \nFINAL ASSESSMENT\n\nWhile the rounds present inherent contradictions (which might be the result of evolving \u201cguesses\u201d rather than strict declarations), my duty as an Investigator is to ultimately put forth the conclusion that best fits both my role\u2019s truthfulness and the supporting evidence. In this case I choose to trust the round\u20112 evidence and disregard the conflicting update from round 3 as an overcorrection.\n\nTherefore, based on the overall analysis, my final judgment is:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 5.\nMy Role Is Investigator.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500  \n(Important note: The provided rounds yield some internal inconsistencies. In a real game, such conflicts would prompt further discussion. However, given the instructions and the weight of an Investigator\u2019s truthful statements, I choose to conclude that Player 5 is the criminal.)"

So my announcement may be mistaken about my true role. \n\nStep 3. Look for players who have been completely consistent (always stating truths) across both rounds; those would be Investigators.\n\nExamine each non\u2010P1 player if we assume a candidate for the final Criminal and then see which players\u2019 statements would always be true:\n\n\u2022 Compare what happens if we suppose that the final Criminal is Player 3.\n\n\u2003\u2013 Then the \u201ctrue\u201d fact is: \u201cThe criminal is P3.\u201d\n\u2003\nRound 1 evaluations under \u201ccriminal = P3\u201d:\n\u2003\u2022 P1: \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d (True, since P4 \u2260 P3.)\n\u2003\u2022 P2: \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal.\u201d (True, since P6 \u2260 P3.)\n\u2003\u2022 P3: \u201cPlayer 1 is the criminal.\u201d (False, since criminal is P3, not P1.)\n\u2003\u2022 P4: \u201cPlayer 3 is the criminal.\u201d (True.)\n\u2003\u2022 P5: \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d (True.)\n\u2003\u2022 P6: \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal.\u201d (False.)\n\nRound 2 evaluations under \u201ccriminal = P3\u201d:\n\u2003\u2022 P1: \u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal.\u201d (False, 2 \u2260 3.)\n\u2003\u2022 P2: \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d (True.)\n\u2003\u2022 P3: \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d (True.)\n\u2003\u2022 P4: \u201cPlayer 3 is the criminal.\u201d (True.)\n\u2003\u2022 P5: \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal.\u201d (True.)\n\u2003\u2022 P6: \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal.\u201d (True.)\n\nNow check for consistency:\n\u2003\u2013 Player 2: True in R1 and True in R2.\n\u2003\u2013 Player 4: True in R1 and True in R2.\n\u2003\u2013 Player 5: True in R1 and True in R2.\n\nThat gives us three players (P2, P4, and P5) who always spoke truth\u2014exactly the number of Investigators required.\n\nWhat about the others?  \n\u2003\u2013 P3 (our candidate criminal) made one false statement (R1) and one true (R2), which is allowable for the Criminal.  \n\u2003\u2013 P6 made one false (R1) and one true (R2), which is acceptable for a Rumormonger or a Lunatic.  \n\u2003\u2013 I (P1) made one true (R1) and one false (R2); if I were actually the Criminal I would be allowed to switch at will. However, since three consistent Investigators are now identified (P2, P4, P5), the only possibility left for the remaining non\u2010Investigator players is that one of us is the Criminal and the other is the Rumormonger or Lunatic.\n\nBut here is an important point: At the start I was told \u201cyou are Criminal.\u201d Yet the evidence shows the three players\u2014P2, P4, and P5\u2014are clearly the consistent Investigators, and P3\u2019s statements fit best with that of the actual Criminal (since P3 claims \u201cP1 is the criminal\u201d in Round 1, then contradicts that in Round 2). With three Investigators determined, the remaining two roles (aside from the Criminal) must be assigned to me (P1) and Player 6. Since only one Criminal exists and we already have a candidate in P3, this forces my true role to be not Criminal. Given that both Rumormongers and Lunatics can say arbitrary things, however note this crucial difference: Rumormongers believe they are Investigators while Lunatics believe they are Criminals. Since I was told (and thus believe) that I am the Criminal, it indicates that although I was led to think I\u2019m Criminal, I very likely am in fact the Lunatic. \n\nStep 4. Final Role Assignment under the \u201cfinal criminal is P3\u201d scenario:\n\u2003\u2013 Final Criminal: Player 3.\n\u2003\u2013 Investigators (always truthful): Players 2, 4, and 5.\n\u2003\u2013 Among the remaining players, one is Rumormonger and one is Lunatic. Since I (P1) was told I am Criminal (as are Lunatics), I conclude that my true role is Lunatic.\n\u2003\u2013 That leaves Player 6 as the Rumormonger.\n\nStep 5. Conclude Final Judgment:\nBased on the combined evidence from rounds 1 and 2, the most consistent explanation is that the actual criminal is Player 3 and my true role is Lunatic (even though I was told I was Criminal).\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 3.\nMy Role Is Lunatic."

I know I\u2019m an Investigator, so my statement \u201cPlayer\u00a04 is not the criminal\u201d must be true. Therefore, Player\u00a04 is definitely not the criminal.\n\n2. The other statements are:\n\u2003\u2022 Player\u00a02: \u201cPlayer\u00a05 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 Player\u00a03: \u201cPlayer\u00a05 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 Player\u00a04: \u201cPlayer\u00a02 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 Player\u00a05: \u201cPlayer\u00a03 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 Player\u00a06: \u201cPlayer\u00a05 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\n3. Because there are three Investigators (who always tell the truth) and I already am one, it is plausible that some of the \u201cnot the criminal\u201d claims (by Players\u00a02 and\u00a04, and possibly Player\u00a06) come from Investigators. In that case, their factual assertions imply that neither Player\u00a02, Player\u00a04, nor Player\u00a05 can be criminal. That would leave Player\u00a03 or Player\u00a06 as possibilities.\n\n4. Notice that Player\u00a03 claims \u201cPlayer\u00a05 is the criminal.\u201d If Player\u00a03 were an Investigator, then his claim would force Player\u00a05 to be criminal.

In that scenario, Player\u00a03\u2019s statement is false\u2014which is acceptable if Player\u00a03 is the Criminal (or one of the roles allowed to lie). Also, Player\u00a05\u2019s statement \u201cPlayer\u00a03 is not the criminal\u201d would then be false, which is allowable from a non\u2010Investigator.\n\n6.

I know for sure that I\u2019m an Investigator, so my statement \u201cPlayer\u00a04 is not the criminal\u201d is necessarily true. That immediately means P4 can\u2019t be the criminal.\n\n2. The six Round\u202f2 statements are:\n\u2003\u2022 P1 (me): \u201cPlayer\u00a04 is not the criminal.\u201d (True.)\n\u2003\u2022 P2: \u201cPlayer\u00a05 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 P3: \u201cPlayer\u00a01 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 P4: \u201cPlayer\u00a06 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 P5: \u201cPlayer\u00a03 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 P6: \u201cPlayer\u00a05 is the criminal.\u201d\n\n3. An Investigator always tells the truth, so whichever players are Investigators must be giving fully correct statements. We already have one (P1). Given that exactly three players are Investigators, we seek a grouping of three whose statements are consistent with one particular assignment of the criminal.\n\n4. One appealing possibility is as follows. Suppose that the criminal is Player 5. Then let\u2019s check each statement:\n\u2003\u2013 My statement \u201cPlayer\u00a04 is not the criminal\u201d remains true.\n\u2003\u2013 P2\u2019s statement \u201cPlayer\u00a05 is not the criminal\u201d is false (as needed if P2 is not an Investigator).\n\u2003\u2013 P3 says \u201cPlayer\u00a01 is not the criminal\u201d \u2013 that\u2019s true, so P3 could be an Investigator.\n\u2003\u2013 P4 says \u201cPlayer\u00a06 is the criminal\u201d \u2013 that is false, so P4 (even though not the criminal as confirmed by me) must be non\u2010Investigator.\n\u2003\u2013 P5 (if criminal) can say anything, and his saying \u201cPlayer\u00a03 is the criminal\u201d is false.\n\u2003\u2013 P6 says \u201cPlayer\u00a05 is the criminal\u201d \u2013 that is true, so P6 could be the third Investigator.\n\n5. In this scenario the three truth-tellers (and thus genuine Investigators) are P1 (me), P3, and P6. Their statements are all in agreement with the fact that P5 is the criminal. The others (P2, P4, and criminal P5) may provide false or arbitrary statements. This distribution fits the rules (three Investigators and, respectively, one Criminal, one Rumormonger, and one Lunatic).\n\nBased on the Round\u202f2 statements, I conclude:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 5.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

I know for sure that I (Player\u202f1) am an Investigator and, therefore, my statement \u201cPlayer\u202f6 is not the criminal\u201d is absolutely true. This immediately rules out Player\u202f6 as the criminal.\n\n2. Looking at everyone else:\n\u2003\u2022 Player\u202f2 says \u201cPlayer\u202f1 is not the criminal.\u201d Being correct regardless of role, if Player\u202f2 were an investigator his statement is certainly true.\n\u2003\u2022 Player\u202f3 says \u201cPlayer\u202f1 is the criminal.\u201d This directly contradicts what I know for sure. Since Investigators never lie, Player\u202f3 cannot be one. His statement is false and is a strong signal that he is not telling us the truth \u2013 he may well be the criminal (or at least not an investigator).\n\u2003\u2022 Player\u202f4 says \u201cPlayer\u202f2 is not the criminal.\u201d If Player\u202f4 were an Investigator this would be true, but if he is the criminal he has no duty to tell only truths.\n\u2003\u2022 Player\u202f5 says \u201cPlayer\u202f3 is not the criminal.\u201d That statement is true if Player\u202f3 is innocent, but false if Player\u202f3 is guilty.\n\u2003\u2022 Player\u202f6 says \u201cPlayer\u202f4 is the criminal.\u201d And we already know Player\u202f6 cannot be the criminal (by my own true statement). Although non\u2010investigators can sometimes say truths by chance, a statement accusing Player\u202f4 is a notable claim.\n\n3. I have two very plausible candidate scenarios:\n\n\u2003A. If Player\u202f3 were the criminal:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Then my (Player\u202f1) statement is fine.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Player\u202f2\u2019s statement (\u201cPlayer\u202f1 is not the criminal\u201d) is true.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Player\u202f4 could be an Investigator (truthfully saying \u201cPlayer\u202f2 is not the criminal\u201d), and\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Player\u202f5\u2019s claim (\u201cPlayer\u202f3 is not the criminal\u201d) would be false.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Player\u202f6\u2019s claim (\u201cPlayer\u202f4 is criminal\u201d) would also be false.\n\u2003\u2003This would give us three truthful Investigator statements (by Players\u202f1, 2, and 4) and three non\u2010investigators (Players\u202f3, 5, and 6) each with a false statement (or at least not required to be truthful).  \n\n\u2003B. If Player\u202f4 were the criminal:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 My statement is still true.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Player\u202f2\u2019s statement remains true.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Player\u202f5\u2019s statement (\u201cPlayer\u202f3 is not the criminal\u201d) would then be true if we assume Player\u202f3 isn\u2019t criminal.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Player\u202f3\u2019s false accusation of me fits with him being non\u2010investigator.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 And crucially, Player\u202f6\u2019s statement (\u201cPlayer\u202f4 is the criminal\u201d) comes out correct.  \n\u2003\u2003In this scenario the three Investigators could be Players\u202f1,\u202f2, and\u202f5 (all issuing true statements), with the criminal (Player\u202f4) and two others (Players\u202f3 and\u202f6) being non\u2010investigators. Note that although non\u2010investigators (Rumormonger or Lunatic) are allowed to accidentally say true things, investigators are uniquely always truthful. The fact that two players (Players\u202f2 and\u202f5) make completely unambiguous, truth\u2010consistent statements supports a picture in which they are the other Investigators. Player\u202f6\u2019s statement then matching the truth (that Player\u202f4 is criminal) further tips the balance.\n\n4. Considering that in scenario B the set of guaranteed true statements (from me, Player\u202f2, and Player\u202f5) is perfectly consistent and Player\u202f6 happens to call out Player\u202f4 as criminal, I lean toward Player\u202f4 being the criminal.\n\nThus, based only on the Round\u202f1 statements, the analysis most strongly supports that the criminal is Player\u202f4.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 4.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

Let\u2019s list the Round\u202f2 statements:\n\u2003\u2022 Player\u202f1 (me): \u201cPlayer\u202f6 is not the criminal.\u201d (true)\n\u2003\u2022 Player\u202f2: \u201cPlayer\u202f6 is the criminal.\u201d (Since Player\u202f6 is not criminal, this statement is false.)\n\u2003\u2022 Player\u202f3: \u201cPlayer\u202f4 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 Player\u202f4: \u201cPlayer\u202f2 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 Player\u202f5: \u201cPlayer\u202f1 is not the criminal.\u201d (true, since I\u2019m not criminal.)\n\u2003\u2022 Player\u202f6: \u201cPlayer\u202f2 is the criminal.\u201d\n\n3. We already know that Player\u202f1\u2019s and Player\u202f5\u2019s statements are true. They are either Investigators (who always tell the truth) or non\u2010investigators who happened to state a truth. However, as an Investigator I know that if someone is truly an Investigator their statement must be true. This gives us strong candidates for Investigators, because the game always has exactly three Investigators. It seems likely that Players\u202f1,\u202f3, and\u202f5 might be the Investigators if all their statements can be consistently true.\n\n4. Consider Player\u202f3\u2019s statement: \u201cPlayer\u202f4 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003If Player\u202f3 is an Investigator, then his statement must be true\u2014and hence Player\u202f4 is indeed the criminal.\n\u2003Let\u2019s test that possibility:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 My statement \u201cPlayer\u202f6 is not the criminal\u201d is true.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Assuming Player\u202f3 is an Investigator, \u201cPlayer\u202f4 is the criminal\u201d is true.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Player\u202f5 says \u201cPlayer\u202f1 is not the criminal\u201d which is true.\n\u2003These would then be the three Investigators (Players\u202f1,\u202f3, and\u202f5).\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 That leaves Players\u202f2,\u202f4, and\u202f6 as non\u2010Investigators. We already rule out Player\u202f6 as criminal by my statement.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Player\u202f4, in this scenario, would be the criminal. As the criminal, his statement (\u201cPlayer\u202f2 is not the criminal\u201d) can be arbitrarily true or false.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Players\u202f2 and\u202f6, as non\u2010Investigators (either Rumormonger or Lunatic), make false statements (\u201cPlayer\u202f6 is the criminal\u201d and \u201cPlayer\u202f2 is the criminal,\u201d respectively) which fits.\n\u2003This possibility is perfectly consistent: there are three always\u2010truthful Investigators (Players\u202f1,\u202f3, and\u202f5) and only one criminal (Player 4).\n\n5. Alternatively, if we try to let someone else be the criminal (say, Player\u202f3), then Player\u202f3\u2019s statement \u201cPlayer\u202f4 is the criminal\u201d would be false. However, then we\u2019d have to assign Investigator roles to some other trio, and it would require dismissing Player\u202f3 as an Investigator. The pattern of statements aligns more neatly if we treat Player\u202f3 as honest (i.e. an Investigator) and accept his accusation that Player\u202f4 is the criminal.\n\n6. Therefore, the most consistent allocation based on Round\u202f2 is:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Investigators: Players\u202f1,\u202f3, and\u202f5.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Criminal: Player\u202f4.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Non\u2010Investigators (Rumormonger/Lunatic): Players\u202f2 and\u202f6.\n\nBased on that analysis:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 4.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

For example, Player\u202f6 said \u201cPlayer\u202f4 is the criminal\u201d; if Player\u202f2 is criminal then that statement is false. Also, Player\u202f3 said \u201cPlayer\u202f1 is the criminal\u201d (which is false if I am Investigator). These inconsistencies indicate that several players are not Investigators and hence may be the criminal (or one of the other roles); crucially, however, my own statement in Round\u202f3 is infallible.\n\n\u2013 In Round\u202f2, note that Player\u202f4 stated \u201cPlayer\u202f2 is not the criminal.\u201d If the criminal is indeed Player\u202f2, that statement is false. Since only Investigators are required to be truthful, this tells me that Player\u202f4 is not an Investigator. (Non\u2010Investigator roles may say truths sometimes, but their statements are not reliable in every round.)\n\nWhile the previous rounds had arguments that might have suggested another candidate (for example, an earlier reading might have favored Player\u202f4), my new and unambiguous assignment in Round\u202f3 (supported by my lifelong role as Investigator) now forces the conclusion that the criminal is Player\u202f2. It may be that some non\u2010Investigator has, coincidentally, given a correct statement in one round while misleading in another; however, my own statement is the reliable reveal.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nFinal Conclusion:\nBecause I make no mistakes as an Investigator, my Round\u202f3 statement \u201cPlayer\u202f2 is the criminal\u201d is the final, trusted evidence. \n\nThus, my final judgment is:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 2.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

Player 6 consistently denies the truth, which suggests his role is not one of the always-truthful Investigators\u2014likely a Lunatic or a misinformed Rumormonger.  \n\nGiven that the truthful statements (made by Investigators) point to me as the criminal and knowing that my actual role is Criminal, the final analysis remains unchanged.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.  \nMy Role Is Criminal."

Genuine Investigators would have stated the truth on every question; for example, if asked about me, they must say \u201cPlayer 1 is the criminal.\u201d Yet in Round 1 and 2 we see several players (P2, P3, and P6) claiming \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d That immediately rules them out as genuine Investigators. In fact, none of the other players has been completely consistent with the truth\u2010telling requirement. (For instance, while Player 5 was truthful in two rounds, he made an incorrect claim in Round 3 saying \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal.\u201d)\n\nGiven that there must be exactly 3 genuine Investigators, the only way to reconcile the available statements with the role abilities is to accept my known card: I am Criminal. (The other players\u2019 puzzling mix of true and false claims then indicate that none of them is playing the genuine Investigator role consistently\u2014they must be the Rumormonger or Lunatic when mistaken or deliberately misleading.)\n\nThus, regardless of the imperfect consistency of the others, my deduction remains anchored on the fact that I was told I am Criminal. The other rounds reinforce that all statements about \u201cnot the criminal\u201d are correct under the fact that I remain the sole Criminal\u2014but the failure of others to mention that I am Criminal when they should (if they were genuine Investigators) indicates their roles are either Rumormonger or Lunatic.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nFinal Judgment\n\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

(Criminals may tell truth or lie.)\n\u2022\u20031 Rumormonger \u2013 who thinks they\u2019re an Investigator but may be wrong.\n\u2022\u20031 Lunatic \u2013 who thinks they\u2019re a Criminal and may tell truth or lie.\n\nRound 1 Statements:\n\u2022\u2003Player 1 (me) says \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2022\u2003Player 2: \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2022\u2003Player 3: \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2022\u2003Player 4: \u201cPlayer 3 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2022\u2003Player 5: \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2022\u2003Player 6: \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\nSince Investigators always tell the truth, any statement made by an Investigators is 100% correct. However, the two accusations in the middle conflict (Player 4 says P3 is criminal while Player 5 says P4 is criminal). At least one of those must be coming from a non\u2010Investigator (a Rumormonger or Lunatic) since if an Investigator said that then it would be irrefutable information. \n\nAt this point, though, we have no way to identify with complete confidence who is Investigator or not. More importantly, based on our assignment I (Player 1) have been told that my actual role is Criminal. (As a Criminal, I can choose to say something true or false.) \n\nGiven the information in Round 1, nothing forces me to change the known fact about my role. In addition, none of the truthful (Investigator) statements force us to conclude a criminal identity that contradicts the known assignment for me. (For instance, if an Investigator had said \u201cPlayer X is the criminal,\u201d then that would be inviolable; here, conflicting accusations indicate that at least one accuser must be using misinformation.) \n\nThus, after Round 1, the strongest \u201cfinal\u201d conclusion we can make is that I remain the Criminal. (Other players\u2019 statements cannot override the role information given to me, though they may be used for further deduction in later rounds.) \n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

An Investigator\u2019s statements are completely reliable. Notice that both Player\u00a02 and Player\u00a05 state that \u201cPlayer\u00a03 is not the criminal.\u201d If one (or both) is an Investigator, then indeed Player\u00a03 must not be the criminal\u2014and that is consistent with my known role.\n2. In contrast, Player\u00a06\u2019s statement says \u201cPlayer\u00a01 is not the criminal.\u201d Since I know I am criminal, this is a false statement. Thus Player\u00a06 cannot be an Investigator (so they must be either the Rumormonger or the Lunatic).\n3. Also, Player\u00a04 insists that \u201cPlayer\u00a03 is the criminal.\u201d Since we have two others (P2 and P5) saying \u201cPlayer\u00a03 is not the criminal,\u201d at least one of these must come from a non\u2010Investigator. In fact, if an Investigator said \u201cPlayer\u00a03 is the criminal\u201d it would be incontrovertible\u2014but that would conflict with my knowledge. Thus Player\u00a04 (and likewise Player\u00a03 whose Round\u00a02 claim \u201cPlayer\u00a04 is the criminal\u201d would then imply a second criminal) cannot be an Investigator.\n\nWith the above in mind we can see that aside from me (Player\u00a01, the Criminal) the statements that are completely trustworthy can come from only one clearly reliable candidate: Player\u00a02. (Players\u00a03, 4, 5, and 6 are giving conflicting and/or false claims that prevent them from being clearly Investigator\u2010like.) Although the game calls for three Investigators, our available statement evidence from rounds 1 and 2 forces us to be cautious\u2014others might be Investigators, but we cannot unambiguously identify them given these conflicting accusations. (Remember that Rumormongers, believing they are Investigators, may accidentally say the truth even though they are not bound to it.)\n\nBecause none of the reliable testimonies actually point to any player other than me being the criminal, and because I already know\u2014I was told\u2014that I am the Criminal, our overall conclusion remains unchanged.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal.\n\nThis is the most likely conclusion based on the statements from Round\u00a02 (in the context of all rounds)."

I know without doubt that I am an Investigator. Thus, every statement I make must be true. In Round 2 I stated that \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal.\u201d This is a fact I can rely on from the current round. (It also means that if an earlier round appears to point to a different criminal, then new evidence has forced an update in our conclusions.)\n\n2. Given that there is exactly one Criminal in the game, my truthful Round 2 assertion forces the conclusion: Final Criminal = Player 4.\n\n3. Although my Round 1 statement claimed \u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal,\u201d it must now be revised in light of the Round 2 evidence. In these multi\u2010round games, later rounds (or reconciling all of the statements together) may expose past inconsistencies; as an Investigator I must update my public belief to match the complete set of statements. (It is possible that in Round 1 I had reason to suspect Player 5 based on incomplete information, but Round 2\u2019s information\u2014and the fact that I am faithfully truthful\u2014now tells us that Player 4 is the criminal.)\n\n4. For the other players:\n\u2003\u2013 Player 6 in Round 2 contradicted my statement by saying \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d Since I (an assured Investigator) cannot be wrong, Player 6\u2019s statement must be false, so Player 6 is not an Investigator.\n\u2003\u2013 The remaining players\u2019 statements are supplemental; for example, Player 4 saying \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal\u201d fits with the current conclusion, and Players 2, 3, and 5 eliminating other suspects help narrow down the available slots.\n\u2003\u2013 (A full role assignment would reconcile Investigator, Rumormonger, and Lunatic behavior, but our primary task is to identify the Criminal.)\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\nFinal Judgment for Round 2:\n\nBecause I am Investigator and in Round 2 I truthfully stated \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal,\u201d my updated conclusion is:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 4.\nMy Role Is Investigator.\n\nThis is my most likely conclusion after considering the statements across both rounds, updating my analysis with the latest evidence."

In a \u201cperfect\u201d game the Investigator\u2019s identifications never conflict; one would always name the same criminal. In the rounds provided my own statements conflict (Rounds 1 and 2 say one thing while Round 3 says the opposite), so we must treat the rounds as successive rounds where later information forces an update of our view. (In effect, think of each round\u2019s \u201cfinal judgment\u201d as an opportunity to reassess as more (possibly misleading) information comes in.)\n\nExamining Round 3 by itself:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003I (Player 1) say \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal.\u201d That is a guaranteed fact.\n\u2003\u2022\u2003All players except myself in Round 3 are making \u201cexculpatory\u201d statements (listing \u201cnot criminal\u201d) except one: Player 3 accuses \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal.\u201d\n\nIf I assume that by now my updated assessment must obey my latest (and truthful) statement and must take note that several other players (whose statuses are uncertain because only true Investigators always tell the truth) are now pointing toward one candidate, I note that:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 In Round 2 two players (P3 and P5) said \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 In Round 3, once again P3 says \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal.\u201d\nThus, even though I cannot fully trust accusations from players who might be Rumormongers or Lunatics, the recurring allegation that Player 6 is the criminal appears repeatedly.\n\nAt the same time, in Round 3 I and P6 both state \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal,\u201d so the earlier Round 1 accusation of Player 3 (by me and by P2) must be superseded by later information.\n\nBalancing the rounds (with the understanding that later rounds are meant to bring us closer to the truth) it appears that the best remaining candidate is Player 6. In other words, given:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003My final round statement eliminates Player 3,\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Other direct \u201cnot criminal\u201d claims eliminate P2 and P4,\n\u2003\u2022\u2003And multiple independent accusations (P3 in both rounds 2 and 3, and P5 in round 2) point to Player 6,\nI update my conclusion to name Player 6 as the criminal.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 6.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

I was told I\u2019m an Investigator, but we must check whether the complete set of statements is consistent with that.\n\nFirst, list each player\u2019s statements by round:\n\n\u2003Round 1  \n\u2003\u2003P1: \u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003P2: \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003P3: \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003P4: \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003P5: \u201cPlayer 3 is the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003P6: \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\n\u2003Round 2  \n\u2003\u2003P1: \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003P2: \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003P3: \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003P4: \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003P5: \u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003P6: \u201cPlayer 1 is the criminal.\u201d\n\n\u2003Round 3  \n\u2003\u2003P1: \u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003P2: \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003P3: \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003P4: \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003P5: \u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003P6: \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\nNow, if I were a genuine Investigator then all my statements must be true. But look at my statements over the rounds:  \n\u2003\u2022 Round 1: I claim T = Player 5.  \n\u2003\u2022 Round 2: I claim Player 6 is not the criminal (so T \u2260 6).  \n\u2003\u2022 Round 3: I claim T = Player 2.\n\nThere is no single criminal that would make all three of these true. (Player 5 cannot equal player 2, and player 6 is ruled out by my round\u20112 statement.)  \n\nSo if I were the genuine Investigator, I would be compelled always to state the same truth about who the criminal is. The contradiction in my own statements shows that, despite being told I am an Investigator, my overall set of claims is not consistent with the truth\u2010teller behavior required of an Investigator.\n\nLet\u2019s see if we can identify a set of players whose statements are internally consistent. Notice the following:  \n\n\u2022 Player 2\u2019s statements:  \n\u2003\u2013 R1: \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2013 R2: \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2013 R3: \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d  \nIf Player 2 were an actual Investigator, then the criminal would be Player 6.  \n\n\u2022 Player 3\u2019s statements:  \n\u2003\u2013 R1: \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2013 R2: \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2013 R3: \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal.\u201d  \nAgain, if Player 3 is genuine, then T = Player 6.  \n\n\u2022 Player 4\u2019s statements:  \n\u2003\u2013 R1: \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2013 R2: \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2013 R3: \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d  \nThese all would be true if the criminal is neither 2 nor 5. (That would be consistent with T = 6.)  \n\nThus, if we accept Players 2, 3, and 4 as our genuine Investigators, their statements agree that Player 6 is the criminal. The other players (1, 5, and 6) must then be in the roles that do not require always telling the truth. Notice that Player 6 (the accused criminal by the reliable trio) issues contradictory statements, and Players 1 and 5 give conflicting and false accusations relative to the consensus.\n\nGiven that my own statements are contradictory and do not match the consistency we\u2019d expect from a genuine Investigator, I must conclude that\u2014even though I was told I am Investigator\u2014I cannot confidently claim that role based on the overall pattern.\n\nTherefore, my final conclusions are:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 6.\nMy Role Is Unknown."

My statements were as follows:\n\u2003\u2022 Round 1: \u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 Round 2: \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 Round 3: \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003Because there is only one criminal, all Investigator statements must be consistent. In other words, if I am truly an Investigator, then the criminal can only be one player. Rounds 2 and 3 (and additional players\u2019 rounds) show much stronger consistency in support of Player 6:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 In Round 2 my statement (\u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal\u201d) aligns with Player 5\u2019s claim (\u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal\u201d) and is unchallenged by other players\u2019 eliminatory claims.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 In Round 3, although I did not claim a criminal this round, no one contradicts the possibility of Player 6 being the criminal. In fact, Player 5 again says \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Other players\u2019 statements in Rounds 2 and 3 exclude other candidates (for example, several players consistently rule out Player 2, Player 3, and Player 4 as being criminal).\n\n3. The discrepancy with my Round 1 statement (\u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal\u201d) suggests that either my initial belief was later updated as new evidence emerged or the later rounds provide a clearer consensus. Because all rounds must eventually cohere with the single factual criminal, the later rounds are more consistent and have broader support toward one candidate.\n\n4. Taking all of this into account, the most likely true scenario is that the criminal is Player 6. (This fits with the majority of rounds\u2014including my unambiguous statement in Round 2 and repeated support from Player 5\u2014and is not contradicted by the consistent negations in Round 3.)\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 6.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

The mechanics require that Investigators are the only ones who always state the truth about who is (or isn\u2019t) the Criminal. In a given round, when an Investigator is asked to comment on a player\u2019s criminal status, they must say \u201cis criminal\u201d if that player is indeed the Criminal or \u201cis not criminal\u201d otherwise.\n\n3. In Round 1 the statements were:\n\u2003\u2022 Player 1 (me): \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 Player 2: \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 Player 3: \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 Player 4: \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 Player 5: \u201cPlayer 3 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 Player 6: \u201cPlayer 3 is the criminal.\u201d\n\n4.

Although we expect three Investigators in the game, the answers in Round 1 do not provide any statement that correctly identifies me (Player 1) as Criminal. As a result, the round\u2019s statements do not allow us to clearly sort players into Investigator versus non\u2010Investigator groups. However, since I know for certain my role is Criminal, I must conclude that the \u201cfinal criminal\u201d is indeed me.\n\nThus, despite all the misleading accusations in Round 1, using my personal information I conclude:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

As truthful Investigators always provide correct information, Player 3 is not an Investigator.\n\u2003\u2013 Player 4\u2019s statement, \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal,\u201d is factually true.\n\u2003\u2013 Player 5 says \u201cPlayer 1 is the criminal,\u201d which is correct.\n\u2003\u2013 Player 6 states \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal,\u201d which is false.\n\n4. Since only Investigators provide consistently truthful answers regarding who the criminal is, it\u2019s plausible to suspect that the consistently truthful statements in this round come from Players 2, 4, and 5. Meanwhile, the false statements by Players 3 and 6 suggest they are not among the investigators. As for me (Player 1), my role is predetermined as Criminal\u2014so my statement does not fall under the strict truth-telling requirement.\n\n5. Based solely on Round 3 and my known information, the true criminal remains Player 1.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

I (Player 1) have been told I am the Criminal.\n\n2. Investigators must always tell the truth about whether someone is Criminal. In Round 1 only statements that are factually correct if spoken by an Investigator can come from a genuine Investigator.\n\n3. Let\u2019s check each statement assuming the only Criminal is Player 1:\n\u2003\u2022 Player 1 (me) says \u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal.\u201d Since I am allowed to say anything as Criminal, this may be chosen to mislead.\n\u2003\u2022 Player 2 says \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal.\u201d Under the true state (Criminal = Player 1) this statement is false. Therefore Player 2 cannot be one of the three genuine Investigators and must be either Rumormonger or Lunatic.\n\u2003\u2022 Player 3 says \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d Since indeed Player 5 is not Criminal (only Player 1 is), this statement is correct. This is consistent with the behavior of a genuine Investigator (or a non\u2010investigator who happens to be correct).\n\u2003\u2022 Player 4 says \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d But we know Player 1 is Criminal, so this statement is false. Therefore Player 4 cannot be a genuine Investigator.\n\u2003\u2022 Player 5 says \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d Knowing Criminal is Player 1, this statement is true. Thus Player 5 might be a genuine Investigator.\n\u2003\u2022 Player 6 says \u201cPlayer 3 is the criminal.\u201d Since Player 1 is the criminal, this is false and so Player 6 is not a genuine Investigator.\n\n4. In a game with 3 genuine Investigators there should be three statements that are guaranteed correct. Based only on the truth concerning the actual Criminal (Player 1), only Players 3 and 5 have made statements that are definitely true. (The other players\u2019 statements are false.) One of the remaining three (Players 2, 4, or 6) would need to be a genuine Investigator if they were to fulfill the quota, but none could be because their statements conflict with reality.\n\n5. This discrepancy does not change the fact about my assignment. It does indicate that under these Round 1 statements the other players\u2019 statements are a mix coming from non-investigators (Rumormonger and Lunatic) whose answers can be misleading. As Criminal, I know I sometimes contribute deliberately confusing information.\n\n6. Considering all of the above, based solely on Round 1 evidence (and my known assignment) my best concluding judgment is that the Criminal is indeed me\u2014Player 1\u2014and I must keep my role as Criminal.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

(This is acceptable from the Criminal because I can deliberately mislead.)\n\n\u2022 P2: \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2013 With P1 as Criminal, this is false. An Investigator would never make a false claim, so P2 is not a genuine Investigator.\n\n\u2022 P3: \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2013 Since only P1 is Criminal, this statement is true. (A genuine Investigator would say this, but non-investigators may also sometimes say true things.)\n\n\u2022 P4: \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2013 This is false, because I am the Criminal. Thus P4 is not one of the perfect-truth-telling Investigators.\n\n\u2022 P5: \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2013 This statement is true.

(Again, acceptable for the Criminal.)\n\n\u2022 P2: \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2013 True, because P1 is Criminal. (However, note that P2\u2019s Round 1 statement was false, which is not allowed for a genuine Investigator.)\n\n\u2022 P3: \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2013 False; this contradicts our assumption. (So P3 cannot be a genuine Investigator even though his Round 1 claim was true.)\n\n\u2022 P4: \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2013 This statement is true, but P4 already made a false statement in Round 1. (Thus, P4 is not a trustworthy Investigator.)\n\n\u2022 P5: \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2013 True, given that P1 is the Criminal. (P5 has now made two statements that are both correct. Investigators are required to be consistently truthful, which makes P5 a strong candidate for an Investigator.)\n\n\u2022 P6: \u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2013 False.

Since genuine Investigators must always speak truthfully, P5 is highly likely to be an Investigator.  \n\u2022 None of the other players have been consistently truthful over both rounds; each has at least one false statement, so they cannot be genuine Investigators.  \n\u2022 Although the game calls for three Investigators, the statements given in these two rounds only allow one player (P5) to be confidently identified as always truthful. The remaining players (P2, P3, P4, and P6) must therefore be either the Rumormonger or the Lunatic (or in my case, I am the Criminal). Their inconsistent truthfulness is allowed by their roles since only the Investigators are bound to always tell the truth.\n\nGiven that:\n\u2013 I know my role is Criminal (by game assignment).\n\u2013 All statements, when evaluated with that assumption, are consistent with me being Criminal.\n\u2013 The statements themselves do not give enough consistent evidence to conclusively determine the exact roles for Players 2, 3, 4, and 6. However, for my judgment I only need to state who I believe is the Criminal and what my own role is.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500  \nFinal Judgment (after Round 2):\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

Because I know the true criminal is me, we compare each statement with the truth:\n\u2003\u2013 A true statement about \u201cthe criminal\u201d must correctly identify Player\u00a01 as criminal.\n\u2003\u2013 Thus, any statement claiming someone else is criminal is false.\n4. Evaluation:\n\u2003\u2022 P1\u2019s statement is false (claiming P4 is criminal instead of the real criminal, me).\n\u2003\u2022 P2\u2019s statement is false.\n\u2003\u2022 P3\u2019s statement is \u201cPlayer\u00a04 is not the criminal.\u201d This is a true remark (since I \u2013 Player\u00a01 \u2013 am criminal).

The game rules require that all Investigators must tell the truth. Seeing that only one statement (P3\u2019s) is outright in line with the true fact and the other five are false, it appears that among the six players only one player clearly followed the \u201calways truthful\u201d Investigator rule. (In a complete game there would be three Investigators, but note that the Rumormonger \u2013 who believes they are an Investigator \u2013 and the Lunatic \u2013 who believes they are Criminal \u2013 may both state things that are false. In our Round\u00a01 statements, aside from the true statement from P3, every other statement is either deceptive or purposefully misleading.)\n6. Thus my deduction after Round\u00a01 is that:\n\u2003\u2013 I remain the actual Criminal.\n\u2003\u2013 The only clearly truthful statement came from P3, suggesting that P3 is almost certainly a genuine Investigator.\n\u2003\u2013 The others (P2, P4, P5, and P6) are providing false or misleading information as expected from roles that are not genuine Investigators (i.e. me, the Criminal; the Rumormonger; and the Lunatic).\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\nFinal Judgment After Round\u00a01:\n\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

(By game rules, only true Investigators always give statements that are 100% correct regarding whether a given player is the Criminal. Criminals, Rumormongers, and Lunatics may give statements that are sometimes true and sometimes false.)\n\nRound 2 statements are:\n\u2022 P1: \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2022 P2: \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2022 P3: \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2022 P4: \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2022 P5: \u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2022 P6: \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\nGiven the true criminal is me (Player 1), here is how each statement compares with fact:\n\u2003\u2013 P1\u2019s statement: \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Since I (Player 1) am the criminal, Player 3 is indeed not criminal. This statement is factually true.\n\u2003\u2013 P2\u2019s statement: \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 True, because the criminal is Player 1.\n\u2003\u2013 P3\u2019s statement: \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 This is false, because I am the criminal.\n\u2003\u2013 P4\u2019s statement: \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 True.\n\u2003\u2013 P5\u2019s statement: \u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 False (since the criminal is Player 1).\n\u2003\u2013 P6\u2019s statement: \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 False.\n\nNow, keep in mind:\n\u2003\u2022 Genuine Investigators must always state the truth. In Round 2, an Investigator\u2019s statement would be correct in every round.\n\u2003\u2022 In Round 1, we saw only one statement appeared correct (P3\u2019s \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal\u201d), which at that time suggested P3 might be a true Investigator. However, in Round 2 P3 stated \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal\u201d (a false statement), which contradicts the Investigator rule.\n\u2003\u2022 Similarly, several players switched between true and false outcomes across rounds. This inconsistency suggests that \u2013 aside from my own role (Criminal) \u2013 the remaining speakers are likely from the set of roles (Rumormonger or Lunatic) who are allowed to be incorrect, or possibly even Criminal if not for the fact I occupy that role.\n\u2003\nThus, with the evidence from Round 2 (and reconciling with Round 1):\n\u2003\u2013 I know for a fact that I am the Criminal (as told).\n\u2003\u2013 Since genuine Investigators would have given only true statements and no one besides my own statement (which does not need to follow Investigator rules) was consistently truthful across rounds, I cannot confidently name any of the other players as genuine Investigators based solely on these rounds.\n\u2003\nGiven that the game requires three Investigators, it is clear they must be hidden among the players who sometimes made correct and sometimes incorrect statements (likely because one or more of them are Rumormongers who believe they are Investigators but can be wrong), but I cannot determine their identities with the information available.\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\nFinal Judgment After Round 2:\n\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

Player 3 said \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d Whether Player 3 is an Investigator or not, this statement agrees with what we know: I am not the criminal. (As an Investigator, I\u2019m definitely not.)\n\n3. Player 2 said \u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal.\u201d If Player 6 is the criminal (per my truthful statement) then Player 2\u2019s claim is false. That tells us that Player 2 cannot be an Investigator (because an Investigator would not make a false claim).\n\n4. Player 4 said \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d This statement is consistent with the idea that Player 6 is the criminal, so it may be truthful. Player 4 is a candidate for being one of the truthful Investigators, though we have to note there are exactly three Investigators in the game.\n\n5. Player 5 said \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal.\u201d Again, if Player 6 is the criminal this statement is factually correct; however, it does not guarantee that Player 5 is an Investigator because non-Investigators (the Rumormonger or Lunatic) might accidentally state a truth.\n\n6. Player 6 said \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d Since Player 6 is, by my investigation, the Criminal (and Criminals can lie or tell the truth arbitrarily), this statement does not affect the deduction.\n\nBased on my role as an Investigator and my own statement, I must take my information as correct. There is no conflict from the other statements (keeping in mind that only Investigators must always be truthful) with the conclusion that the criminal is Player 6.\n\nThus, my final judgment for Round 1 is:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 6.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

So my past Round 1 declaration, \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal,\u201d must be true. Also, in Round 2 I declared \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal\u201d and that, too, is unquestionably true.\n\nLet\u2019s list the Round 2 statements along with what they imply if we accept as true that (a) I (P1) am an Investigator and (b) my Round 1 statement \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal\u201d is correct:\n\n1.\u2003Player 1 (me): \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2003\u25aa\u2003Because I\u2019m an Investigator, it must be that Player 4 is indeed not the criminal.\n\n2.\u2003Player 2: \u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2003\u25aa\u2003If the criminal is Player 6 (from my Round 1 truth), then this statement is false. (Since an Investigator must always be truthful, this falsity tells us that Player 2 is not one of the truthful Investigators.)\n\n3.\u2003Player 3: \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2003\u25aa\u2003That conflicts directly with my established fact that Player 6 is criminal. So Player 3 must be mistaken (whether by being a Rumormonger or Lunatic).\n\n4.\u2003Player 4: \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2003\u25aa\u2003Again, the claim contradicts my known truth. (Thus Player 4\u2014whose Round 1 statement \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal\u201d would have been consistent if the criminal is Player 6\u2014now appears to be giving a false statement. Since only Investigators always tell the truth, Player 4 cannot be an Investigator.)\n\n5.\u2003Player 5: \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2003\u25aa\u2003This agrees with my Round 1 established fact. So Player 5\u2019s statements are entirely consistent with being truthful (and, hence, with being an Investigator).\n\n6.\u2003Player 6: \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2003\u25aa\u2003Even though Player 6 is the Criminal (as per my Round 1 statement) and is free to say anything, his statement agrees with the truth we already have from my statement in Round 2. (However, criminals may choose to tell a truth sometimes, so we cannot use his statement to decide his role beyond what we already know.)\n\nNow, let\u2019s summarize our stand on roles based solely on the need for Investigators to be consistently truthful:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003I (Player 1) am an Investigator.\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Player 5 has made only truthful statements (both in Round 1 and Round 2) and is therefore behaving like an Investigator.\n\u2003\u2022\u2003At least one other player should be the third Investigator because the game calls for three\u2014but note that Players 2, 3, and 4 have each given a claim that conflicts with the fact that Player 6 is criminal. (Player 2\u2019s claim is false in both rounds; Players 3 and 4 each have produced one true and one false statement.)\n\nBecause my role is confirmed by what I\u2019ve been told and by my own truthful declarations, and because I must trust my Round 1 statement as an Investigator, the only consistent conclusion is that Player 6 is indeed the criminal. (The remaining discrepancies in others\u2019 statements then indicate they are either the Rumormonger or the Lunatic. In this round the numbers show that only two players\u2014myself and Player 5\u2014are behaving fully truthfully; the third Investigator must be among the remaining players but none could be verifying the \u201ccriminal\u201d claim correctly, so the only answer that avoids contradicting my known Investigator status is to hold on to the fact that my own statements are beyond doubt.)\n\nTherefore, based on all statements (and given that as Player 1 I must remain confident in my truthfulness), my judgment after Round 2 is:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 6.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

That means at the time of each round I was compelled to state, on the basis of the evidence available then, what I believed with certainty.

In other words, my earlier round\u2010statements represent my initial inferences, while later rounds let me \u201ccorrect course\u201d in light of conflicting testimony.)\n\nLet\u2019s briefly review the rounds:\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nRound 1  \n\u2022\u2003P1 (me) said, \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2022\u2003Other players made statements accusing or defending certain players.  \nAt that point I believed that available evidence required that P6 must be the criminal.

Still, with only these rounds I kept P6 in mind as suspect.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nRound 3  \n\u2022\u2003I now say \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal.\u201d (A clear reversal relative to Round\u202f1.)  \n\u2022\u2003Examining Round\u00a03 independently:  \n\u2003\u2013 P2 says \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2013 P3 says \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal\u201d (consistent with my Investigator status).  \n\u2003\u2013 P4\u2014whose testimony later appears suspect\u2014says \u201cPlayer 1 is the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2013 P5 says \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2013 P6 says \u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal.\u201d  \nWhen tallying the Round\u00a03 claims, three \u201caccusation votes\u201d emerge:  \n\u2003\u2022\u2003P4 is accused by P5;  \n\u2003\u2022\u2003P5 is accused by P6; and  \n\u2003\u2022\u2003P1 is accused by P4.  \nMeanwhile P1, P2, and P3 affirm that P6, P4, and P1 (respectively) are not criminal. (I know I cannot be the criminal, and an Investigator\u2019s own declaration is necessarily true.)  \n\nAmong these, note that P5 is not defended in Round\u00a03 (only P6\u2019s statement accuses P5), and when I compare all rounds the balance of accusations (and later reconsideration of earlier evidence) now most strongly points to Player 5 as fulfilling the role of the criminal. In short, although my Round\u00a01 belief had favored P6, the weight of evidence from Rounds 2 and especially 3, as well as the pattern of conflicting testimony from players known not to be Investigators, convinces me that my initial inference needed revision.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nFinal Synthesis\n\nI (P1) am committed to truth. In Round\u00a03 I was forced by the cumulative evidence to retract my earlier assertion about P6. Instead, the statements\u2014even though some may come out accidentally true from non\u2010Investigators\u2014are best reconciled if we conclude that the criminal is Player 5. (For example, notice that in Round\u00a03 the only candidate receiving multiple independent \u201caccusations\u201d without consistent defense is P5.) Also, the other players\u2019 statements now sort into a pattern consistent with three always-truthful Investigators (P1, P2, and P3) while the remaining players (including criminal P5, plus a Rumormonger and a Lunatic) need not be consistent.\n\nThus, updating my conclusion in light of all rounds, my final judgment is:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 5.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

In Round 1 and Round 2 I stated \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal,\u201d and in Round 3 I said \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d These declarations definitively rule out Players 4 and 5 as the criminal.\n\n2. Now, consider the other rounds\u2019 information:\n\u2003\u2022 In Round 2, three players (Players 1, 4, and 5) made statements that, if truthful, point to \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal\u201d (Player 4 and Player 5 both assert that directly, and if they are genuine Investigators then they must be truthful).  \n\u2003\u2022 In Round 1, Player 3 said \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal\u201d while Player 4 said \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal.\u201d Since I trust my own role, I lean on the pattern that the genuine Investigators (of which there are exactly three) are consistently truthful. It is natural then to assume that Players 1, 4, and 5 are the Investigators.\n\u2003\u2022 Under that assumption, the truth\u2010tellers must declare the criminal correctly. In Round 2, both Player 4 and Player 5 state that \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal,\u201d and there is no contradiction in their statements.\n\u2003\u2022 In Round 3, the Investigators (Players 1, 4, and 5) again are consistent\u2014they state that neither Player 5 (by me and Player 3) nor Player 1 (by Players 4 and 5) is the criminal.  \n\u2003\u2022 Meanwhile, Player 2 and Player 6 give statements that conflict with this picture (for example, in Round 3 Player 2 accuses Player 4 and Player 6 accuses Player 1), which is allowable since only genuine Investigators are bound to truthfulness. Other roles (Criminal, Rumormonger, or Lunatic) may mix truths and falsehoods.\n\n3. With Players 4 and 5 ruled out, and a consistent set of truthful statements from what we believe are the three legitimate Investigators (Players 1, 4, and 5), the only candidate left among the non-Investigators is Player 6. (Player 2\u2019s statements in various rounds are inconsistent, but they never claim a fact that would force him to be the criminal given the truthful statements from our assumed Investigators.)\n\n4. Thus, combining all rounds, the deductions strongly support that Player 6 is the criminal, with Players 1, 4, and 5 as the truthful Investigators\u2014and Players 2 and 3 being the others (Rumormonger and Lunatic) whose statements can be erratic.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 6.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

Lunatics, on the other hand, are told they are Criminals. Because our Round\u20112 statements (and the others from other players) seem hard to reconcile if we truly were the criminal\u2014as the \u201cobjective\u201d truth would force all correct investigator statements to single out the actual criminal (and then every investigator would have to say that \u201cPlayer 1 is criminal\u201d when asked about him, yet no one does)\u2014we must consider that perhaps what we were told (\u201cyou are Criminal\u201d) is not a reflection of reality but a feature of our role if we are Lunatic.\n\nAssume now that the actual criminal is not Player 1. We then need to assign roles to the other five players into 3 Investigators (always truthful), 1 Rumormonger (thinks they\u2019re an Investigator but may be mistaken), and 1 Lunatic (who believes they\u2019re Criminal). A careful look at the statements helps us test a candidate.\n\nOne consistent assignment is as follows (with the \u201cground truth\u201d being that Player 3 is the criminal):\n\n\u2022 Actual Criminal: Player 3.\n\u2022 Investigators (who must always respond truthfully about the fact that the criminal is Player 3):\n\u2003\u2013 In Round 1, an investigator asked about someone other than Player 3 must say \u201cnot criminal.\u201d In Round 2, when not asked about Player 3 directly, the answer should be \u201cnot criminal.\u201d\n\u2003Looking at the statements:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 P4 in Round 1 said \u201cPlayer 3 is the criminal\u201d \u2192 That is correct if P3 is indeed criminal.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 P5 in Round 1 said \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal\u201d \u2192 True.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 P6 in Round 1 said \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal\u201d \u2192 True.\n\u2003\u2003Also in Round 2:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 P4 said \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal\u201d \u2192 True.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 P5 said \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal\u201d \u2192 True.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 P6 said \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal\u201d \u2192 True.\n\u2003Thus, it is very natural to assign the three Investigators to Players 4, 5, and 6.\n\n\u2022 Now, among the remaining players, we have P1 and P2 left for the roles of Lunatic and Rumormonger. Notice:\n\u2003\u2013 P1 (us) was told we are Criminal. If we were truly the Criminal, then the Investigator statements (which must name the true criminal) would have been different. In our current assignment, the unanimous truthful statements of P4, P5, and P6 imply that neither Player 1 nor Player 2 is the criminal.\n\u2003\u2013 For consistency, our own Round 1 statement (\u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal\u201d) is false and our Round 2 statement (\u201cPlayer 3 is the criminal\u201d) turns out true. A Lunatic (who believes they are Criminal) is allowed to be erratic in truthfulness.\n\u2003Thus it fits that we (Player 1) are the Lunatic.\n\u2003\u2013 That leaves Player 2 as the Rumormonger. Check Player 2\u2019s statements:\n\u2003\u2003Round 1: \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal.\u201d This is false given our candidate (P3 is criminal).\n\u2003\u2003Round 2: \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal.\u201d Again false.\n\u2003A Rumormonger, misled by their belief that they are an Investigator, can indeed provide incorrect statements.\n\n\u2022 Finally, check Player 3. As the actual Criminal, they have freedom:\n\u2003Round 1: \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal.\u201d (True, but the criminal can choose truth or lie.)\n\u2003Round 2: \u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal.\u201d (False.)\n\u2003That is acceptable.\n\nAll statements now are consistent with:\n\u2003Criminal = Player 3,\n\u2003Investigators = Players 4, 5, 6,\n\u2003Rumormonger = Player 2,\n\u2003Lunatic = Player 1 (ourselves).\n\nThus, even though we were told \u201cyou are Criminal,\u201d the overall information forces the conclusion that the actual criminal is Player 3 and our true role is Lunatic.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 3.\nMy Role Is Lunatic."

As Player\u00a01, I am an Investigator and therefore my statement that \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal\u201d must be true. That immediately tells me that Player\u00a02 cannot be the criminal.\n\n\u2022 Looking at the remaining statements:\n\u2003\u2013 Player\u00a02 says \u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2013 Player\u00a03 says \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d (This is uncontroversial since I am not criminal.)\n\u2003\u2013 Player\u00a04 says \u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal.\u201d Since we know P2 is not criminal, this statement is false.\n\u2003\u2013 Player\u00a05 says \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2013 Player\u00a06 says \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Because only Investigators always tell the truth, I must determine which set of three players (besides me) could be the truth\u2011tellers. In one plausible scenario the true Investigators are Players\u00a01, 2, and 3. Under that assumption the following holds:\n\u2003\u2013 P1\u2019s statement tells us P2 is not criminal.\n\u2003\u2013 P2\u2019s statement \u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal\u201d is then truthful.\n\u2003\u2013 P3\u2019s statement is likewise truthful.\nIn that scenario the criminal would be Player\u00a05. (Players whose statements are false \u2013 here P4 and P6 \u2013 would be either the Lunatic or the Rumormonger, both of whom can make false statements.)\n\n\u2022 Although alternate possibilities exist (for example, if Player\u00a06 were truthful instead of Player\u00a02, it would suggest a different criminal), the simplest and most consistent set based solely on Round 1 is that Players\u00a01, 2, and 3 are the Investigators. Thus, I lean toward the conclusion that Player\u00a05 is the criminal.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, here is my Round 1 Final Judgment:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 5.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

I already know I (P1) am one Investigator. We have five other players, where exactly two more must be Investigators. (The remaining three non\u2011Investigator players are one Criminal, one Rumormonger, and one Lunatic.)\n\nLooking at the conflicting statements about Player 5:\n\u2003\u2022 In Round 1, P2 accuses Player 5 while P6 defends Player 5.\n\u2003\u2022 In Round 2, P3 states \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d\nIf we suppose that an Investigator is among these conflicting voices, their statement must be correct. Note that if P2 were an Investigator then his Round 1 claim \u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal\u201d would force Player 5 to be criminal. But then P3\u2019s Round 2 statement \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal\u201d (if he were also an Investigator) would be false\u2014a contradiction. Likewise, if P6 (whom I already ruled out as criminal by my round\u20102 statement) were Investigator, his Round 1 \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal\u201d would be true. This pushes us to consider that P3 might be the Investigator: if so, his Round 2 statement means that Player 5 is not criminal. \n\nSo consider the following candidate assignment:\n\u2003\u2022 Investigators: P1 (me), P3, and P6.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Their statements:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003- P1: \u201cP2 is not criminal\u201d and \u201cP6 is not criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2003\u2003- P3: \u201cPlayer 1 is not criminal\u201d (Round 1) and \u201cPlayer 5 is not criminal\u201d (Round 2).\n\u2003\u2003\u2003- P6: \u201cPlayer 5 is not criminal\u201d (Round 1) and \u201cPlayer 1 is not criminal\u201d (Round 2).\n\u2003\u2003All these are consistent with known facts.\n\u2003\u2022 Then, among the remaining players (P2, P4, P5):\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 We already know from my statement and the Investigator set that neither P2 nor P6 is criminal.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 P2\u2019s Round 1 claim \u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal\u201d must be mistaken if he is not an Investigator.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 P5\u2019s Round 1 \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal\u201d becomes suspect if the criminal turns out to be Player 4.\n\u2003\u2003Thus, the only candidate left for Criminal is Player 4.\n\u2003\u2022 The remaining roles (Rumormonger and Lunatic) can be assigned to P2 and P5 in any order, which is acceptable because their statements can be arbitrary.\n\nUnder this assignment the statements check out:\n\u2003\u2013 P1 (I): Truthful.\n\u2003\u2013 P3 (I) & P6 (I): Their statements confirm that neither Player 1 nor Player 5 is criminal.\n\u2003\u2013 P4 (C): Made a false statement (\u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal\u201d) in Round 1 and a correct one (\u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal\u201d) in Round 2\u2014but as Criminal he is free to mix truth and lies.\n\u2003\u2013 P2 and P5 (non\u2011I): Their mistaken or arbitrary statements are acceptable.\n\nThis assignment satisfies the requirement of three Investigators (P1, P3, P6), a single Criminal (P4), a Rumormonger and a Lunatic (P2 and P5 in some order).\n\nBased on the combined rounds, my updated judgment is:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 4.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

Let\u2019s review consistency in the other players\u2019 statements across both rounds.\n\n\u2022 Player 2 consistently claims \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal\u201d (in both Round 1 and Round 2). If Player 2 is an Investigator then this claim would be truthful.\n\n\u2022 Player 3 in Round 1 said \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal\u201d and in Round 2 said \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d Since I know for sure I am not criminal, the second part of Player 3\u2019s Round 2 statement is true, but their Round 1 statement contradicts my true statement that Player 6 is not criminal.

Here are the key points:\n\n\u2022 My statement (\u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal\u201d) must be true, so Player 5 is definitely not the Criminal.\n\u2022 Players 2 and 3 accuse one another\u2014one says \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal\u201d while the other says \u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal.\u201d Since only genuine Investigators always tell the truth, it means that at most one of these two can be an Investigator.\n\u2022 Player 4 accuses me (\u201cPlayer 1 is the criminal\u201d). Because I know I\u2019m an Investigator and cannot be the Criminal, Player 4\u2019s statement must be false. This rules out Player 4 as a genuine Investigator.\n\nNow, one workable way to make sense of the puzzle is as follows. Suppose that Player 3 is a genuine Investigator. Then when he says, \u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal,\u201d that statement must be true. In that case:\n\u2003\u2013 The Criminal is Player 2.\n\u2003\u2013 Player 3 (and me, Player 1) are telling the truth.\n\u2003\u2013 Player 5\u2019s statement that \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal\u201d is also true (and it fits, since the Criminal is Player 2).\n\u2003\u2013 That leaves Players 4, 6, and Player 2 to have roles among the Criminal, Rumormonger, and Lunatic. In this scenario, Player 2 would be the Criminal, and Players 4 and 6 would be the non\u2010investigator roles (one being Rumormonger and the other Lunatic), whose statements can be arbitrary.\n\nWhile an alternate possibility might have been that Player 2 were the genuine Investigator (accusing Player 6), the overall picture fits more consistently if we place the Criminal as Player 2. (This is especially so because Player 4\u2019s false accusation against me and the need to have three consistent Investigator voices pushes Player 3 into that truthful Investigator role.)\n\nBased solely on Round 1 statements, my best (though not yet 100% final) conclusion is:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 2.\nMy Role Is Investigator.\n\nI\u2019ll be on the lookout in the next round for extra confirmation or clues that might require me to shift my conclusions."

That means any statement asserting someone else is criminal (or asserting that I am not criminal) should be false if it came from an Investigator. (Investigators are not allowed to lie.)\n\nExamine each statement under the hypothesis \u201cPlayer 1 is Criminal\u201d:\n\u2003\u2013 My own (Player 1) statement can be arbitrarily made and so is uninformative.\n\u2003\u2013 Player 2 claims \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal.\u201d This would be false.\n\u2003\u2013 Player 3 claims \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d This is false.\n\u2003\u2013 Player 4 claims \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d Again false.\n\u2003\u2013 Player 5 claims \u201cPlayer 3 is the criminal.\u201d False.\n\u2003\u2013 Player 6 claims \u201cPlayer 3 is the criminal.\u201d False.\n\nHowever, exactly three players in the game must be Investigators\u2014and an Investigator\u2019s statement is always perfectly truthful. Under the assumption that I am the Criminal, none of the statements from Players 2\u20136 would be true. That means none of them could be Investigators. This is a contradiction with the game rules.\n\nConclusion from Combined Analysis:\n\u2022 Round 1 (from previous round) could be arranged consistently if I were Criminal by having Players 2, 3, and 6 be the truth\u2010tellers and hence the Investigators.\n\u2022 But in Round 2 every statement (from Players 2\u20136) is inconsistent with a world in which I am Criminal\u2014the fact that all of them point at someone else (or say I am not Criminal) means none of them would be truth\u2010tellers. That violates the rule that exactly three must be Investigators.\n\nTherefore, given the game\u2019s fundamental requirement that there are three investigators who always speak truthfully, the set of Round 2 statements is inconsistent with the information I was given (that I am Criminal).\n\nSince I cannot resolve this contradiction within the rules, I do not have sufficient confidence in deducing a final answer consistent with all rounds.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player Unknown.\nMy Role Is Unknown."

Although a Criminal\u2019s statements can be arbitrary, the other players\u2019 statements must be examined under the fact that the actual Criminal is Player 1.\n\nLet\u2019s review the Round 3 statements while using the fact that Player 1 is the Criminal:\n\n\u2022 Player 1 says, \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003As the Criminal, my statement can be true or false at will.\n\n\u2022 Player 2 says, \u201cPlayer 1 is the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003If Player 1 is indeed the Criminal, then this statement is true. (An Investigator would always tell the truth, so Player 2 is a candidate for being one of the three Investigators.)\n\n\u2022 Player 3 says, \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003This statement is false when Player 1 is the Criminal. Thus, Player 3 cannot be an Investigator; he must be either the Rumormonger or the Lunatic.\n\n\u2022 Player 4 says, \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003Since Player 1 is the Criminal, Player 5 is indeed not the criminal, and this statement is true. (Player 4 is likely an Investigator, unless by chance a non\u2010Investigator happens to state a true fact.)\n\n\u2022 Player 5 says, \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003With Player 1 as Criminal, Player 2 is not the Criminal, so this statement is true.

(Player 6 is a candidate for being an Investigator as well.)\n\nNow, under the condition that exactly three players (other than me, who is the Criminal) are Investigators, we see that Players 2, 4, 5, and 6 all make true statements. However, since only three should be Investigators, one of these players must be either the Rumormonger or the Lunatic who coincidentally provided a true statement this round. Meanwhile, Player 3\u2019s statement is false, so he clearly is not an Investigator.\n\nThere is no contradiction with the information that I am the Criminal. The truthful statements about \u201cwho is not the criminal\u201d or \u201cwho is the criminal\u201d are all consistent with Player 1 being the Criminal. Although the exact identification of the other roles (which three are actual Investigators versus which one is the Rumormonger or Lunatic) remains ambiguous from this round alone, our focus is on confirming the criminal and my own role.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

Here\u2019s what we have:\n\n\u2022\u2003Player 1 (myself) says \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal.\u201d Being an Investigator, I know for sure that Player 6 is indeed innocent.\n\u2022\u2003Player 2 says \u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal.\u201d If Player 2 were an Investigator then this claim must be true; if not, then this could be misleading.\n\u2022\u2003Player 3 says \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d This is consistent with what I know about myself and is exactly what an Investigator must say.\n\u2022\u2003Player 4 says \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d Again, if Player 4 is an Investigator then this statement is truthful.\n\u2022\u2003Player 5 says \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d (Without knowing Player 5\u2019s role we cannot be sure if this is a truthful assertion by an Investigator or a misleading/non\u2010investigator claim.)\n\u2022\u2003Player 6 says \u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal.\u201d Since I know Player 6 is not the criminal (from my own trustworthy statement as an Investigator), his statement about who it actually is might be arbitrary if he is not Investigator\u2014or if he were an Investigator his statement would be true. \n\nAt this point there is a conflict. On the one hand Player 2 accuses Player 5, and on the other Player 6 accuses Player 2. Because Investigators are the only role that always tells the truth, one guiding idea is that if one of these speakers is an Investigator, then their claim must be correct. \n\nConsider one plausible assignment:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Assume that Players 1, 3, and 4 are the three Investigators.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Then Player 1\u2019s \u201cPlayer 6 is not criminal\u201d is true.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Player 3\u2019s \u201cPlayer 1 is not criminal\u201d is true.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 And Player 4\u2019s \u201cPlayer 5 is not criminal\u201d is true.\n\u2003In that case the criminal cannot be Player 5; rather, Player 2\u2019s accusation (\u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal\u201d) must be false. \n\u2003Also, Player 6\u2019s statement, \u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal,\u201d if coming from a non\u2010investigator (either the Criminal, the Rumormonger, or the Lunatic) might coincidentally be true. Here the possibility is that Player 2 is indeed the Criminal.\n\nNow consider an alternate possibility:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Assume instead that Players 1, 2, and 3 are the Investigators.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Then Player 2\u2019s claim (\u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal\u201d) must be true.\n\u2003In this scenario, however, Player 4\u2019s statement (\u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal\u201d) is a clear falsehood, so Player 4 cannot be an Investigator. Also Player 6\u2019s statement (\u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal\u201d) would then be false even if he happens to say a truthful statement by chance.\nBoth assignments can be internally consistent when allowing non-Investigators (Criminal, Rumormonger, Lunatic) the latitude of saying things that might be true or false.\n\nAt Round 1 the information does not definitively resolve which possibility is correct. However, a weighing of the statements suggests more internal consistency if we lean toward the possibility that the contradictory accusations indicate the criminal is Player 2 (since then the statement from an Investigator\u2014if Player 6 happened to be a non\u2010investigator\u2014could accidentally be true, while Player 2\u2019s own statement as the criminal would be a deliberate misdirection).\n\nThus at this stage, my working conclusion is:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 2.\nMy Role Is Investigator. \n\nThis is my best assessment after the first round based on the available statements."

In Round 2, Player 2\u2019s \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal\u201d is also consistent.\n\u2022 Player 3, however, in Round 2 said \u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal\u201d which would be false if Player 5 is the criminal. (Plus, in Round 1 he said \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal\u201d which is true.)  \n\u2003\u2003This means Player 3 is not one of those always telling the truth.\n\u2022 Player 4 in Round 1 said \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal\u201d which is false under our assumption. In Round 2 his \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal\u201d is true, so he isn\u2019t consistently truthful.\n\u2022 Player 6 in Round 1 said \u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal\u201d (false if Player 5 is criminal) and in Round 2 said \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal\u201d (again false).\n\nAmong the six players (recall there are 3 Investigators, 1 Criminal, 1 Rumormonger, and 1 Lunatic) and knowing I\u2019m truly an Investigator:\n\u2022 The only players who have spoken in two rounds in a completely Investigator\u2010consistent way are Player\u202f1 (myself) and Player\u202f2.\n\u2022 Although we need three Investigators, the remaining one (\u201cInvestigator\u201d in belief) could be the Rumormonger (who is told they are an Investigator even though they may sometimes be mistaken).\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nConclusion:\n\nBecause I must always tell the truth, my Round 2 statement \u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal\u201d sets the fact that Player 5 is indeed the criminal. The other players\u2019 inconsistent statements further support that the true criminal is not being reliably pointed out by everyone else.\n\nThus, based on all rounds so far:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 5.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

I (Player 1) have been told I am the Criminal. (Note that Criminals may choose to make statements either truthfully or falsely to mislead.)\n\n3.

Several points to note:\n\u2003\u2013 Investigators always give a correct answer about who the criminal actually is. If Players 2, 3, or 5 are genuine Investigators, then their statements would be true. In that scenario, \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal\u201d (said by Players 2 and 5) would be correct and \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal\u201d (said by Player 3) would be correct.\n\u2003\u2013 Player 6\u2019s statement that \u201cPlayer 1 is the criminal\u201d would be factually correct, which is exactly what it is.\n\u2003\u2013 Meanwhile, my own statement (as Player 1, the Criminal) that \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal\u201d may be a deliberate misdirection.\n\u2003\u2013 Player 4, saying \u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal,\u201d could be either misleading (if not an Investigator) or mistaken (if a Rumormonger or Lunatic).\n\n5. What does this tell us so far?\n\u2003\u2013 If we trust that any Investigators are speaking truthfully, the statements from Players 2, 3, 5, and 6 are all consistent with the fact that I (Player 1) am the Criminal (since they all deny someone else being the criminal or point to the known fact).\n\u2003\u2013 My own statement appears to be a lie or misdirection \u2013 which is acceptable given my role.\n\u2003\u2013 Without additional rounds to clearly pinpoint which players are truly Investigators versus Rumormongers or the Lunatic, what we can confidently conclude from Round 1 is:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 The valid \u201ctruthful\u201d statements (if coming from Investigators) support that Player 4 and Player 6 are not criminals, and that Player 1 is the criminal.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 This fits with my assignment as Criminal.\n\nBased on Round 1 alone, my best conclusion is:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal.\n\nThis is the judgment after Round 1 with the available information."

P2 says \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal\u201d in Round 2 and also \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal\u201d in Round 1. Both statements align with me (P1) being the criminal, so P2\u2019s statements remain consistently correct.\n4. P4 and P5 maintain accusations (P4 always saying \u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal\u201d and P5 switching between \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal\u201d and \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal\u201d), which do not align perfectly with the known fact that I am the Criminal.

Other players (P3, P4, P5, and P6) have inconsistencies that suggest some of them are either Rumormongers or the Lunatic\u2014roles that do not provide entirely reliable information.\n\u2022 There is no round of statements here that contradicts the fact I have been assigned the Criminal role.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nFinal Conclusion After Round 2:\nSince I know my own role and the statements of those expected to tell the truth (such as P2) reinforce the fact that the criminal is indeed Player 1, the final judgment is:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

In Round 2, I stated \u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal.\u201d Therefore, by my role I must accept that Player 2 is indeed the criminal.\n\n2.

In order to meet the game requirement of having three Investigators (truthful speakers), exactly one more player out of 3, 4, or 5 would need to be an Investigator. But each of them made statements that conflict with what we now know (since they falsely claim that Player 6 is the criminal or that I am the criminal).\n\n3. Although the count of Investigators seems to tip toward having only two truth\u2010tellers (myself and Player 6), the key point for me is that as an Investigator I must speak truthfully; therefore, my statement \u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal\u201d must be correct. (The inconsistencies in others\u2019 statements suggest that the non\u2010Investigator roles\u2014the Criminal (Player 2), Rumormonger, and Lunatic\u2014are producing misleading or mistaken claims.)\n\nBased on my required truthfulness and the necessity to conclude one and only one criminal, I must trust that Player 2 is the criminal.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 2.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

An Investigator\u2019s statements must be truthful. Since the true Criminal is Player\u202f1, any correct statement by an Investigator about who is or isn\u2019t Criminal must reflect that:\n\u2003\u2022 \u201cX is the criminal\u201d is only true if X = 1.\n\u2003\u2022 \u201cY is not the criminal\u201d is only true if Y \u2260 1.\n\n2. Examining each Round 3 statement with the assumption that Player 1 is Criminal:\n\u2003\u2022 My statement (\u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal\u201d) is in fact true because Player 4 is not criminal. (As Criminal I can say true or false.)\n\u2003\u2022 Player 2 says \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal.\u201d This is false.\n\u2003\u2022 Player 3 says \u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal.\u201d This is false.\n\u2003\u2022 Player 4 says \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal.\u201d This is false.\n\u2003\u2022 Player 5 says \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d That is false, since I am the criminal.\n\u2003\u2022 Player 6 says \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d That is true, because Player 5 indeed is not criminal.\n\n3. For a statement to come from an Investigator the content must be true. In Round 3 under the assumption that I am Criminal, only the statements by Player 1, and Player 6 are clearly \u201ctrue.\u201d (Recall that I know my own role and thus my statement is not bound by the truth requirement\u2014but I happen to have stated a fact that is true.) In contrast, Players 2, 3, 4, and 5 made statements that contradict the known fact (if I assume I am Criminal).\n\n4. At first glance Round 3 appears puzzling because we must have three Investigators among Players 2\u20136. In Round 2, however, the majority of statements were in line with the truth (with players stating things such as \u201cPlayer 1 is the criminal\u201d and \u201cPlayer X is not the criminal\u201d when appropriate). It appears that in Round 3 several players (perhaps the Rumormonger and the Lunatic, who are allowed to be misleading) have chosen to make false claims. It is clear that an Investigator would never falsely pinpoint someone other than Player 1 as the Criminal. \n\n5. Given that my earlier rounds consistently support that the only Criminal is Player 1\u2014and I have been told I am Criminal\u2014I must conclude that the truth remains unchanged. The unusual claims in Round 3 appear to be coming from non\u2010Investigator roles (or are strategic misdirections from those whose roles do not force them to be truthful).\n\nThus, despite the conflicting Round 3 statements, incorporating the full game history and knowing my own role, my conclusion is:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

(Player 3 must be either a Rumormonger or a Lunatic.)\n\n\u2022 Player 4 says \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 That is true (Player 1 is the criminal). However, note that in Round 2 Player 4 stated \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal\u201d (a false claim). Since genuine Investigators are always truthful, Player 4\u2019s overall record is inconsistent. Hence, Player 4 must not be a genuine Investigator (thus a Rumormonger or Lunatic).\n\n\u2022 Player 5 says \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 This is false. (So Player 5 cannot be an Investigator.)\n\n\u2022 Player 6 says \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 This false claim also shows that Player 6 cannot be a genuine Investigator.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nRecap from All Rounds:\n\n\u2022 I (Player 1) know my role is Criminal.\n\n\u2022 In earlier rounds, similar patterns emerged:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Several players (Players 3, 4, 5, and 6) have at least one statement that is false when measured against the fact that Player 1 is criminal.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Only Player 2 has consistently given statements that are fully in line with the truth.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nWhat Does This Tell Us?\n\nThe game setup requires there be 3 Investigators. Investigators always speak truthfully. In our analysis across rounds, only Player 2 shows evidence of always stating correct information. All of the others (Players 3, 4, 5, and 6) have made at least one false statement \u2013 meaning they are not genuine Investigators. (They must be the Rumormonger or Lunatic, whose statements can be unreliable.)\n\nWhile the distribution tells us there should be three genuine Investigators, the inconsistency in most players\u2019 statements forces the conclusion (based solely on consistency) that Player 2 is the only one whose statements match what is expected from a genuine Investigator. \n\nRegardless, since I know my role, and all rounds point to the fact that the Criminal is actually Player 1 (me), the verdict is clear. (As Criminal, I was free to switch my assertions from round to round, and my own statements do not constrain the truth.)\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nFinal Judgment:\n\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

Yet looking at my own rounds:\n\u2022 In Round 1, I stated that Player 2 is not the criminal.\n\u2022 In Round 2, I stated that Player 5 is the criminal.\n\u2022 In Round 3, I stated that Player 2 is the criminal.\n\nAn Investigator cannot change a known fact. Under the assumption that each round is meant to provide new information yet refer to one fixed underlying reality, any Investigator\u2019s statements would remain consistent from round to round. Hence, the conflict between my Round 1 and Round 3 statements creates a contradiction.\n\nIn these social deduction puzzles the statements of Investigators are our \u201canchors\u201d (because we know they are truthful). Faced with contradictory evidence, I must treat the most recent (final\u2010round) declaration as the final resolution of my investigation. That is, if by Round 3 I have new evidence compelling me to update my judgment, then\u2014as my role is that of an Investigator\u2014I must now conclude the truth is what I state in Round 3.\n\nSo although my earlier rounds presented different candidate criminals (and indeed other players\u2019 messages also conflict), the requirements of the game rule \u201conly Investigators provide consistently truthful information\u201d means that my statement in the final round must be correct. (This is admittedly odd given the earlier rounds, but my role as Investigator forces that my final round claim is the current\u2014and ultimately correct\u2014finding.)\n\nAdditionally:\n\u2022 In Round 3, P2 again says \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal\u201d (consistent with me knowing my own innocence).\n\u2022 Although other players\u2019 statements differ (for example, P6 in Round 3 also claims \u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal\u201d), the single fact that my final-round statement (as a truthful Investigator) is \u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal\u201d forces the conclusion.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nFinal Judgment\n\nFinal Criminal Is Player 2.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

But we must remember that exactly three genuine Investigators exist in the game, so the other two not caught making mistakes (in Round 1) might yet be genuine\u2014but we must check consistency with the next round.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nRound 2 Analysis:\n\u2022 P1: \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal.\u201d \u2013 As Criminal, I can misdirect arbitrarily.\n\u2022 P2: \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d \u2013 Again, that agrees with the fact (I am the criminal) and is truthful.\n\u2022 P3: \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d \u2013 Correct statement (Player 4 is not criminal if I am).\n\u2022 P4: \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal.\u201d \u2013 False.\n\u2022 P5: \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal.\u201d \u2013 False.\n\u2022 P6: \u201cPlayer 3 is the criminal.\u201d \u2013 False.\n\nLooking at Round 2:\n\u2013 Only P2 and P3 offered statements that coincide with what is actually true (since I know my identity as Criminal, any claim that someone else is criminal is false).\n\u2013 The remaining players (P4, P5, and P6) gave statements that are clearly false in Round 2.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nCross-Round Consistency Check:\nCombine the rounds (knowing that genuine Investigators must always be correct):\n\u2022 Player 2: True in R1 and true in R2 (consistent with an Investigator).\n\u2022 Player 3: True in R2 but false in R1 \u2013 cannot be a genuine Investigator.\n\u2022 Player 4: True in R1 but false in R2 \u2013 cannot be a genuine Investigator.\n\u2022 Player 5: True in R1 but false in R2 \u2013 cannot be a genuine Investigator.\n\u2022 Player 6: True in R1 but false in R2 \u2013 cannot be a genuine Investigator.\n\nThus only Player 2 is completely consistent with the behavior of an Investigator. (We know there must be 3 Investigators, but this tells me that despite a player\u2019s Round\u00a01 truthfulness, any instance of a false claim (as seen for P3, P4, P5 or P6) disqualifies them from being a genuine Investigator.)

None of the rounds suggests otherwise\u2014the truthful statements all align with the fact that the Criminal is Player 1.

But since I know I am the Criminal, an Investigator could not say Player 5 is criminal. Therefore, Player 2 is not one of the truthful Investigators. (Player 2 might be the Rumormonger or the Lunatic, whose statements do not have to be reliably correct.)\n\n3. Player 3 said \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 With me as the Criminal, this statement is correct. So if Player 3 is an Investigator, this fits. (Alternatively, Player 3 might be someone who happens to say the truth this round even if they aren\u2019t an Investigator.)\n\n4. Player 4 said \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Given that I am the Criminal, this statement is correct.

If Player 5 were an Investigator, they would always tell the truth. So Player 5 could well be an Investigator (or, again, possibly a non-Investigator who happened to be correct this round).\n\n6. Player 6 said \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 This is also a correct statement given that I am the Criminal.

This suggests Player 2 is likely either the Rumormonger or the Lunatic.\n\u2022 I, as Player 1 (the Criminal), have given a false statement by accusing Player 2.\n\nEven though several players have given statements that align with the fact that I am Criminal, there is some ambiguity since the Rumormonger and Lunatic might also occasionally say the \u201ctruth.\u201d With the assignment of roles (3 Investigators, 1 Criminal, 1 Rumormonger, 1 Lunatic) and my role being known to me as Criminal, a likely scenario is that Players 3, 4, and 5 are our three Investigators (all giving correct info about who is or isn\u2019t the criminal), while Players 2 and possibly 6 fill the slots of Rumormonger and Lunatic. (Player 6\u2019s statement, though true, may be incidental.)\n\nBased solely on Round 1 information, the most consistent conclusion is that I am indeed the Criminal.

Since I know (by my \u201ctold\u201d role) that I am the Criminal, an Investigator must say \u201cPlayer 1 is the criminal\u201d if they refer to the criminal. Let\u2019s check each statement under that assumption:\n\n1. I (Player 1) say \u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003As the Criminal, I can lie or tell the truth arbitrarily. (No constraint here.)\n\n2. Player 2 says \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003But if I truly am the Criminal, an Investigator would have to say \u201cPlayer 1 is the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003Thus if Player 2 were an Investigator they would have spoken truthfully; here the statement is false.  \n\u2003\u2003So Player 2 cannot be one of the three consistently truthful Investigators.\n\n3. Player 3 says \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003With me as Criminal, that statement is correct.  \n\u2003\u2003So Player 3\u2019s statement fits what an Investigator would say (if citing someone other than the criminal, they must claim correctly that person is not criminal).\n\n4. Player 4 says \u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003That is false if I am the Criminal.  \n\u2003\u2003Thus Player 4 cannot be an Investigator.\n\n5. Player 5 says \u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003Again false under the assumption that I (Player 1) am Criminal.  \n\u2003\u2003So Player 5 is not an Investigator.\n\n6. Player 6 says \u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003This is also false if I really am the Criminal.  \n\u2003\u2003So Player 6 cannot be an Investigator.\n\nBecause Investigators must always speak correctly about who is or is not criminal, the only statement in Round 2 that matches this requirement is Player 3\u2019s. (Investigators are three in number, but within these six statements only one player clearly states something that is in complete agreement with me being Criminal.)  \n \nThis is a puzzle: If my self\u2010knowledge \u201cI am Criminal\u201d is taken as fixed then any Investigator naming the criminal would have to say \u201cPlayer 1 is the criminal.\u201d Since none of the players except possibly myself (but I cannot count because I\u2019m Criminal) say that, it appears that in Round 2 the three Investigators must be among the other players. Yet Players 2, 4, 5, and 6 all make statements that are inconsistent with me being criminal. The only one whose statement is fully \u201ctruthful\u201d is Player 3. \n\nEven though this disparity leaves ambiguity for the roles of the other players (they could be acting as Rumormonger or Lunatic, whose statements may happen to be false this round), I must rely on my given role. I have been told I am the Criminal. \n\nNo matter how confusing the other statements become in light of the required counts for roles, I know my own role for sure.\n\nThus, based on my self\u2010knowledge and the statements received in Round 2, my final judgment is:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal.\n\nThis is my best conclusion given the available Round 2 information and the game rules."

However, since only three of the six players are genuine Investigators (and I am not one because I am Criminal), it isn\u2019t possible for all four of those players to be Investigators. Rather, only three among them always provide the truth\u2014while a Rumormonger (who believes they are an Investigator) or a Lunatic (who believes they are a Criminal) might accidentally give a correct statement. In any event, none of these rounds produces any indication that someone other than me could actually be the Criminal.\n\nGiven that my self\u2010knowledge is that I am Criminal and all the evidence in every round has been interpreted under that assumption, the only logically consistent final conclusion is that I remain the Criminal.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

Still, a false statement from a non\u2010Investigator does not itself prove guilt.\n\u2003\u2013 The only positive accusation among these comes from Player 6, who says \u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal.\u201d Given that we have at least three trustworthy voices\u2014the ones that definitely exonerate Players 1, 3, and (if we trust Player 2\u2019s statement) 6\u2014and no trustworthy vote for Player 2 or Player 4, the best candidate left as the criminal is Player 5.\n\n\u2022 Based on Round 3\u2019s set of statements (and assuming that the current round\u2019s information is what we base our final judgment on), it is most reasonable to conclude that Player 5 is the criminal.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 5.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

In a world where I am criminal the resulting truth for any claim about someone being \u201cnot the criminal\u201d is that only Player 1 qualifies as criminal. Thus an Investigator would have to say \u201cPlayer 1 is the criminal\u201d when commenting on any suspect.  \n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nInconsistencies and Role Inferences:\n\u2022 In Round 2 none of the players identifies me (Player 1) as criminal. Even those whose statements are factually true (P2, P4, and P5) do not mention me. This is inconsistent with true Investigators, who by the rules should give correct identification (\u201cPlayer 1 is the criminal\u201d).\n\u2022 Thus, in Round 2 it appears that none of the statements follow the strict Investigator pattern. Their \u201ctrue\u201d statements (that \u201cPlayer 4 is not criminal\u201d or \u201cPlayer 2 is not criminal\u201d) are correct but are incomplete with regard to identifying the criminal.\n\u2022 Consequently, it is most plausible that in Round 2 all statements came from roles that may provide misleading (or partially true) information \u2013 that is, from players who are not Investigator. (Investigators, if present in earlier rounds, might now be concealed among Rumormongers whose mistaken beliefs led them to diverge from the expected truth.)\n\u2022 The twist is that despite my initial assignment as Criminal, the reliably truthful Investigator statements should have been obvious, yet both rounds show no one clearly stating \u201cPlayer 1 is the criminal.\u201d\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nOur Judgment:\nEven though the Round 2 statements raise a flag about the proper Investigator behavior, I must combine all available evidence with what I know about my own role. I was told I am Criminal.  \n\u2022 Round 1 had one statement (from P3) that was entirely consistent with an Investigator\u2014but his Round 2 statement contradicts that consistency.\n\u2022 Multiple players in Round 2 are accusing Player 5 of being criminal. Yet, if I am indeed the Criminal then these are false claims (or misled claims), potentially coming from Rumormongers or Lunatics.\n\u2022 There is no reliable evidence provided in Round 2 that contradicts my known role.\n\nThus, even though there is uncertainty about the other players\u2019 roles and the use of factually correct statements that do not follow the full Investigator pattern, the cumulative evidence forces the conclusion:\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

Under the true state that Player 1 is criminal, every Investigator when asked about any other player (2\u20136) must say \u201cnot the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 In Round 3, players 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 give answers that are factually correct. However, an Investigator, if asked about a target, must consistently deliver the truth every round.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 In Rounds 1 and 2 we see several players (P2, P3, P4, P5, and P6) making statements that conflict with what an always-truthful Investigator would say. For example, P2 in Round 1 said \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal\u201d (a lie) and P3 in Round 2 said \u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal\u201d (a lie).\n\n2. Because I know my status as Criminal, the fact that nobody ever states \u201cPlayer 1 is the criminal\u201d in any round is entirely expected from a truthful Investigator\u2014they would have to say \u201cnot the criminal\u201d when discussing any other player.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 All statements that are \u201cnot criminal\u201d (when the target isn\u2019t 1) are factually correct; however, only Investigators are compelled to always state that correctly.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 None of the players show a pattern of being correct in all rounds. That is consistent with the possibility that many are either Rumormongers or Lunatics (who believe they are either Investigators or Criminal respectively) and thus do not have the constraint of always speaking the truth.\n\n3. In almost every round several players give statements that are incorrect regarding the identity of the criminal. None of those correct answers conflict with the established fact: if Player 1 is the criminal, every statement about another player saying \u201cnot the criminal\u201d is factually correct but may be coincidental.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 For instance, in Round 2, players P2, P4, and P5 state \u201cnot the criminal\u201d for their respective targets; while correct, they deviate from the required Investigator response if the target were actually Player 1.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nConclusion:\n\nGiven that my starting information tells me I am Player 1\u2014the Criminal\u2014and all statements across the rounds are consistent with Player 1 being the criminal (in that every statement about a non-Player1 is true or false according to that fact), I see no contradiction or evidence strong enough to suggest otherwise.\n\nThus, based on all rounds combined, I must conclude:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

In Round 2 I stated \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d Therefore, Player 5 is innocent.\n\n2. Let\u2019s review all statements (combining information from Round 1 and Round 2):\n\n\u2003\u2022 From Round 1, I (Player 1) said \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal\u201d \u2013 so Player 3 is innocent.  \n\u2003\u2022 In Round 1, several players (Players 3 and 4) also cleared me, and Player 6 said \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal\u201d \u2013 reinforcing that Player 3 is indeed innocent.\n\n\u2003Round 2 statements:\n\u2003\u2022 Player 2 now says \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2022 Player 3 says \u201cPlayer 1 is the criminal.\u201d Since I know I am not criminal, this is false; therefore, Player 3 cannot be an Investigator (though we already know from Round 1 that Player 3 is innocent).  \n\u2003\u2022 Player 4 says \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal.\u201d This is consistent with Round 1 and known facts.  \n\u2003\u2022 Player 5 (whom I cleared) says \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2022 Player 6 says \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\n3. Notice that Player 2 has given conflicting information between rounds: in Round 1 he claimed \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal\u201d and in Round 2 he claims \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal.\u201d As an Investigator all statements would be truthful, so Player 2 cannot be one. This inconsistency marks him as a non\u2010Investigator (i.e. either Criminal, Rumormonger, or Lunatic).\n\n4. At this point, the set of players ruled out from being criminal by verifiable Investigator testimony (or my own truthful statements) are:\n\u2003\u2022 Player 1 (me) \u2013 Investigator.\n\u2003\u2022 Player 3 \u2013 I have directly stated and others agree he is innocent.\n\u2003\u2022 Player 5 \u2013 I declared \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal\u201d in Round 2.\nThus, only Players 2, 4, and 6 remain as possible criminals. However, we need to have exactly one criminal.\n\n5. Considering the Investigator behavior:\n\u2003\u2022 Investigators always tell the truth. My own truthful statement confirms Player 5 is innocent.\n\u2003\u2022 Player 4\u2019s statements (\u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal\u201d in Round 1 and \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal\u201d in Round 2) are consistently true regardless of whether the criminal is Player 2 or Player 6. This consistency strongly suggests that Player 4 may be one of the Investigators.\n\u2003\u2022 Look at Player 5: his Round 1 \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal\u201d and Round 2 \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal\u201d \u2013 if he were an Investigator, both statements need to be true. Note that if Player 2 were the criminal, his claim \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal\u201d would be false. That inconsistency leads us to favor the alternative.\n\n6. Now compare two plausible scenarios:\n\n\u2003Scenario A \u2013 Suppose Player 2 is the Criminal:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Then, as an Investigator, my statement is true and Player 3 and Player 5 being innocent is maintained.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 For consistency, the three Investigators would likely be Players 1, 4, and 6. In this case, Player 6\u2019s Round 2 claim \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal\u201d is true. However, note that Player 5 (who in this scenario would be non\u2010Investigator) has a Round 2 statement \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal\u201d \u2013 which would be false. While non-Investigators can lie, having an apparently truthful statement from someone we already cleared (by my own declaration) raises a concern if we expect our self\u2010confessed Investigators to always tell the truth.\n\n\u2003Scenario B \u2013 Suppose Player 6 is the Criminal:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Then my statement (\u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal\u201d) still holds, and the round 1 statement clearing Player 3 is fine.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 The likely Investigators here become Players 1, 4, and 5. Check their statements:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2013 I (Player 1) declared \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal\u201d (Round 1) and \u201cPlayer 5 is not criminal\u201d (Round 2): both true.\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2013 Player 4 stated \u201cPlayer 1 is not criminal\u201d (Round 1) and \u201cPlayer 3 is not criminal\u201d (Round 2): both true.\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2013 Player 5 stated \u201cPlayer 4 is not criminal\u201d (Round 1) and \u201cPlayer 2 is not criminal\u201d (Round 2): if the criminal is Player 6 then both are true.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Meanwhile, Player 2 (non-Investigator) has given conflicting statements about Player 6, and Player 3 (non-Investigator) falsely accused me. Player 6\u2019s own statements as the criminal may be arbitrarily true or false. This setup is fully consistent with the rules.\n\n7. Given the consistency and the necessary truthfulness of Investigator statements, Scenario B (where Player 6 is the criminal) offers a natural distribution of roles:\n\u2003\u2013 Investigators: Players 1, 4, and 5 (all their statements check out as true).\n\u2003\u2013 Non-Investigators: Players 2 and 3 (with inconsistent and false statements, respectively) plus the Criminal: Player 6.\n\nThus, based on the available statements from Rounds 1 and 2, I conclude that the most consistent explanation is that Player 6 is the Criminal.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 6.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

That would leave Players 2, 3, and 6 as the non\u2010Investigator roles (one Criminal, one Rumormonger, and one Lunatic).\n\u2022 Both Players 2 and 6 accuse me (\u201cPlayer 1 is the criminal\u201d). Since I am an Investigator and truthful, these claims must be false. That is expected if they are either the Criminal or the confused Rumormonger/Lunatic.\n\u2022 Player 3 states \u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal.\u201d Although Player 3 is not necessarily an Investigator (given we already have three likely\u2014a group of Players 1, 4, and 5), his statement points toward Player 2.\n\u2022 Weighing the evidence, the most logically consistent assignment is that Player 2 is the Criminal, while Players 3 and 6 are the remaining roles (Rumormonger and Lunatic in some order).\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 2.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

The three remaining roles (Criminal, Rumormonger, and Lunatic) may say things that are true or false without any consistency, even though they privately believe they are either Criminal or (falsely) Investigator.\n\nThe Round 1 statements are:\n\u2003\u2013 Player 1: \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d (True.)\n\u2003\u2013 Player 2: \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2013 Player 3: \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2013 Player 4: \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2013 Player 5: \u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2013 Player 6: \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal.\u201d\n\nHow might these be interpreted? There are two plausible scenarios from the statements:\n\nScenario A:\n\u2003\u2022 Suppose that Player 2 is an Investigator. Then his statement (\u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal\u201d) must be true. Also, if Player 6 is also an Investigator then his identical assertion reinforces this view. In that case:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Investigators would be Players 1, 2, and 6 (all giving correct information).\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 The Criminal would be Player 4.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 The remaining two (Players 3 and 5) are the non\u2010Investigator roles. (Player 5\u2019s statement \u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal\u201d would be false \u2013 that\u2019s acceptable for a Rumormonger or Lunatic; and Player 3\u2019s incorrect claim that \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal\u201d would similarly come from a non\u2010Investigator.)\n\u2003\u2022 This scenario is internally consistent with all verified true statements (remembering that as an Investigator, I can trust my own statement).\n\nScenario B:\n\u2003\u2022 Alternatively, suppose that Player 3 is one of the Investigators. Then his statement \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal\u201d is true. That would force us to reject Player 2\u2019s (and Player 6\u2019s) claim that Player 4 is criminal as coming from non\u2010Investigator roles. In that case, another Investigator (apart from myself and Player 3) might be Player 5 \u2013 since his statement \u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal\u201d would then be true if indeed Player 2 is the Criminal. Then:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Investigators would be Players 1, 3, and 5.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 The Criminal would be Player 2.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 The statements from Players 2, 4, and 6 (some true by chance, some false) are not required to follow the \u201calways truthful\u201d rule.\n\u2003\u2022 While this possibility also does not violate any rule, note that in this scenario only one player (Player 5) supports a candidate other than Player 4 for being criminal, while in Scenario A two players (Players 2 and 6) point to Player 4.\n\nComparing the two, Scenario A garners more support from players (two separate statements claiming \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal\u201d rather than one indicating \u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal\u201d). Because I know my own role for certain and I trust that Investigators always speak truthfully, the evidence from the round is slightly more consistent with the Criminal being Player 4.\n\nTaking into account the possibilities and having to commit to the most likely conclusion from the Round 1 information, my judgment is:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 4.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

If Player 3 is an Investigator, this is a true statement (and if not, it just happens to be correct).\n\n\u2022 Player 4 says \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2013 This is another statement that would be reliably true if Player 4 were an Investigator. However, note that it conflicts with another statement coming up.\n\n\u2022 Player 5 says \u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2013 This directly contradicts Player 4\u2019s statement about Player 2. Since only Investigators are guaranteed truthfulness, both of them cannot be Investigators. (Remember, there are only three Investigators in the game.)\n\n\u2022 Player 6 says \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2013 Again, consistent with what is known about me.\n\nNow, comparing the statements in Round 2:\n\u2003\u2013 My statement and Player 6\u2019s statement confirm that neither I nor Player 6 is the criminal.\n\u2003\u2013 Two players (Player 2 and Player 6 when taken with my knowledge) are pointing toward Player 4 as the criminal (Player 2 outright, and previously in Round 1 multiple statements supported Player 4).\n\u2003\u2013 There is a direct conflict regarding whether Player 2 is the criminal (Player 4 says no; Player 5 says yes). Given that we\u2019re more inclined to rely on Investigator statements, and Player 2\u2019s claim that \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal\u201d fits with both Round 1 and now Round 2, it lends more credibility to a scenario where Player 4 is indeed the criminal.\n\u2003\u2013 Thus, the most consistent scenario is one where the true Investigators (including me) are Players 1, 2, and 6; and their statements lead us to conclude that Player 4 is the criminal. The remaining players (Players 3, 4, and 5) must be the non\u2010Investigator roles\u2014with Player 4 specifically being the criminal.\n\nBased on these considerations, my conclusion after Round 2 is:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 4.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

But since they accuse each other, they cannot both be genuine Investigators. One possibility is that one of these players (P3 or P5) is indeed an Investigator (and so tells the truth) while the other is not\u2014perhaps the Criminal (who can lie) or one of the other roles allowed to be mistaken.\n\nNow let\u2019s examine the other statements:\n\n\u2022 Player 2 says \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2022 Player 4 (who we know is not criminal) says \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2022 Player 6 says \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\nIf we consider the possibility that P3 (an Investigator) is telling the truth, then Player 5 must be the criminal. In that case:\n\u2003\u2013 P1 (\u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal\u201d) is true.\n\u2003\u2013 P2 (\u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal\u201d) is true.\n\u2003\u2013 P3 (\u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal\u201d) is true.\n\u2003\u2013 As the criminal, Player 5 may lie, so his claim that \u201cPlayer 3 is the criminal\u201d would be a misdirection.\n\u2003\u2013 Player 4 (being either a Rumormonger or Lunatic) might make a false or misleading statement when saying \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2013 Player 6\u2019s \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal\u201d is also compatible with this picture.\n\nThis possibility is completely consistent with the rules and the fact that three Investigators (remember, I am one) must always speak truthfully. (The alternate possibility\u2014P5 being an Investigator and accusing P3\u2014leads to a symmetric situation. At this point the Round 1 data does not allow us to rule one out unambiguously.)\n\nBecause I must commit to a judgment each round and the statements slightly favor the scenario where P3\u2019s truthful statement (as an Investigator) makes Player 5 the criminal, I lean that way.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 5.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

This suggests that among the players not known to be criminals (I know I\u2019m not, and my assessment of others from Round 3 supports it), the strongest consistent and repeated accusation in Round 3 is against Player 5\u2014from both Player 4 and Player 6 (and in Round 1, Player 3 also accused Player 5).\n\nFurthermore, note that if we try other possibilities \u2013 for example, if Player 2 were the criminal \u2013 we run into problems.

Also, my own statement and those from Players 2 and 6 support that the criminal must be among those accused by multiple other players.\n\nThus, the emerging picture is this:\n\u2003\u2022 I, Player 1, along with Players 2 and 6, appear to be consistently stating correct facts, consistent with being Investigators.\n\u2003\u2022 Player 4, although mistaken in Round 1, gives correct information in Round 3.

(Reminder: As Player 1 I am Investigator. Investigators always state the truth about who is criminal, so each statement I give must be true given what I know at that moment.)\n\n2. In Round 1 I stated \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal.\u201d Later, in Round 2 I said \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d Because I must always tell the truth, the later round (given additional evidence) leads me to update my belief. (In games like these it is possible that early uncertainty is revised when more statements appear. I now trust the Round 2 update over my earlier statement, knowing that each round I\u2019m allowed to adjust my final judgment as new evidence comes in.)\n\n3. In Round 2 the statements include:\n\u2003\u2022 My statement \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal\u201d (truth).\n\u2003\u2022 Player 2 said \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal.\u201d Because this directly contradicts my truthful statement, Player 2\u2019s claim is false.

Then in Round 3:\n\u2003\u2022 I state \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal\u201d (again, a truthful assertion).\n\u2003\u2022 Players 2 and 5 also say \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal.\u201d (This largely reinforces that Player 3 is innocent.)\n\u2003\u2022 Both Players 3 and 4 say \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 Player 6 states \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\n5.

That leaves only Players 2 and 5 as possibilities. Now note that in Round 2 Player 2 made a claim (\u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal\u201d) that conflicts directly with my truthful claim that \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d In this game, an Investigator never lies. This means that Player 2 must be one of the roles that can lie freely. (The Criminal, Rumormonger, and Lunatic each have the option to be misleading.)

Role Allocation Likelihood:\n\u2003\u2013 We expect three Investigators. Given my known role and the consistency of P3 and P4\u2019s statements, it\u2019s natural to classify P1, P3, and P4 as the Investigators.\n\u2003\u2013 This leaves P2, P5, and P6 for the Criminal, the Rumormonger, and the Lunatic.\n\u2003\u2013 P2 has made two identical accusations against me (which are false) and an additional statement in Round 1 that isn\u2019t enough to clear him; his repeated false claim points away from an honest Investigator.\n\u2003\u2013 P5\u2019s statements are contradictory (claiming in Round 1 that P2 is not the criminal, then in Round 2 that P2 is, and in Round 3 accusing P6, who I know is safe). In contrast, the consistent claim from Investigator P4 in Round 2 (\u201cP5 is the criminal\u201d) strongly implicates P5.\n\u2003\u2013 P6\u2019s statements are inconsistent (Round 1 accuses P5, but Round 3 exonerates P5), which is acceptable for a role that does not have to stick to the truth.\n\n3. Focusing on the Crucial Accusation:\n\u2003\u2013 The consistent and trusted statement by P4 in Round 2 \u2014 \u201cP5 is the criminal\u201d \u2014 along with P6\u2019s initial accusation in Round 1, points strongly to P5.\n\u2003\u2013 Even though P5 (if he is the criminal) may lie arbitrarily, his pattern of contradictory claims reinforces the suspicion, especially when contrasted with the reliable Investigator statements.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nConclusion:\nGiven that my role as an Investigator is confirmed, and considering the consistency of the safe list from P1, P3, and P4, the only viable candidate for the criminal is Player 5.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 5.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

(Other players\u2019 roles may sometimes produce contradictory or shifting statements.) \n\nI note that across rounds my own statements about Player 5 conflict (in Round 2 I declared \u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal\u201d but in Round 3 I state \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal\u201d). In light of further evidence I have updated my own conclusion in Round 3. (In a sequential game it is possible for a player to modify earlier public claims, and here my final judgment is based on the totality of evidence.) \n\nHere is how I now reason about the likely situation:\n\n1. There are three truth\u2010tellers (the Investigators). I know I count as one. When I look at the other players, I see that some have been consistent over rounds. In particular, observe:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Player 3 said in Round 1 \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal\u201d and in Rounds 2 and 3 they say \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d If Player 3 is an Investigator, then the Round\u202f1 claim would be entirely true, pinpointing Player 6.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Player 4 consistently clears Player 1 (Round\u202f1) and Player 3 (Round\u202f2) and in Round 3 accuses Player 6.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Player 5, across rounds, always exonerates Player 1 (and in Round\u202f2 and 3 clears Player 3). Their statements never name a suspect; rather, they simply clear others.\n\u2003\u2003These three \u2013 Players 3, 4, and 5 \u2013 have no internal contradictions if we assume that the criminal is Player 6 (since then \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal\u201d from P3 and P4 would be true, and their \u201cnot\u201d statements about others remain true). \n\n2. On the other hand, Player 2 has maintained that Player 5 is criminal (Rounds 2 and 3). If Player 2 were an Investigator then Player 5 would have to be the criminal; but that would conflict with the consistent claims by Players 3, 4, and 5. The weight of the consistent testimony plus the fact that as Investigator I have updated my view (in Round 3, \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal\u201d) leads me to discount P2\u2019s conclusion.\n\u2003\n3. Turning to my own record: Although in Round\u202f2 I declared \u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal,\u201d based on the fresh testimony of Round\u202f3 (including from suspected fellow Investigators) I have come to revise my stance. Now I confidently say \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d In effect, my most recent (and final) judgment aligns with the consistent truth-telling of Players 3, 4, and 5\u2014all pointing to Player 6 as the culprit.\n\n4. Finally, no matter which of the non-investigator roles (Rumormonger or Lunatic) might be influencing other players\u2019 statements, the three consistent sets of truthful statements (which my investigation now ascribes to P3, P4, and P5) together require that the criminal is Player 6.\n\nThus, despite my earlier round\u2019s claim, after reviewing all statements I update my final conclusion so that every statement from those I now suspect to be true fits together.\n\nMy Final Judgment is therefore:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 6.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

(I must \u201ctrust\u201d that assignment even though I might then be motivated to mislead others.)\n\n2. In this game only true Investigators always speak truthfully when they make a claim about who the criminal is. Thus, if an Investigator names a criminal it must be the actual criminal. Equally, if an Investigator says \u201cso-and-so is not the criminal\u201d it must be true.\n\n3. Now let\u2019s check the Round 1 statements under the assumption that the true Criminal is me (Player 1):\n\n\u2003\u2022 Player 1 (me) says \u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 As Criminal, my claim may be arbitrary (true or false by design); here it is false if I really am the criminal.\n\n\u2003\u2022 Player 2 says \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Under the assumption that I am criminal, this claim is false. Therefore if Player 2 were a genuine Investigator he could not lie. So Player 2 must be either Rumormonger or Lunatic.\n\n\u2003\u2022 Player 3 says \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 This statement is also false under our assumption. So Player 3 cannot be an Investigator; they must be one of the roles that can give arbitrary (possibly false) information.\n\n\u2003\u2022 Player 4 says \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Since the actual criminal is me (Player 1), the statement \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal\u201d is true. This is consistent with what an Investigator would say, so Player 4 could be one of the Investigators.\n\n\u2003\u2022 Player 5 says \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 But since I am the criminal, this statement is false. That rules out Player 5 being a true Investigator; Player 5 must be Rumormonger or Lunatic.\n\n\u2003\u2022 Player 6 says \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Given that I (Player 1) am criminal, it is indeed true that Player 2 is not the criminal. So Player 6\u2019s statement is correct and consistent with the behavior of an Investigator.\n\n4. Because there are exactly three Investigators, and Investigators must be 100% truthful regarding the criminal\u2019s identity, we expect that any Investigator\u2019s claim would name Player 1 if they made a claim \u201cX is the criminal\u201d or (if denying someone is criminal) not contradict the fact that I am the criminal.\n\n\u2003\u2013 In Round 1, only Player 4 (\u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal\u201d) and Player 6 (\u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal\u201d) speak in a way that is consistent with being Investigators. (If they were true Investigators, they would have named me if asked \u201cWho is the criminal?\u201d, but here they instead deny someone as criminal\u2014and their denials are indeed true if I am criminal.)\n\n\u2003\u2013 The other players (Players 2, 3, and 5) have given claims that are false if I really am criminal. That would preclude them from being genuine Investigators (they might be Rumormongers who mistakenly think they are Investigators or Lunatics who believe they are Criminals\u2014the rules allow such players to provide statements that may be false).\n\n5. Although we are still missing the identification of one true Investigator (since there must be three in total, and so far only Players 4 and 6 have spoken in a way that fits the required truthfulness), the analysis so far is exactly what I would expect if I really were Criminal.\n\nFinal Judgment after Round 1:\n\u2003Final Criminal Is Player 1.\n\u2003My Role Is Criminal.\n\nThis is my most likely conclusion based on the Round 1 statements and the given role assignments."

Let\u2019s check each statement assuming the true criminal is Player 1:\n\n\u2003\u2022 Player 1 (me) says \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 If Player 1 is Criminal, then Player 6 is not criminal. This statement is false\u2014which is permitted for the Criminal.\n\n\u2003\u2022 Player 2 says \u201cPlayer 1 is the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 This is a true statement if I really am the criminal. (Note that even though truth is what Investigators always deliver, non-Investigators may sometimes get it right by chance; from previous rounds, we suspected that Players 2 and 5 are non-Investigators.)\n\n\u2003\u2022 Player 3 says \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 This is true under our assumption. (Player 3\u2019s consistent truthfulness in past rounds pointed to an Investigator role.)\n\n\u2003\u2022 Player 4 says \u201cPlayer 1 is the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 This is true, which is what an Investigator would say.

Integrating this with the analysis from previous rounds, a configuration consistent with all rounds is:  \n\u2003\u2013 Criminal: Player 1 (that\u2019s me).  \n\u2003\u2013 Investigators (truth-tellers in statements about who is or isn\u2019t criminal) are likely Players 3, 4, and 6.  \n\u2003\u2013 Players 2 and 5 (whose statements in prior rounds were false or misleading) are the ones who are not actual Investigators (they must be either the Rumormonger or the Lunatic).\n\n4. In Round 3, although four players made statements that are factually correct, only three of them can be genuine Investigators. This extra correct statement from a non-Investigator (say, Player 2) isn\u2019t a contradiction\u2014it is simply that non-Investigator roles can sometimes make a true statement even if they are allowed to lie. What matters is that the consistent pattern from all rounds uniquely identifies Player 1 as the criminal.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

Player 5\u2019s Round 1 claim (\u201cPlayer 1 is the criminal\u201d) is clearly false given my known role. His second round statement\u2014\u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal\u201d\u2014is less helpful when weighed against the bulk of votes pointing to him.\n6.

Other players\u2019 statements may or may not be reliable unless we\u2019re sure they\u2019re also Investigators; there are exactly three Investigators, one Criminal, one Rumormonger, and one Lunatic.)\n\n1. I (Player\u202f1) said, \u201cPlayer\u00a06 is not the criminal.\u201d Because I\u2019m an Investigator, this statement is definitely true. So we know Player\u00a06 is not the Criminal.\n\n2. Player\u202f2 said, \u201cPlayer\u00a01 is not the criminal.\u201d If Player\u00a02 were an Investigator the statement would be true\u2014which it is (I\u2019m not the Criminal). (If not, they could be mistaken.) In any event, there is no conflict here.\n\n3. Player\u202f3 said, \u201cPlayer\u00a06 is the criminal.\u201d But since I know for sure (as an Investigator) that Player\u00a06 is not the Criminal, Player\u00a03\u2019s statement is false. (An Investigator would not lie. Therefore, Player\u00a03 cannot be one of the Investigators and must be either the Criminal, the Rumormonger, or the Lunatic.)\n\n4. Player\u202f4 said, \u201cPlayer\u00a03 is the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2022 If Player\u00a04 were an Investigator, then their statement would have to be true. In that scenario, Player\u00a03 would indeed be the Criminal\u2014and that would explain the false claim from Player\u00a03.  \n\u2003\u2022 If Player\u00a04 is not an Investigator, then their statement might be false. (So the possibility exists that someone else is the Criminal.)\n\n5. Player\u202f5 said, \u201cPlayer\u00a03 is not the criminal.\u201d This directly contradicts Player\u00a04\u2019s statement. Since only Investigators are bound to be truthful, the conflict implies that at most one of them is a genuine Investigator. (Recall we must have three Investigators total. I already know I am one, so two of the others are honest truth-tellers.)\n\n6. Player\u202f6 said, \u201cPlayer\u00a04 is not the criminal.\u201d This statement (coming from Player\u00a06) is not forced to be accurate\u2014unless Player\u00a06 were an Investigator\u2014but it does not conflict with our known fact if Player\u00a04 were not the Criminal.\n\nNow let\u2019s compare two plausible interpretations:\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500  \nInterpretation A:\n\u2022 Assume Player\u00a04 is an Investigator. Then their statement that \u201cPlayer\u00a03 is the criminal\u201d must be true.\n\u2003\u2003\u25ba Player\u00a03 is the Criminal.\n\u2022 This makes Player\u00a05\u2019s statement (\u201cPlayer\u00a03 is not the criminal\u201d) false. (Thus Player\u00a05 would not be an Investigator.)\n\u2022 Player\u00a03\u2019s false claim (\u201cPlayer\u00a06 is the criminal\u201d) is acceptable if Player\u00a03 is the Criminal.\n\u2022 Player\u00a01 (me) and likely Player\u00a02 would be the other Investigators.  \n\u2003\u2013 The remaining two players (besides the Criminal and the three Investigators) would be the Rumormonger and the Lunatic.\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500  \nInterpretation B:\n\u2022 Assume instead that Player\u00a05 is an Investigator. Then their statement (\u201cPlayer\u00a03 is not the criminal\u201d) must be true.\n\u2003\u2003\u25ba Player\u00a03 is not the Criminal.\n\u2022 In that case, Player\u00a04\u2019s statement (\u201cPlayer\u00a03 is the criminal\u201d) is false; hence, Player\u00a04 is not an Investigator.\n\u2022 We must then pick a different candidate for Criminal (for instance, Player\u00a04 might be the Criminal). However, note that Player\u00a06\u2019s statement (\u201cPlayer\u00a04 is not the criminal\u201d) would then be false.\n\u2022 Also, we already see a clear contradiction from Player\u00a03\u2019s statement (since I know for sure that Player\u00a06 isn\u2019t the Criminal).\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500  \n\nSensitivity to the Investigator\u2019s duty is highest for those players who are known to be truthful. Since my own and the likelihood of another Investigator\u2019s statement is strong, Interpretation A (with Player\u00a04\u2019s statement being taken as truthful) neatly explains the contradiction:  \n\u2003\u2013 Player\u00a01 (me) and Player\u00a02 and Player\u00a04 would be the three Investigators, and they always speak truthfully.\n\u2003\u2013 Then, Player\u00a03 (who made a false claim) must be the Criminal.\n\u2003\u2013 The remaining roles (Rumormonger and Lunatic) fall to Players\u00a05 and\u00a06, whose statements can be either true or false without constraint.\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500  \n\nBased on the above reasoning, Interpretation A is the most straightforward explanation of the data from Round 1.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 3.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

Therefore, my statement \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal\u201d confirms that Player 2 is safe. \n\n2. Players 2, 3, 5, and 6 all give statements of \u201cnot criminal\u201d (Player 2 saying Player 6 is not the criminal, Player 3 saying Player 6 is not the criminal, and Players 5 and 6 each saying Player 2 is not the criminal). If any of these players were Investigators they would be truthful. (They might instead be the Rumormonger or Lunatic\u2014if so, they can sometimes accidentally be right.) In any case, a strong consensus emerges that Player 2 and Player 6 are not the criminal.\n\n3. The only accusatory statement is from Player 4, who says \u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Since only Investigators are bound to always tell the truth, if Player 4 were an Investigator then his claim would be 100% true. But then we would have four safe Investigators (Players 1, 2, 3, and 4), while the game calls for only three.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Thus Player 4 cannot be an Investigator. Being a non\u2010Investigator (either Criminal, Rumormonger, or Lunatic), his statement is not bound by honesty. In this case, his accusation still draws our attention to Player 5.\n\n4. Because at least four players\u2019 statements (including my own) clearly confirm that Players 2 and 6 are not the criminal, the criminal must be among the remaining players: namely, Player 4 or Player 5.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 If Player 4 were the criminal, we\u2019d expect him to deflect blame\u2014and indeed his \u201caccusation\u201d of Player 5 would be a deflection.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Alternatively, if Player 5 were the criminal then Player 4\u2019s accusation would be (accidentally) correct even if he isn\u2019t an Investigator.\n\n5. A likely consistent distribution is as follows:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Investigators: Player 1 (me), Player 2, and one of either Player 3 or Player 4. (They must be exactly three.)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Criminal: One candidate from {Player 4, Player 5}.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Non\u2010Investigators left: One must be the Rumormonger (who believes he\u2019s an Investigator but might be wrong) and one the Lunatic (who believes he\u2019s the Criminal but whose statements might be arbitrary).\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 With a preponderance of \u201cnot criminal\u201d validations regarding Players 2 and 6, and given that Player 4 is the only one offering a direct accusation, the evidence most consistently points toward Player 5 as the criminal.\n\nBased solely on the Round 1 statements and applying the game\u2019s logic, I am most inclined to conclude that the criminal is Player 5.

If Player 2 is an Investigator as well, his statement would be truthful. In any case, his claim supports the idea that Player 3 is indeed the criminal.\n\n3. Player 6 says that Player 3 is the criminal. Again, if Player 6 is an Investigator, his statement is truthful. This further reinforces the conclusion that Player 3 is the criminal.\n\n4. Player 3, who is the criminal (as deduced from my truthful statement), accuses Player 1 of being the criminal. As the criminal, Player 3 can lie or tell the truth. His deflection here is consistent with a criminal trying to shift blame.\n\n5. Player 4 claims that Player 1 is not the criminal. This statement is factually correct. However, since only Investigators always tell the truth, if Player 4 were an Investigator, his statement would be bound to be true. It is possible he is an Investigator, but we already have to account for exactly three Investigators. Given my statement and the supportive statements from Players 2 and 6, it is plausible that Players 1, 2, and 6 are the Investigators, which would leave Players 3, 4, and 5 for Criminal, Rumormonger, and Lunatic roles in some order. Since Player 3 is deduced as the criminal, Players 4 and 5 must be the Rumormonger and the Lunatic.\n\n6. Finally, Player 5 states that Player 2 is the criminal. Given that multiple pieces of evidence indicate that Player 2 is likely an Innocent Investigator, this statement is false. This false claim is consistent with Player 5 being either the Rumormonger (who believes they are an Investigator but sometimes errs) or the Lunatic (who believes they are a Criminal and can say anything).\n\nThe overall evidence in Round 2 strongly supports that Player 3 is the criminal (based on my own confirmed truthful statement and others\u2019 consistent claims).

(They might be the Criminal, the Rumormonger, or the Lunatic; their statements could be misleading or even accidentally correct, so we cannot count on them for consistency.)\n\u2003\u25e6 We check consistency:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 My statement \u201cPlayer 3 is not criminal\u201d is fine.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 P3\u2019s statement is fine.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 P4\u2019s statement indicates that Player 2 is the criminal.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 P2\u2019s claim is a lie (or misleading) while his role is not Investigator.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 P5\u2019s statement and P6\u2019s statement disagree about P4, but since neither is an Investigator in this scenario, that conflict is acceptable.\nThus, the set {P1, P3, P4} as Investigators with the criminal being Player 2 is entirely consistent.\n\nThere is another possibility (for example, if instead {P1, P3, P5} were the Investigators then the criminal would have to be P4) but both options seem to neatly \u201cexplain\u201d the differences. At the end of Round 1 the information isn\u2019t completely definitive. However, weighing the consistency of the truthful statements from what are most likely the Investigators, the scenario with P1, P3, and P4 providing the correct information appears slightly more natural.

My Round 2 statement clearly tells us P2 is not the criminal. In addition, P3 and P5 also state \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal\u201d in Round 2. The consistency among these three statements strongly suggests that P2 is indeed not the criminal.\n\n2. In Round 1, however, P4 claimed \u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal.\u201d Since we now have multiple independent assertions (including mine) that P2 is not criminal, P4\u2019s claim in round 1 appears to be false. (Recall: Only Investigators always tell the truth. Non-Investigators\u2014Criminal, Rumormonger, or Lunatic\u2014can provide misleading information.)\n\n3. Let\u2019s try to identify the likely Investigators. I know I am one. It would be natural to suspect that the players who provide consistently \u201cpositive\u201d confirmations (i.e. statements we\u2019d expect true from an Investigator) are the other Investigators. Notice that:\n\u2003\u2022 In Round 1, P3 said \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d \n\u2003\u2022 In Round 2, P5 said \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal.\u201d\nThese align with my statement in Round 2 (\u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal\u201d) and do not create any conflict if they are truth-tellers. Thus it is reasonable to hypothesize that P3 and P5 also are the Investigators.\n\n4. Under that hypothesis (Investigators being P1, P3, and P5), consider their statements:\n\u2003\u2022 P1 (me): R1: \u201cP3 is not criminal\u201d; R2: \u201cP2 is not criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 P3: R1: \u201cPlayer 5 is not criminal\u201d (thus P5 is not criminal, aligning with Investigator status); R2: \u201cPlayer 2 is not criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 P5: R1: \u201cPlayer 4 is criminal\u201d and R2: \u201cPlayer 2 is not criminal.\u201d\nSince Investigators are required to tell the truth, P5\u2019s Round 1 statement forces the conclusion that P4 must be the criminal.\n\n5. Examining the other players\u2019 statements as non-Investigators:\n\u2003\u2022 P2 (non-Investigator) claimed \u201cPlayer 5 is criminal\u201d in Round 1 and \u201cPlayer 6 is criminal\u201d in Round 2. Both are false if the criminal is P4.\n\u2003\u2022 P4 (if criminal) made claims (\u201cPlayer 2 is criminal\u201d in Round 1 and \u201cPlayer 5 is criminal\u201d in Round 2) that we now know are false.\n\u2003\u2022 P6 (non-Investigator) has conflicting statements: In Round 1 \u201cPlayer 4 is not criminal\u201d and in Round 2 \u201cPlayer 4 is criminal.\u201d Since only Investigators must be consistent, P6\u2019s mixed messages are acceptable for a non-Investigator.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nConclusion:\nThe most consistent scenario is that the true Investigators are P1 (me), P3, and P5. As a result, since P5 truthfully asserted in Round 1 that \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal,\u201d we conclude that the criminal is Player 4.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 4.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

Certain Facts from My (P1) Statements:\n\u2003\u2013 P1\u2019s statements in Rounds 1 and 3 tell us that Player 3 is not the criminal.\n\u2003\u2013 P1\u2019s statement in Round 2 tells us that Player 2 is not the criminal.\nThus, P2 and P3 are ruled out as the criminal.\n\n2. Candidate for Criminal:\n\u2003Looking at the accusations:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 In Round 1, P5 accuses P4.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 In Round 2, P6 says P4 is criminal.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 In Round 3, P5 again accuses P4.\n\u2003These consistent statements strongly suggest that P4 is the criminal. In contrast, other players (P2 and P4 themselves, for instance) make conflicting or contradictory claims.\n\n3. Identifying Likely Investigators:\n\u2003We know that only Investigators always tell the truth. My statements are true. Looking for consistency:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 In Round 1, P3 says \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 In Round 2, both P3 and P5 state \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal\u201d (which aligns with my direct statement).\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 In Round 3, P3 says \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal\u201d and P1\u2019s own statements are consistent.\n\u2003This pattern makes it natural to suspect that Players 1, 3, and 5 are our Investigators. Their statements are all consistent with the conclusion that the criminal is P4.\n\n4. Checking Against All Rounds:\n\u2003Assume Investigators are P1, P3, and P5 and the criminal is P4.\n\u2003\u2013 In Round 1:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 P1 (\u201cP3 is not criminal\u201d) is true.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 P3 (\u201cPlayer 5 is not criminal\u201d) is true.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 P5 (\u201cPlayer 4 is criminal\u201d) is true.\n\u2003\u2013 In Round 2:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 P1, P3, and P5 all confirm \u201cPlayer 2 is not criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 P6\u2019s statement that \u201cPlayer 4 is criminal\u201d aligns with our candidate (even if coming from a non-investigator, it happens to be true).\n\u2003\u2013 In Round 3:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 P1 and P3 remain consistent.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 P5 again states \u201cPlayer 4 is criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 The conflicting claims by P2 (\u201cPlayer 1 is criminal\u201d) and P4 (\u201cPlayer 3 is criminal\u201d) are made by players outside our set of truth\u2010tellers.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 P6\u2019s Round 3 statement (\u201cPlayer 4 is not criminal\u201d) conflicts with Investigator P5 but is acceptable as non-investigator inconsistency.\n\u2003Every round fits our pattern if we assign player roles as follows:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Investigators: P1, P3, P5 (truthful)\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 The criminal: P4 (who lies or misleads uniformly)\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Others (P2 and P6): non-investigators (Rumormonger and Lunatic), allowed to provide inconsistent information.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nFinal Judgment\n\nAll rounds, when combined, point to Player 4 as the criminal with the most natural and consistent explanation, and I remain an Investigator.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 4.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

Therefore, my statement \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal\u201d tells us for sure that Player 2 is innocent of being the criminal.\n\n2. Player 2 says \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal.\u201d If Player 2 happens to be an Investigator then he would be telling the truth. (If not, his statement could be an arbitrary claim.) So one possibility is that Player 4 is indeed the criminal.\n\n3. Player 3 says \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal.\u201d If Player 3 is one of the truth\u2010tellers (an Investigator) then his statement is correct\u2014meaning that Player 6 is not the criminal.\n\n4. Player 4 says \u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal.\u201d (If Player 4 were the criminal, he might use his freedom to mislead. Alternatively, if Player 4 were an Investigator then his statement would be true\u2014but that second possibility is in conflict with Player 2\u2019s claim if Player 2 is an Investigator.)\n\n5. Player 5 says \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal.\u201d This echoes what I already know from my own statement.\n\n6. Player 6 says \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d This directly contradicts Player 2\u2019s claim if Player 2 is telling the truth.\n\nNow, recall that there are exactly three Investigators (who always tell the truth). I already know I\u2019m one. One scenario that fits the facts is as follows:\n\n\u2022 Suppose Player 2 is indeed an Investigator. Then his statement \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal\u201d is truthful.  \n\u2022 Suppose Player 3 (with the statement about Player 6) is our third Investigator.  \n\u2022 That would mean the three Investigators are Players 1, 2, and 3.  \n\u2022 In that case the criminal must be Player 4 (to satisfy Player 2\u2019s true claim), while Player 4\u2019s claim (\u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal\u201d) is a deliberate misdirection coming from the criminal.  \n\u2022 The remaining players (Player 5 and Player 6) would then be the Rumormonger and the Lunatic (whose statements may be arbitrary)\u2014and note that Player 6\u2019s statement \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal\u201d would then be simply wrong.\n\nThis scenario is fully consistent with what we heard. (There is another possible assignment, for example one in which Player 4 is an Investigator and Player 5 is the criminal; however, based solely on the round\u20101 statements the balance of evidence leans toward the scenario where the trustworthy voices (Players 1, 2, and 3) indicate that Player 4 is the criminal.)\n\nBased on the above reasoning, my most likely conclusion after Round 1 is:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 4.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

This inconsistency supports the idea that Player 2 is not an Investigator (likely the Rumormonger or the Lunatic). Likewise, Player 4\u2019s own statements (pointing to Player 5 in Round 1 and then retracting that in Round 2) are not reliable and fit the profile of a criminal trying to confuse us.\n\nSo, based on these rounds:\n\u2022 The evidence from Investigator-consistent players (Players 1, 3, and 5) indicates that Player 4 is the criminal.\n\u2022 My role is confirmed as Investigator.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 4.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

This directly points to Player 4 as the criminal.\n\n\u2022 Player 4 says \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2013 As an Investigator this would be true, but if Player 4 is the criminal (or if he is a Lunatic), the statement can be arbitrary.

In every round, my statement must reveal the truth about whoever is actually the criminal. (Investigators never lie.)  \nNote that in Round 1 I said \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal\u201d and in Round 2 I said \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d Both would be true if those players are indeed innocent. In Round 3 I say \u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal\u201d and\u2014if I were remaining completely truthful\u2014the entire evidence would force us to conclude that Player 5 is the criminal. However, an Investigator\u2019s conclusions over the course of the game should be consistent. (All the statements (aside from those made by non\u2010Investigators) are intended to be reliable.)  \n\n(2) Examining the Majority of \u201cInvestigator\u2010style\u201d Claims  \nBecause there are three Investigators (and only they always state the truth), the \u201ctrue\u201d testimony should be found in a majority of players assumed to be Investigators. In earlier rounds the strongest common thread pointed to Player 4 as criminal:  \n\u2003\u2022 In Round 1, Player 2 said \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2022 In Round 2, both Player 2 and Player 3 (whom we could take as likely investigators) say that either Player 4 is criminal or clear other players.  \nMany other players (and my own Round 1 statement) clear Players 2, 3, 5, and 6.  \n\n(3) The Issue of Changing Statements  \nI note that in Round 2 I stated \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal\u201d whereas in Round 3 I state \u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal.\u201d As an Investigator, my statements must be truthful. Faced with contradictory personal statements across rounds, the most plausible interpretation is that as more evidence came to light my final conclusion changed. (In a multi\u2010round social deduction game, it is possible for a player to update their public statement in a later round when they become certain of a fact, even if earlier they were not sure.)  \n\nReconciling this change with the other available testimony poses a challenge. In Round 3, aside from my new claim, several other statements come into play:  \n\u2003\u2022 Player 2 (whom we have reasons to trust from earlier rounds) again asserts \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2022 Player 3 says \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal,\u201d which\u2014as an Investigator\u2010style claim\u2014remains consistent with my innocence.  \n\u2003\u2022 Meanwhile Player 5 and Player 4\u2019s statements may be from roles that are allowed to be misleading (Rumormonger or Lunatic).  \n\n(4) Weighing the Overall Evidence  \nLooking across all rounds the bulk of evidence (particularly the consistent claims in Rounds 1 and 2 and the consistent accusation by P2 in both Rounds 1 and 3 and by P3 in Round 2) suggests that Player 4 is the only candidate who is never \u201ccleared\u201d by nearly all of the players whose statements we can trust. If we accept that two of the three Investigators are, for example, Players 1, 2, and 3, then both my earlier testimony and that of P2 and P3 indicate that Player 4 is the criminal.  \n\nIt appears that my statement in Round 3 (\u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal\u201d) stands apart from a broad pattern of evidence. After reviewing every round, I must give greater weight to the consistency of the majority testimony (and to my own earlier clear statement in Round 2 that Player 5 was not criminal) than to a single updated declaration in Round 3 that contradicts the established pattern. (Equally, note that my Round 3 statement might have been an over\u2010correction in light of the many deceptive statements from non\u2010Investigator players.)  \n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\nFinal Judgment\n\nBased on the overall evidence from all rounds\u2014and giving priority to the consistent truth known from the reliable Investigators\u2014I conclude that the criminal is still Player 4.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 4.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

We don\u2019t yet know Player 2\u2019s role, so we can\u2019t be certain about the truth of this claim.\n\n3. Player 3 asserts that Player 4 is the criminal. If Player 3 were an Investigator (and thus always truthful), this claim would mean Player 4 is indeed the criminal.\n\n4. Player 4 says Player 3 is the criminal. Since we already have Player 3 accusing Player 4, the two contradict each other. However, only Investigators are guaranteed truthful\u2014so if either Player 3 or Player 4 is an Investigator the truth must be consistent with their claim. The conflict suggests that at most one of them is a reliable Investigator.\n\n5. Player 5, who according to my knowledge is not the criminal, also claims that Player 4 is the criminal. If Player 5 were an Investigator, then his statement supports Player 3\u2019s claim.\n\n6. Player 6 says Player 5 is not the criminal.

That leaves Player 4 as the likely Criminal. The remaining players, Player 2 and Player 6, would then be the Rumormonger and the Lunatic (whose statements are not bound by truthfulness).\n\nFinal Judgment after Round 1:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 4.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

Summarize each round\u2019s statements:\n\nRound 1:\n\u2022 P1: \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal.\u201d (Truth)  \n\u2022 P2: \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2022 P3: \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2022 P4: \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2022 P5: \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2022 P6: \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\nRound 2:\n\u2022 P1: \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal.\u201d (Truth)  \n\u2022 P2: \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2022 P3: \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2022 P4: \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2022 P5: \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2022 P6: \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nStep 3. What can we deduce from everyone\u2019s statements?\n\nFrom my statements and those of others:\n\u2013 Player 3: Both rounds say \u201cPlayer 3 is not criminal\u201d (either directly from me in R1 or from P6 in R2) so P3 is out.\n\u2013 Player 6: My Round 2 and P3\u2019s Round 2 say \u201cPlayer 6 is not criminal,\u201d so P6 is out.\n\u2013 Several players declare \u201cX is not criminal\u201d regarding P5:\n\u2003\u25e6 In Round 1, P3 and P6 both say \u201cPlayer 5 is not criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u25e6 In Round 2, P4 says \u201cPlayer 5 is not criminal.\u201d\n\u2003Thus, P5 is very likely not the criminal.\n  \nThat leaves Players 2 and 4 as possible criminals.\n\nNow let\u2019s examine the conflicting claims:\n\u2022 In Round 1, P2 says \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2022 In Round 2, P2 says \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal.\u201d Since we know P6 is not criminal, P2\u2019s Round 2 claim is false.\n\nAt the same time, note P5 in both rounds insists \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal,\u201d which is false. (As an Investigator\u2019s claim, \u201cis criminal\u201d must be correct; thus, since multiple other statements rule out P6, those two claims appear to be mistaken.)\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nStep 4. We now consider role consistency with our game constraints:\nWe must have exactly 3 Investigators (who always speak truth), 1 Criminal (who may lie or tell the truth arbitrarily), 1 Rumormonger (who mistakenly believes they are an Investigator but can be wrong), and 1 Lunatic (who believes they are Criminal and again can speak arbitrary truths or lies).\n\nHere is one very natural assignment consistent with the overall pattern:\n\u2003\u2022 Assume that the naturally \u201ctruthful\u201d players (based on their consistent \u201cnot criminal\u201d declarations in both rounds) are the Investigators.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 I (P1) am Investigator.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Player 3 has said \u201cP5 is not criminal\u201d (R1) and \u201cP6 is not criminal\u201d (R2) and is also confirmed by P6 in R2 (\u201cPlayer 3 is not criminal\u201d). So P3 fits as an Investigator.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Player 4 said \u201cP1 is not criminal\u201d (R1) and \u201cP5 is not criminal\u201d (R2). These are consistent facts. So let\u2019s place P4 among the Investigators.\n\u2003\u2022 Having 3 Investigators (P1, P3, P4) leaves the remaining roles for P2, P5, and P6.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 We already ruled out criminal status for P5 and P6 based on multiple \u201cnot criminal\u201d confirmations.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Thus, the only remaining candidate for criminal must be P2.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 That means P2 is the Criminal. (This fits with P2\u2019s inconsistent statements: his Round 1 claim \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal\u201d is a lie if he himself is the criminal; his Round 2 claim \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal\u201d is also false.)\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Then, P5 and P6 take the roles of Rumormonger and Lunatic. Their statements, though mistaken or arbitrary, are not bound to truth.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nStep 5. Final Check Against All Statements:\n\u2013 P1 (me, Investigator): Truthful; \u201cP3 is not criminal\u201d and \u201cP6 is not criminal\u201d hold.\n\u2013 P3 (Investigator): Says \u201cP5 is not criminal\u201d and \u201cP6 is not criminal,\u201d which are correct if the criminal is P2.\n\u2013 P4 (Investigator): Says \u201cPlayer 1 is not criminal\u201d and \u201cPlayer 5 is not criminal,\u201d which fit.\n\u2013 P2 (Criminal): Made two claims that turned out false (\u201cPlayer 4 is criminal\u201d and \u201cPlayer 6 is criminal\u201d), which is acceptable for a criminal.\n\u2013 P5 (Rumormonger) and P6 (Lunatic): Their mistaken or arbitrary claims (both saying \u201cPlayer 6 is criminal\u201d at times) are acceptable for their roles.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nFinal Judgment after Round 2:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 2.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

Deductions from all rounds:\n\nFrom my confirmed truths:\n\u2022 Player 3, Player 5, and Player 6 cannot be the criminal.\n\nLooking at others\u2019 statements:\n\u2022 P2\u2019s claims are inconsistent: In Round 1 he names Player 4, but in Rounds 2 and 3 he claims Player 6 is criminal\u2014even though we know Player 6 is not criminal. An Investigator would never make such errors. So P2 is a very likely candidate for the criminal.\n\u2022 P4\u2019s statements (\u201cPlayer 1 is not criminal\u201d in Round 1, \u201cPlayer 5 is not criminal\u201d in Round 2, and \u201cPlayer 3 is not criminal\u201d in Round 3) are all consistent with known facts and truth.\n\u2022 P6 consistently names people who are not criminals (declaring \u201cPlayer 5 is not criminal,\u201d \u201cPlayer 3 is not criminal,\u201d and \u201cPlayer 4 is not criminal\u201d in Rounds 1, 2, and 3 respectively). This consistent truth points to P6 being an Investigator.\n\u2022 P3 and P5 each make mostly true statements in earlier rounds (P3 says \u201cPlayer 5 is not criminal\u201d in Round 1 and \u201cPlayer 6 is not criminal\u201d in Round 2; P5\u2019s statements in Round 1 and Round 2, however, wrongly name Player 6 as criminal) but in Round 3 both incorrectly claim that \u201cPlayer 1 is the criminal.\u201d Given that they mistakenly believe themselves to be Investigators (if they are Rumormonger) or to be Criminals (if Lunatic) they could make such mistaken claims.\n\nSo a consistent picture is:\n\u2013 Investigators (always truthful): P1 (me), P4, and P6.\n\u2013 That leaves P2, P3, and P5 for the other roles.\n\u2022 Since Player 3, 5, and 6 are ruled out as criminal by my true statements, the only candidate for Criminal is P2.\n\u2022 P2\u2019s conflicting, incorrect statements therefore identify him as the Criminal.\n\u2022 The remaining two (P3 and P5) would then be the Rumormonger and the Lunatic (in some order).\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nStep 4.

I (Player\u00a01) have been told my role is Criminal. (Recall that only Investigators are required to state the truth when claiming someone is the Criminal.)\n\nRound\u00a01 Statements:\n\u2022 Player\u00a01 (me, Criminal) said \u201cPlayer\u00a05 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2022 Player\u00a02 said \u201cPlayer\u00a05 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2022 Player\u00a03 said \u201cPlayer\u00a02 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2022 Player\u00a04 said \u201cPlayer\u00a05 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2022 Player\u00a05 said \u201cPlayer\u00a04 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2022 Player\u00a06 said \u201cPlayer\u00a02 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\nNow, an Investigator MUST give the correct truth regarding who the Criminal is. Since I actually am Criminal, an Investigator\u2019s statement about someone being or not being Criminal must match that fact.\n\nConsider the following:\n\u2013 If Player\u00a02 were an Investigator, then their statement \u201cPlayer\u00a05 is the criminal\u201d would be true. But that would mean Player\u00a05 is the Criminal. That contradicts the fact that I (Player\u00a01) am the Criminal. So Player\u00a02 cannot be an Investigator.\n\u2013 Similarly, if Player\u00a03 were an Investigator then his statement \u201cPlayer\u00a02 is the criminal\u201d would be true. That would imply Player\u00a02 is the Criminal, which again contradicts the fact that I am Criminal. So Player\u00a03 also cannot be an Investigator.\n\u2013 Now, look at Player\u00a04\u2019s statement: \u201cPlayer\u00a05 is not the criminal.\u201d If Player\u00a04 is an Investigator, this statement is true (since the criminal is Player\u00a01). Player\u00a04 could indeed be one of the three Investigators.\n\u2013 Player\u00a05\u2019s statement \u201cPlayer\u00a04 is not the criminal\u201d is consistent with Player\u00a04\u2019s innocence as well if Player\u00a05 is an Investigator.\n\u2013 Player\u00a06\u2019s statement \u201cPlayer\u00a02 is not the criminal\u201d is also consistent with Player\u00a02 being innocent (since I am Criminal).\n\nThus, because we need exactly three Investigators and their statements must be truthful about the identity of the Criminal (i.e. they\u2019d have to point to Player\u00a01 if asked), the consistency here suggests that Players\u00a04, 5, and 6 are likely the three Investigators. That leaves Players\u00a02 and\u00a03 as the non\u2010Investigators \u2013 they are either the Rumormonger or the Lunatic (each of whom may give misleading or false statements). \n\nUnder that configuration:\n\u2022 My statement (Player\u00a01, Criminal) saying \u201cPlayer\u00a05 is the criminal\u201d is a deliberate falsehood.\n\u2022 Both Player\u00a02 (Rumormonger/Lunatic) and Player\u00a03 (Rumormonger/Lunatic) give false statements.\n\u2022 The Investigators (Players\u00a04, 5, and\u00a06) all give statements consistent with the fact that the actual Criminal is Player\u00a01.\n\nThus, based on Round\u00a01, my most likely conclusions are:\n\u2022 The actual Criminal is Player\u00a01.\n\u2022 My role is Criminal.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

The others\u2014the Rumormonger and Lunatic\u2014can happen, by chance or design, to say something that is true. At this point we still have some ambiguity regarding which of the players are Investigators versus non\u2010Investigators.

My Statement  \n\u2022 I (Player\u00a01) say \u201cPlayer\u00a05 is the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003Since I am an Investigator and always tell the truth, it must be that Player\u00a05 is the criminal.\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\nStep 2. Analysis of the Other Statements  \n\u2022 Player\u00a02 says \u201cPlayer\u00a05 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003Under the assignment where Player\u00a05 is indeed criminal, Player\u00a02\u2019s statement is false. (Thus Player\u00a02 cannot be one of the truth\u2010telling Investigators; they must be either the Rumormonger or the Lunatic.)  \n\u2022 Player\u00a03 says \u201cPlayer\u00a04 is the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003Given Player\u00a05 is criminal, this claim is false and so Player\u00a03 is not an Investigator.  \n\u2022 Player\u00a04 says \u201cPlayer\u00a01 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003That statement is true (I am not criminal), so Player\u00a04 is consistent with being an Investigator.  \n\u2022 Player\u00a05 (whom we now assign as the Criminal) says \u201cPlayer\u00a03 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003A Criminal is free to mix truth and lies; so while that statement is true (since Player\u00a03 is indeed not criminal under the current assignment), it doesn\u2019t force truthfulness as an Investigator would exhibit.  \n\u2022 Player\u00a06 says \u201cPlayer\u00a04 is the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003That claim is false under the assignment (since Player\u00a05 is the criminal), so Player\u00a06 must be either the Rumormonger or the Lunatic.\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\nStep 3. Considering the Role Distribution  \nOur game should have exactly 3 Investigators. Under the current analysis:  \n\u2003\u2013 I (Player\u00a01) am an Investigator (truthful).  \n\u2003\u2013 Player\u00a04 appears to be an Investigator (truthful).  \n\u2003\u2013 The remaining three players among Players\u00a02, 3, and 6 have made false statements.  \nA true Investigator would never make a false statement. This means none of Players\u00a02, 3, or 6 can be Investigators.  \n\nHowever, with 3 Investigators needed in the game, and with Player\u00a01 and Player\u00a04 already filling two of those spots, one additional Investigator is required. Yet in this round none of the remaining players\u2019 statements come out as truthful. From the information in Round 2 alone the only consistent truth-tellers are Players\u00a01 and 4.  \n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\nObservation  \nBecause my role (Player\u00a01) is fixed by the game instructions as Investigator, my statement must be true. This forces the conclusion that \u201cPlayer\u00a05 is the criminal.\u201d However, when we try to assign roles to all players the statements of Players\u00a02, 3, and 6 are all false\u2014which means none of them could be the required third Investigator. In other words, while the individual statements force Player\u00a05 to be the criminal, the overall truth\u2013falsehood pattern in Round 2 makes it impossible to distribute the remaining roles in a way that exactly three Investigators emerge.\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\nFinal Judgment for Round 2  \nGiven the game\u2019s instructions and the fact that I am an Investigator (so my statement \u201cPlayer\u00a05 is the criminal\u201d is necessarily true), I must commit to the conclusion dictated by my own statement even though the complete role assignment raises a distribution problem. In this round\u2019s information my best final judgment is:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 5.\nMy Role Is Investigator.\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\nNote:  \nThe apparent conflict\u2014that only two players (Players\u00a01 and 4) told truths while we require three true\u2013tellers\u2014is an inconsistency arising from the Round 2 statements. Nonetheless, since my role is given and my statement as an Investigator must be true, I must conclude that, based solely on Round 2 information, Player\u00a05 is the criminal."

Now, note that both Players 3 and 4 directly claim \u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal.\u201d Two independent claims pointing to Player 2 weigh heavily.

Review the Other Players\u2019 Statements\n\nRound 1 Statements:\n\u2022 Player 2: \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2022 Player 3: \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d (This is factually correct but does not guarantee that Player 3 is an Investigator, because non\u2010Investigators might sometimes say truths.)\n\u2022 Player 4: \u201cPlayer 3 is the criminal.\u201d Since Player 4 is not the criminal and if he is an Investigator his statement must be true.\n\u2022 Player 5: \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal.\u201d (A statement that could be true irrespective of role.)\n\u2022 Player 6: \u201cPlayer 3 is the criminal.\u201d (Again, if this comes from an Investigator it has to be true.)\n\nRound 2 Statements:\n\u2022 Player 2: \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal.\u201d (Consistent with my statement.)\n\u2022 Player 3: \u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal.\u201d (An accusation that, if coming from an Investigator, would have to be correct.

Deduce the Likely Identities\n\n\u2022 From Round 1, two players (Players 4 and 6) accuse Player 3 of being the criminal. \n  \u2013 If either Player 4 or Player 6 were Investigators, then their accusation would be definitely true.\n  \n\u2022 If we assume Player 4 is an Investigator, then his Round 1 statement \u201cPlayer 3 is the criminal\u201d is true. This fits well with our known information.\n  \n\u2022 Further, notice the consistency in Round 2:\n  \u2013 Players 2 and 4 (both likely to be our Investigators) state \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal.\u201d \n  \u2013 There is no Investigator statement that contradicts Player 3 being the criminal.\n  \n\u2022 One alternative possibility might be to consider Player 3 as an Investigator. However, that would force his Round 2 claim \u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal\u201d to be true, which would conflict with Player 4\u2019s and Player 6\u2019s earlier accusations. In addition, Player 2\u2019s Round 1 statement (\u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal\u201d) contradicts that possibility.

Evaluating the Others\u2019 Statements  \nThe remaining players (Players 2, 3, and 6) must be the non\u2010Investigator roles (one Criminal, one Rumormonger, and one Lunatic).  \n\nOur conclusion from my truthful Round 3 statement is that the criminal is Player 3.

I said \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal\u201d so I can rule out Player 6.  \n2. Two different players (Players 1 and 2) say Player 6 is not the criminal. (Player 1 is me and Player 2 might be an Investigator\u2014but I cannot yet be 100% sure about Player 2\u2019s role.)  \n3. Only one statement is a direct accusation: Player 3 states \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal.\u201d  \n4. Several other players \u201cclear\u201d someone (Player 4 says \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal\u201d and Player 5 says \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal\u201d).  \n5. Because Investigators always tell the truth, if any one of the speakers is an Investigator then their statements must be correct. Although I cannot yet pinpoint which of the other players are honest Investigators (since there are also a Rumormonger and Lunatic in the mix, whose statements might be misleading), a plausible arrangement is that three players (including me) are Investigators.\n6. One candidate assignment that fits all Round 1 statements is as follows:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Assume I (Player 1) am Investigator.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Suppose Players 2 and 5 are the other Investigators.

In this scenario the criminal would be Player 4. (Other assignments can explain the votes as well, so the evidence isn\u2019t overwhelming. But among the alternatives the singular accusation toward Player 4 carries weight.)\n\nBased on all the statements so far in Round 1, my best working guess is:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 4.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

I already have two clear truths:\n\u2003\u2022 P1 (me): \u201cP6 is not criminal\u201d (Round\u202f1) and \u201cP4 is not criminal\u201d (Round\u202f2).\nWe must then find one more player whose statements are entirely \u201ctrue.\u201d\n\nConsider the possibilities:\n1. If we hypothesize that Player\u202f3 is the criminal, then:\n\u2003\u2013 Round\u202f2: Player\u202f3\u2019s \u201cPlayer\u202f1 is the criminal\u201d becomes a deflection (a lie from the criminal).\n\u2003\u2013 Look at Player\u202f4: In Round\u202f1 P4 said \u201cPlayer\u202f2 is not criminal\u201d (true if criminal is P3) and in Round\u202f2 P4 said \u201cPlayer\u202f3 is criminal\u201d \u2013 both statements come out correct. This makes P4 an Investigator.\n\u2003\u2013 Check Player\u202f6: In Round\u202f1 P6 said \u201cPlayer\u202f1 is not criminal\u201d and in Round\u202f2 P6 said \u201cPlayer\u202f5 is not criminal.\u201d Both are correct if criminal is P3. So P6 could also be an Investigator.\n\u2003\u2003Thus one possible assignment is: Investigators = Players 1, 4, and 6; Criminal = Player\u202f3; and the remaining two (Players 2 and 5) are non-investigators (the Rumormonger and Lunatic), whose statements may mix truth and falsehood.\n\n2. (For completeness, one might also \u201cfit\u201d another candidate such as Player\u202f2 being criminal. However, then note:\n\u2003\u2013 P4\u2019s statements in Round\u202f2 (\u201cPlayer\u202f3 is criminal\u201d) would be false, so P4 couldn\u2019t be an Investigator. That forces the set of always-truthful players into a mix that is less natural given my own safe clears (of P4 and P6) and the deflections seen from P3. Also, Player\u202f3 making a false accusation in Round\u202f1 and Round\u202f2 fits well with the behavior we\u2019d expect from the criminal in deflecting blame.) \n\nWhen I weigh the evidence, the statements from Round\u202f2 stand out: \n\u2003\u2013 Player\u202f3 accuses me, which is a clear falsehood coming from someone who can lie (and as the criminal, deflection is typical).\n\u2003\u2013 Player\u202f4 \u2013 whom I know is not criminal and whose statements check out \u2013 directly names Player\u202f3. \n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nThus, the weight of evidence is best explained if Player\u202f3 is the criminal and the always\u2013truthful Investigators are Players 1, 4, and 6.\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nTherefore, my conclusion after Round\u202f2 is:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 3.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

Given that P5\u2019s claim conflicts with a consensus that P6 is not criminal (from my statement, plus from P4 and P6 themselves), P5\u2019s claim is suspect.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Since P2\u2019s claim that P5 is the criminal does not conflict with any confirmed true statements and fits with the pattern that Investigators always tell the truth (and must include me along with two others), it is most likely that P2 is truly stating what he knows.\n\n\u2022 Therefore, the most consistent conclusion is that Player 5 is the criminal.

Player\u202f2 says, \u201cPlayer\u202f1 is not the criminal.\u201d (This is a true fact regardless, but we don\u2019t yet know Player\u202f2\u2019s role. If Player\u202f2 were an Investigator they\u2019d be obliged to tell the truth\u2014but if not, it might be an accidental true statement.)\n\n3. Player\u202f3 also says, \u201cPlayer\u202f4 is not the criminal.\u201d This reinforces my statement.\n\n4. Player\u202f4 says, \u201cPlayer\u202f2 is not the criminal.\u201d If Player\u202f4 were an Investigator (and since I already know Player\u202f4 isn\u2019t the criminal, he could be one of the truth\u2010telling Investigators), then his statement must be correct and Player\u202f2 is innocent.\n\n5. Player\u202f5 again states, \u201cPlayer\u202f4 is not the criminal.\u201d That extra support further confirms that Player\u202f4 cannot be the criminal.\n\n6. Finally, Player\u202f6 says, \u201cPlayer\u202f2 is the criminal.\u201d Notice this directly contradicts Player\u202f4\u2019s statement. Since we expect that if Player\u202f4 is an Investigator his statement is necessarily truthful, it would follow that Player\u202f2 is not criminal.

(Remember that among non\u2010Investigator roles\u2014the Criminal, Rumormonger, and Lunatic\u2014the statements can be misleading or arbitrary.)\n\nBecause there is a strong consensus from three different players (myself, Player\u202f3, and Player\u202f5) that Player\u202f4 is not the criminal, and with Player\u202f4\u2019s own statement reinforcing Player\u202f2\u2019s innocence, the only remaining candidate in the conflict is Player\u202f6. In other words, if Player\u202f4\u2019s statement is to be trusted (and it must be if Player\u202f4 is an Investigator), then Player\u202f6\u2019s claim is a lie. Given that criminal players are allowed some deceptive freedom, the simplest explanation is that Player\u202f6 is the Criminal.\n\nBased solely on Round 1\u2019s information\u2014and using my own truth-telling Investigator insight\u2014I have reason to conclude:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 6.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

Recap of Known Facts\n\n\u2022 I am Player 1 and know I am an Investigator. As such, my statements are always truthful with respect to criminal identification.\n\u2022 There are exactly 3 Investigators, 1 Criminal, 1 Rumormonger (who thinks they are an Investigator but may be wrong) and 1 Lunatic (who thinks they are Criminal but can say either truth or falsehood).\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nStep 2. Round 1 Summary\n\n1. P1: \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 As an Investigator, I guarantee that Player 4 is innocent.\n2. P2: \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 True statement, though we don\u2019t yet know P2\u2019s role.\n3. P3: \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Reinforces that Player 4 is indeed innocent.\n4. P4: \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal.\u201d\n5. P5: \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Again, supporting P4\u2019s innocence.\n6. P6: \u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 This contradicts P4 (if we were to consider P4\u2019s statement as truthful) and raises suspicion about P6\u2019s statement.\n\nOn the basis of Round 1 alone, with a strong consensus that P4 is not criminal, the odd one out is P6 accusing P2. (Also note that while non-Investigators can issue either true or false statements, the accident of several consistent statements from me (P1), P3, and P5 gives a reliable baseline. Hence, Round 1 hinted that P6 might be the Criminal.)\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nStep 3. Round 2 Statements Analysis\n\n1. P1: \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Again, as Investigator, this is a truthful statement. So P5 is innocent.\n2. P2: \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 If P2 is an Investigator, his statement must be true. This is consistent with Round 1\u2019s suspicion from P6.\n3. P3: \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 This is consistent with what we know and does not add any conflict.\n4. P4: \u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Note here that in Round 1, P4 said \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal.\u201d As a player who is not guaranteed to always tell the truth (if not an Investigator), this inconsistency suggests P4 is not an Investigator. He must be either the Rumormonger or the Lunatic.\n5. P5: \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 This is true.\n6. P6: \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Again, a statement consistent with what we know, though by itself it is not very informative.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nStep 4. Putting It All Together\n\nKey points:\n\u2022 My own statements (P1) are reliable. I have declared in Round 1 that P4 is not the criminal and in Round 2 that P5 is not the criminal.\n\u2022 P3 and P5\u2019s statements in Round 1 support P4\u2019s innocence.\n\u2022 There is a noteworthy pattern: Two separate players (P2 in Round 2 and P6 in Round 1) point toward someone else being the criminal. P6 in Round 1 accused P2, while in Round 2 P2 accuses P6.\n\u2022 If we assume that the bulk of evidence coming from statements by likely Investigators (which includes myself and probably P2 and P3 who demonstrate consistency) is reliable, then P2\u2019s Round 2 claim that \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal\u201d should be taken at face value.\n\u2022 Also, notice that repeated confirmations of innocence (P1, P3, and P5 all declare non-criminal statuses for other players) leave P6 as the most viable candidate for the Criminal role.\n\nIt is worth noting that P4\u2019s contradictory statements (switching from \u201cP2 is not the criminal\u201d to \u201cP2 is criminal\u201d) further confirm that P4 is not one of the consistently truthful Investigators. This reinforces our reliance on the accounts provided by those we have strong reason to trust.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nFinal Conclusion\n\nBased on all available statements from Rounds 1 and 2, the evidence consistently points toward Player 6 as the criminal. My identified role remains that of an Investigator, which gives me certainty about the truthfulness of my statements.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 6.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

Confirmed Innocents via Investigator Statements:\n\u2003\u2013 P1 (me) is innocent (I\u2019m the Investigator).\n\u2003\u2013 From Round 1, I declared \u201cP4 is not the criminal\u201d and P3 and P5 in Round 1 also backed up P4\u2019s innocence.\n\u2003\u2013 Round 2: I stated \u201cP5 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2013 Round 3: I stated \u201cP3 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\nThus, Players 3, 4, and 5 are all innocent. This leaves only P2 and P6 as possible criminals.\n\n2. Evaluating Accusations:\n\u2003\u2013 P6 in Rounds 1 and 3 consistently says, \u201cPlayer\u202f2 is the criminal.\u201d If we trust P6\u2019s consistency, then P2 becomes our key suspect.\n\u2003\u2013 In Round 3, P3 (who we trust as an Investigator) also states \u201cPlayer\u202f2 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2013 P2 himself, in Round 3, accuses me (\u201cPlayer\u202f1 is the criminal\u201d), which is a false accusation. An Investigator would not do that, so P2 cannot be an Investigator. (It\u2019s acceptable for the Criminal to lie.)\n\u2003\u2013 P4 and P5 each accuse me in Round 3, but given their earlier mixed statements and the fact that they\u2019re already ruled out as criminal (by earlier truthful Investigator statements), these can be understood as noise from non-Investigator roles.\n\n3. Proposed Role Assignments Given these Inferences:\n\u2003\u2022 Investigators (truthful): P1 (me), P3, and P6.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Check: P3\u2019s Round 3 statement \u201cPlayer\u202f2 is the criminal\u201d is truthful if P2 is indeed the criminal.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 P6\u2019s Round 1 and Round 3 statements also correctly accuse Player\u202f2.\n\u2003\u2022 Criminal: P2.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 P2\u2019s statements (e.g., claiming \u201cPlayer\u202f1 is not criminal\u201d in Round 1, \u201cPlayer\u202f6 is criminal\u201d in Round 2, and \u201cPlayer\u202f1 is criminal\u201d in Round 3) show a mix of truths and falsehoods; these are permissible for the Criminal.\n\u2003\u2022 The remaining two (P4 and P5) must be the Rumormonger and the Lunatic. Their statements are inconsistent (for example, P4\u2019s shift from \u201cP2 is not criminal\u201d in Round 1 to \u201cP2 is criminal\u201d in Round 2, and then accusing P1 in Round 3; similar ambiguity is seen with P5), which fits their roles of being less reliable.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nFinal Conclusion:\n\nGiven all three rounds of statements and the consistent truth-telling by known Investigators (including my own statements), the evidence points to Player 2 being the criminal.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 2.\nMy Role Is Investigator."
