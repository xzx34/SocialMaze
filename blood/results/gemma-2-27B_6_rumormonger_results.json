It's possible they're all being misled, or that they are trying to deflect.\n\nConsidering all the information, my initial suspicion of Player 4 as the criminal seems less likely.

If they are anything else, they are lying.\n*   **Player 4 says Player 6 is not the criminal.** This *could* be true, or a lie.\n*   **Player 5 says Player 2 is not the criminal.** This *could* be true, or a lie.\n*   **Player 6 says Player 3 is not the criminal.** This *could* be true, or a lie.\n\nLet's consider the implications if Player 3 *is* an Investigator:\n\n*   If Player 3 is an Investigator, then I (Player 1) *am* the Criminal. This is consistent with my knowledge.\n*   This would mean Players 2, 4, 5, and 6 are all lying. This is plausible, as they could be the Criminal, Rumormonger and/or Lunatic.\n\nLet's consider the implications if Player 3 is *not* an Investigator:\n\n*   If Player 3 is lying, then I (Player 1) am *not* the Criminal. But I *know* I am, so this is a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, the most likely scenario is that Player 3 *is* an Investigator. This puts a large target on my back, so I need to be very careful in subsequent rounds.\n\nGiven that 4 Investigators exist, and we've tentatively identified one (Player 3), there are three more. Players 2, 4, 5 and 6 are suspects for the remaining roles.\n\nBased on this limited information, I'll assume for now I am indeed the Criminal, and Player 3 is an Investigator.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role "

However, given that Investigators *always* tell the truth, and Player 3 consistently accused me (the Criminal) of being the criminal, it's highly probable Player 3 is an Investigator despite Player 5's statement. Player 5 is likely lying, and therefore is either the Criminal, Rumormonger, or Lunatic.\n\nPlayer 6's statement is significant. Accusing me directly is risky unless they are confident, or are trying to create confusion as the Criminal or Lunatic.\n\nConsidering the roles: We have at least one confirmed Investigator (likely Player 3) and one Criminal (me - Player 1). We need to identify the Rumormonger and the remaining Investigators.\n\nIf Player 6 is the Criminal, they're being rather obvious. If they're the Rumormonger, they're failing at appearing like an Investigator.

This suggests Player 5 is trying to create confusion.\n* **Player 6 defends Player 2:** Consistent with Player 2's defense of Player 6.\n\nConsidering everything, I think my initial assessment of Player 5 being the criminal is strengthening. If Player 5 *were* an investigator or rumormonger, they would likely confirm my accusation, or at least not actively defend Player 3. Defending Player 3 after being accused of being the criminal in Round 1 strongly suggests guilt.\n\nLet's consider the roles:\n\n* **If I am an Investigator:** My statements are true. Player 5 is the criminal.\n* **If Player 4 is an Investigator:** Their statement about Player 6 being the criminal would be true, creating another criminal. This contradicts the game rules.\n* **If Player 2 is an Investigator:** Their statement about Player 6 being innocent would be true.\n* **If Player 6 is an Investigator:** Their statement about Player 2 being innocent would be true.\n* **If Player 3 is an Investigator:** Their statement about me being innocent would be true.\n\nThe conflict between Player 2 and Player 4 is the most significant point. One of them *must* be lying. If Player 5 is the criminal, Player 4 could be a Rumormonger making an incorrect accusation.\n\nBased on the accumulating evidence, I\u2019m increasingly confident in my assessment.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 5.\nMy Role Is I"

Players 2, 4, and 5 are all stating that *I* (Player 1) am not the criminal. This is highly suspicious. If I *am* an investigator, and therefore truthful, then these players are either also investigators, or are trying very hard to deflect suspicion from myself.\n\nPlayer 3 states Player 6 is not the criminal. Player 6 states Player 3 is not the criminal. This reciprocal \"not criminal\" statement could indicate a couple of things: they are both innocent, or they are working together to mislead.\n\nThe continued accusations (from Round 1) against Player 4 are now less prominent. No one accused Player 4 in Round 2.\n\nLet's consider the roles. We know there are 4 Investigators, 1 Criminal, and 1 Rumormonger. The Rumormonger *believes* they are an Investigator but is lying. The fact that three players (2, 4, and 5) are consistently defending me makes me suspect one of them is the Rumormonger. They *think* they\u2019re being a good investigator by protecting a perceived \u201cinvestigator\u201d (me), but are actually spreading misinformation.\n\nThe fact that Player 6 defends Player 3 is also interesting. It could be a genuine attempt to clear an innocent, or a calculated move.\n\nGiven the consistent defense from Players 2, 4, and 5, and the diminishing focus on Player 4, I\u2019m shifting my suspicion toward Player 6. It\u2019s possible Player 6 is the Criminal and is attempting to muddy the waters by accusing others (in Round 1) and deflecting attention by protecting Player 3.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 6.\nMy Role Is I"

Player 5 would be lying, which is consistent with the Criminal role. Player 3 and Player 4 would be telling the truth, consistent with the Investigator role.\n\nLet's consider the implications if Player 5 *isn't* the criminal: Players 2 and 6 would be lying, which is consistent with the Criminal or Rumormonger roles.

However, it's too early to be certain about my role. It's possible I am a Rumormonger who got lucky.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 5.\nMy Role"

The consistency of Player 6\u2019s statements, coupled with Player 5\u2019s potential lie, strengthens this conclusion.

Player 2 and Player 6 have both stated Player 3 is *not* the criminal in both rounds. This consistency is interesting. Investigators would be consistent, but Rumormongers *could* be consistent by chance.\n\nPlayers 4 and 5 both state Player 6 is not the criminal in Round 2, mirroring Player 4's statement in Round 1. This is another point of consistency.\n\nI, as the Criminal, am continuing to lie. My statements are intended to deflect suspicion.\n\nIf Player 3 is a Rumormonger, their accusation of Player 4 is likely false. If Player 3 is a Lunatic, it could be true or false.\n\nGiven the consistency of P2/P6 and P4/P5 protecting P6, I suspect P6 might be the Rumormonger. It's unusual for two players to consistently defend the same person unless they are colluding (which isn\u2019t possible) or one is trying to protect the other because they believe the other is an investigator. Since Rumormongers *think* they are Investigators, it's plausible.\n\nI still believe Player 6 is a strong contender for a non-Investigator role.

This means Players 2 and 3 are likely Investigators as well, supporting Player 4's claim. Player 6 is most likely a Rumormonger or Lunatic. Player 5 is potentially innocent.\n* **If Player 4 is a Rumormonger/Lunatic:** They are making a random accusation. Player 6 is also likely a Rumormonger/Lunatic with inconsistent statements. Players 2 & 3 could be anything.\n\nBased on the greater consistency of Players 2 & 3, and the direct accusation by Player 4, I am leaning towards Player 4 being an Investigator.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role "

However, because I know I am the criminal, this is a misdirection. The strong defensive bloc *is* the misdirection.\n\nThe continued accusations against me in the prior rounds, while I consistently deflect, suggest I'm successfully fulfilling my role.

This is *very* suspicious. It strongly suggests Player 2 is *not* a reliable source of truth (i.e., not an Investigator). It could be a Rumormonger or the other criminal.\n\nPlayers 3, 4, 5 and 6 all seem to be aligning in defenses, creating a bloc. This is a classic misdirection tactic.\n\nThe fact that I (the Criminal) and Player 5 both defended Player 4 is also noteworthy. It\u2019s either a coincidence, or Player 5 and I are subtly signaling to each other, or we're both being manipulated by a third party.\n\nConsidering the game roles, we have 4 Investigators, 1 Criminal (me), and 1 Rumormonger. We\u2019ve likely identified Player 2 as the Rumormonger given their inconsistent statements.\n\nI still believe I am the only criminal, and the group of 3,4,5,6 are likely investigators or the rumormonger.\n\n**Revised Assessment:**\n\nPlayer 2 is almost certainly the Rumormonger.

This could be a genuine Investigator, or a desperate Criminal trying to frame me.\n\nThe fact that Player 6 called me out so directly makes me suspect they are either an investigator or a lunatic. A Rumormonger would likely be more subtle. Given that I know I\u2019m the criminal, and I\u2019m being directly accused, I need to reassess. It's possible I underestimated Player 6. However, the consistent pattern of deflection by Players 2, 3, 4, and 5 remains suspicious.\n\nI still lean towards Player 5 as the more likely criminal due to their initial, unfounded accusation and continued deflection.

However, if Player 4 is a Lunatic, they believe they are the criminal and would be less likely to point the finger at someone else so directly. It's more likely Player 4 is a Rumormonger trying to mislead.\n\nLet's re-evaluate Player 3. They consistently defend Player 6. This could be because Player 6 is an Investigator trying to protect themselves, or Player 3 is protecting an ally (which would mean Player 3 and Player 6 are both Rumormongers or Lunatics).\n\nPlayer 2 and 5's statements are still inconclusive.\n\nGiven the strong accusation from Player 4, I am leaning towards Player 4 being an Investigator. This means I remain the Criminal. It also means Player 3 is likely a Rumormonger (or potentially a Lunatic, but less likely).\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role "

If they are *both* Investigators, it's a very strong confirmation. However, it could also be a coordinated effort by two non-Investigators to mislead.\n\nLet's consider possibilities:\n\n*   **If I were to assume Player 4 and 5 are both Investigators:** This means I *am* being correctly identified. This is bad for me.\n*   **If Player 4 is an Investigator and Player 5 is lying:** This is also bad for me.\n*   **If Player 4 is lying and Player 5 is an Investigator:** Still bad for me.\n*   **If both are lying:** This is the best-case scenario for me. It suggests there's a conspiracy to point at me.\n\nSince I know I am the criminal, I\u2019m going to lean towards the idea that at least one of players 4 and 5 are telling the truth. Player 6 defends Player 4.\n\nGiven this limited information, my initial assessment is that the most likely criminal is still me (Player 1), as I know I am. I believe I am the criminal.

A defense of themselves, potentially.\n*   **Player 6 says Player 5 is not the criminal.** - Consistent with Round 1, further suggesting a pattern.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nPlayer 3 now directly accuses me.

The Criminal would directly accuse an investigator to sow discord.\n\nPlayer 2 and Player 6 both defend Player 4. This could be a coordinated effort to mislead, or they could genuinely believe Player 4 is innocent.\n\nPlayer 5 shifting the accusation to Player 6 is also noteworthy. It could be an attempt to deflect, or they could be genuinely trying to identify the criminal.\n\nConsidering all the evidence, I still believe Player 3 is the most likely candidate for either the Criminal or a Lunatic. The accusation against me is too direct and risky for a normal Investigator or Rumormonger. My initial assessment of Player 5 being the criminal seems less likely now.\n\nI remain confident in my role as an Investigator, as my statements have been consistent and truthful.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 3.\nMy Role Is I"

P2 is now directly accusing P5. P3, P4, and P6 all defend P5. This creates a strong block of players around P5. My statement (P1) continues the deflection strategy.\n\nLet's consider the possibilities:\n\n*   **P5 is the Criminal:** If P5 is the criminal, P2 is an Investigator and P3, P4, and P6 are either Investigators or the Rumormonger. This is plausible.\n*   **P2 is the Rumormonger:** P2 making a direct accusation could be a Rumormonger trying to seem like an Investigator. But then P3, P4, and P6 would have to be truthful investigators, and that feels unlikely given the game composition.\n*   **P2, P3, P4, and P6 are Investigators protecting the Criminal (P5):** This is less likely, as it requires a coordinated effort and doesn't explain P6's accusation of me in Round 1.\n*   **P5 is being deliberately protected by multiple players:** This could be a deliberate strategy by either the Criminal or Rumormonger to draw suspicion *away* from them.\n\nRemembering that I am the Criminal, I want to sow confusion. The cluster around P5 is suspicious. If I were trying to misdirect, I'd highlight that cluster.\n\nConsidering P6's accusation of me in Round 1, and their defense of P5 in Round 2, P6 is looking increasingly like the Rumormonger. They're jumping around, seemingly contradicting themselves.\n\nIt's still possible P5 is the Criminal, but the coordinated defense is making me lean toward a more complex scenario where P5 is being protected.\n\nGiven I am the criminal and want to throw off suspicion, I will stick with my initial assessment and try to reinforce the idea that P6 is the problem.\n\n**Final Judgment:**\n\nFinal Criminal Is Player 6.\nMy Role "

A true investigator wouldn't immediately jump on a bandwagon accusation after initially accusing me and then defending P5. The Rumormonger is flailing and trying to appear decisive. P4 joining in on the accusation of me feels like they are being influenced by P6, or are another misguided player.\n\nP2\u2019s accusation of P3 is a curveball. It could be a genuine attempt to find the criminal, or another misdirection. However, the fact that P5 immediately defends P3 reinforces the idea of a protective circle around those players.\n\nGiven the game composition (4 Investigators, 1 Criminal, 1 Rumormonger), the protective circle around P3, P5, and potentially P2 indicates they are likely Investigators.\n\nMy strategy as the Criminal is to continue deflecting and to reinforce the idea that P6 is unreliable.\n\n**Final Judgment:**\n\nFinal Criminal Is Player 6.\nMy Role "

Player 4 defends Player 3.\n\n**Updated Role Deductions:**\n\n*   **Player 5:** Initially suspected of being an Investigator due to the Round 1 accusation against me. Now, *two* players are accusing them. This makes it less likely they are a straight-up Investigator. They could be a Rumormonger who got it wrong in Round 1 and is now sticking to a false belief, or even a Lunatic pretending to be the criminal and making conflicting statements.\n*   **Players 2, 5, 6:** They form a group denying involvement for each other. This is suspicious.

They initially believed the narrative I and Player 3 created, but lack the consistent truth-telling ability of an Investigator.\n*   **Players 2, 5, 6:** This block remains highly suspicious.

It\u2019s a direct hit. Player 3\u2019s reversal is also critical; it points to a lack of reliable information processing - a hallmark of the Rumormonger. The P2/P5/P6 block continues to be a source of confusion. I'm still focusing on deflection, but the net is closing in.\n\nGiven the information, maintaining the accusation against Player 5 is less tenable.

(If I'm an Investigator, this is truthful.)\n* **Player 4\u2019s statement:** Continues to claim I am not the criminal. This reinforces the belief that Player 4 is lying and therefore *is* the criminal (from our analysis in Round 2). This new statement directly contradicts my claim in Round 2, and therefore must be a lie.\n* **Players 2, 3, & 5:** All state Player 6 is *not* the criminal. This is a strong pattern.\n* **Player 6:** States Player 3 is not the criminal.\n\nThe shift in my accusation from Player 4 to Player 2 is significant and requires careful consideration. If I am truly an Investigator, this indicates Player 2 is the criminal. But why the change? It could be a Rumormonger effect \u2013 a misinterpretation of the evidence. However, the consistent defense of Player 6 by Players 2, 3, and 5 feels deliberate, almost like a coordinated effort to distract from Player 6.\n\nLet's re-evaluate Player 4: The continued lying by Player 4 strongly suggests they *are* the criminal. However, the new information about Player 2 being the criminal cannot be ignored. It's possible Player 4 is working *with* the real criminal (Player 2) to create confusion.\n\nThe fact that Player 4 still denies my statements (even after I correctly identified them as a liar in Round 2) is incredibly telling. It implies a desperate attempt to deflect suspicion.\n\nConsidering everything, I believe the initial judgment pointing to Player 4 as the criminal was more accurate. My statement in Round 3 might be a misdirection \u2013 either due to a Rumormonger effect (if I am one) or a deliberate attempt by the real criminal (Player 4) to mislead me. The consistent defense of Player 6 by others is likely a red herring.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 4.\nMy Role Is I"

If all were Investigators, it would be conclusive. However, we know there are only 4 Investigators. This suggests at least one of them is a Rumormonger.\n\n\n\n**Deductions:**\n\n*   Player 6 is almost certainly the Criminal.\n*   Player 4 is likely an Investigator, or the Rumormonger attempting to protect Player 3 initially.\n*   Players 1, 2, and 3\u2019s agreement is too convenient.

P5 & P6 both state P6 is not the criminal.\n\nP3 accusing *me* (P1) in Round 2 is a crucial piece of information. It significantly changes the dynamic. If P3 were an Investigator, they'd be telling the truth, which is impossible since I *am* the Criminal. Therefore, P3 is *not* an Investigator. They are either a Rumormonger or a Lunatic.\n\nP2 is consistently defending people (P6 in Round 1, P3 in Round 2). This could indicate they *are* an investigator, but it could also suggest a Rumormonger who is consistently wrong.\n\nP4 and P5 are both defending players. P4 defended P2 and P5 defended P6. P6 also defended P5. This grouping of defenses is interesting. It could be that they are all investigators, or a mix of roles.\n\nP5 and P6 both saying P6 is not the criminal is interesting. If one of them is an investigator, P6 is likely innocent.\n\nMy statement (P1) accusing P2 is a strategic move to deflect suspicion.\n\nConsidering everything, P3\u2019s direct accusation of me is the most significant data point. It strongly suggests P3 is either a very confused Rumormonger or a Lunatic. The consistency of P2's defenses and P5/P6's defenses also stand out.\n\nI still can't definitively pinpoint the Criminal beyond myself. However, I'm starting to lean towards P3 being a non-investigator (Rumormonger or Lunatic).\n\n**Final Judgment:**\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role "

A Rumormonger might make one incorrect accusation, but to persist despite the lack of corroborating evidence feels more Lunatic-like. Lunatics believe they are Criminals, and might fixate on accusing someone they perceive as a threat.\n\nP4 accusing P6 is a wildcard. It could be a genuine deduction, or a deliberate attempt to muddy the waters.\n\nP5 defending P4 is also interesting, given that P4 accused P6. This suggests P4 and P5 are either both Investigators or are colluding to mislead.\n\nGiven all this, the most logical conclusion is that P3 is the Lunatic, constantly (and incorrectly) accusing me. The consistency of P2's defenses and the mutual defense of P5 and P6 makes them strong candidates for Investigators. P4's accusation of P6 feels like a distraction.\n\nSince I *know* I am the criminal, and P3 is consistently wrong, it reinforces that I\u2019m successfully diverting suspicion.\n\n**Final Judgment:**\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role "

Their behavior is inconsistent, and they are now falling in line with a defensive strategy.\n*   **Player 3:** *Highly* likely to be the Lunatic.

The fact that I did suggests I am *not* a truthful Investigator.\n\nLet's consider the possibilities:\n\n*   **I am a Rumormonger:** This fits perfectly. I believe I am an Investigator, but I am providing incorrect information. My shifting accusations are consistent with this role.\n*   **I am the Criminal:** This is less likely. Criminals typically try to deflect, not make direct and changing accusations.\n*   **I am an Investigator:** This is now highly improbable given the contradictory statements.\n\nNow, let's look at the other players. Player 6 states Player 3 is not the criminal. If Player 3 *is* the criminal (as I stated in Round 3), Player 6 is lying. This is consistent with Player 6 being the Criminal.\n\nPlayers 4 and 5 also state Player 6 is not the criminal. This would make them liars as well, if Player 6 is the criminal.\n\nConsidering everything, it seems I have been misinterpreting my role. I believe I am a Rumormonger, and Player 6 is the Criminal.

Player 6\u2019s statements are also consistent.\n\nGiven that I'm an investigator, and my Round 2 statement is true, Player 6 is innocent. This means the criminal must be one of Players 2, 3, 4 or 5.\n\nSince there are 4 Investigators, 1 Criminal, and 1 Rumormonger, and I believe I am an Investigator, let's consider the possibility that Player 6 is the Rumormonger. They believe they are an investigator but are providing incorrect information.\n\nIf Player 3 is the Criminal, then their statement in Round 1 (Player 5 isn't the criminal) *could* be a lie, and their Round 2 statement (Player 4 isn't the criminal) could also be a lie.

But my Round 2 statement appears correct, which is consistent with being an investigator.\n\nLet\u2019s assume for now that I *am* an investigator.

This is a significant shift from my previous judgments, and forces a reassessment.\n\nHere's a complete overview:\n\n**Round 1:**\n*   P1: P2 is not the criminal (TRUE - Assuming I'm an Investigator)\n*   P2: P4 is not the criminal\n*   P3: P4 is not the criminal\n*   P4: P2 is not the criminal\n*   P5: P3 is not the criminal\n*   P6: P3 is not the criminal\n\n**Round 2:**\n*   P1: P5 is not the criminal (TRUE - Assuming I'm an Investigator)\n*   P2: P3 is not the criminal\n*   P3: P6 is not the criminal\n*   P4: P6 is the criminal\n*   P5: P3 is not the criminal\n*   P6: P2 is the criminal\n\n**Round 3:**\n*   P1: P4 is not the criminal (TRUE - Assuming I'm an Investigator)\n*   P2: P5 is not the criminal\n*   P3: P5 is not the criminal\n*   P4: P5 is not the criminal\n*   P5: P2 is not the criminal\n*   P6: P3 is the criminal\n\nThe fact that my statement in Round 3 directly contradicts my previous conclusion \u2013 that Player 4 is the criminal \u2013 is crucial. This suggests I may *not* be an Investigator. If I were an Investigator, my statements would be consistently truthful.\n\nLet's re-evaluate. Players 2, 3, and 4 all exonerate Player 5. Player 5 exonerates Player 2. This could be a coordinated effort, or it could be the Rumormonger and/or Lunatic influencing the group.\n\nPlayer 6 consistently makes accusations (Player 3 in Round 3, Player 2 in Round 2). This is consistent with the behavior of a Lunatic who *believes* they are the criminal and is attempting to deflect. The accusation of Player 3 in Round 3 feels like a last-ditch effort to throw suspicion elsewhere.\n\nGiven my potentially false statements, I must consider the possibility that I am the Rumormonger. However, the accusations from Player 6 seem more consistent with the Lunatic role.\n\nTherefore, I now believe Player 6 is the Criminal. The consistent accusations, combined with my realization that I may not be an Investigator, lead me to this conclusion. If I'm a Rumormonger, I've been consistently wrong, and Player 6\u2019s behavior fits the criminal profile.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 6.\nMy Role"

In Round 2, Player 4 accuses Player 2. If Player 4 *is* the criminal, this is a lie, meaning Player 2 is *not* the criminal. This is consistent.\n\nHowever, let's look at Player 3. In Round 1, Player 3 said Player 6 is not the criminal, and in Round 2, Player 3 says Player 5 is not the criminal. If Player 3 is an Investigator, both statements are true.

If Player 4 is the Criminal, this is a lie, meaning Player 6 is *not* the criminal. This creates a direct conflict.\n\nIf Player 6 were the criminal, Player 6 would be lying when they say Player 5 is not the criminal.\n\nLet's consider the implications if Player 4 is *not* the Criminal.

But if I am *not* an Investigator (perhaps a Rumormonger), my accusation could be false, making Player 4\u2019s statement more credible.\n\nPlayer 3 stating I am not the criminal is interesting.

But if I am an investigator, Player 3 is lying.\n\nLooking at the consistency of statements, Player 2 and Player 5 consistently state others are *not* the criminal. This could point to them being Rumormongers or Lunatics.\n\nGiven that both Player 1 and Player 4 accuse Player 6, and if I am, in fact, an Investigator, the most logical conclusion is that Player 6 is the criminal. However, the fact that I accused Player 6 after previously suspecting Player 4 makes me question my own role. It's possible I'm a Rumormonger being misled.\n\nHowever, sticking with the most consistent deductions, and assuming my initial role is correct, I'm going to stick with Player 6 being the criminal.

It's also possible Player 6 is another misguided role, but less likely given the consistent clearing of Player 6 by others.\n4. **Player 2 appears to be an Investigator.** Their accusation of Player 5 in Round 2 and their defense of me in multiple rounds is consistent with truthful information.\n5. **Player 4 is also likely an Investigator.** They consistently clear Player 6 and Player 3, aligning with known innocents.\n\nRole Confirmation:\n\nWe have:\n* Me (Player 1): Investigator\n* Player 2: Likely Investigator\n* Player 3: Likely Rumormonger\n* Player 4: Likely Investigator\n* Player 5: Likely Criminal\n* Player 6: Unknown - but leaning towards Investigator since they consistently clear others.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 5.\n"
