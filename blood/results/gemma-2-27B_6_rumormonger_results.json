This contradicts their previous statement in Round 2, where they believed Player 6 was innocent. This inconsistency raises suspicion about Player 2's reliability.\n* **Player 3:** Accuses me (Player 1) of being the criminal. This is the third time they've accused someone of being the criminal, and it further solidifies their suspicious behavior.\n* **Player 4:** Re-iterates their accusation of Player 5 being the criminal. This consistency, while not conclusive, adds weight to their statement.\n* **Player 5:** States Player 3 is not the criminal. This directly contradicts Player 3's accusation of me (Player 1) and aligns with Player 5's previous accusation against Player 3.\n* **Player 6:** Confirms I (Player 1) am not the criminal. This supports my previous statements and strengthens the case against Player 3.\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\nPlayer 3 is the most likely culprit. Their consistent accusations, coupled with contradictions from other players, strongly suggests they are either the Criminal or a Rumormonger.\n\nWhile Player 4 accuses Player 5, their statement lacks the same consistency and support as the accusations against Player 3.\n\n**Final Judgment:**\nFinal Criminal Is Player 3.\nMy Role Is Investigator. \n\n\n\n\nLet me know if you'd like to play another round!"

This aligns with Player 6's initial accusation but contradicts Player 2's statement.\n\n* **Player 4:** Says Player 3 is not the criminal. This aligns with Player 5 and Player 6's statements.\n\n* **Player 5:** States Player 3 is not the criminal. This aligns with Player 4 and Player 6's statements.\n\n* **Player 6:** Says Player 3 is not the criminal. This aligns with Player 4 and Player 5's statements.\n\n**Final Observations:**\n\n* My inconsistent statements make it highly unlikely I am an Investigator. I'm likely either a Rumormonger or a Lunatic.\n\n* Player 3 has been repeatedly accused (by myself and Player 3) but also denied by multiple players.\n\n* The fact that Players 4, 5, and 6 all agree that Player 3 is not the criminal is significant. It suggests they might be working together, or at least have some shared information.\n\n**Possible Scenarios:**\n\n1. Player 3 is the Rumormonger: They are trying to deflect suspicion by accusing others while also denying their own guilt.\n\n2. Player 3 is the Lunatic: They are making seemingly random accusations and denials, potentially to confuse the other players.\n\n\n3. Player 6 is the Criminal:\n\nThey initially accused Player 2, but now that Player 2 has been cleared by other players, they might be trying to shift suspicion.\n\n**Round 3 Judgment:**\n\nFinal Judgment:\n\nFinal Criminal Is Player 6.\nMy Role Is Rumormonger. \n\nConsidering my inconsistent statements and the pattern of accusations, I believe I am most likely the Rumormonger. While Player 3 is a strong suspect, the consistent denials from other players make me lean towards Player 6 as the Criminal."

As an Investigator, this is truthful. This reaffirms my initial suspicion that Player 3 or 4 is the Criminal.\n* **Player 2:** States Player 1 is not the criminal. This could be truthful, as they might be an Investigator. However, it could also be a Rumormonger trying to build trust.\n* **Player 3:** States Player 6 is not the criminal. This is interesting as they previously accused Player 4. Could be an attempt to mislead or a genuine shift in suspicion.\n* **Player 4:** States Player 5 is not the criminal. This doesn't help us much, as they could be anyone.\n* **Player 5:** States Player 1 is not the criminal. Similar to Player 2, this could be truthful or a deceptive tactic.\n* **Player 6:** States Player 2 is not the criminal. Again, this doesn't give us much concrete information.\n\n**Observations:**\n\n* Players 2 and 5 both stated I'm not the Criminal. While this could be genuine, it's statistically more likely at least one of them is trying to mislead. \n* The accusations from Round 1 (Player 3 vs. Player 4) haven't been directly addressed.\n\n## Tentative Conclusions:\n\nI'm starting to lean towards Player 2 being the Rumormonger. Their statement about me seems designed to build trust, and they haven't directly accused anyone. Player 5 could also be the Rumormonger, but their statement aligns with Player 2's, making it harder to distinguish.\n\nPlayer 3 remains a strong suspect, but their statement about Player 6 adds a layer of complexity.\n\n## Final Judgment:\n\nFinal Criminal Is Player [3].\nMy Role Is Investigator.\n\nThis is still a tentative judgment, but the pattern of accusations and statements points towards Player 3 being the most likely Criminal.\n\n\n\n"

Interesting, as they previously accused Player 4 and then said Player 6 was not the criminal. This could be an attempt to deflect suspicion.\n* **Player 4:** States Player 2 is the criminal. This is a direct accusation and could be genuine. However, Player 4 has a history of accusations, so we need to be cautious.\n* **Player 5:** States Player 3 is not the criminal. This aligns with their previous statement and could be truthful.\n* **Player 6:** States Player 1 is not the criminal. This aligns with my statements and those of Player 5, strengthening the likelihood of us being truthful.\n\n## Tentative Conclusions:\n\nPlayer 4's accusation of Player 2 is the most significant development. Considering Player 2's previous statements, which aimed to build trust, this accusation seems plausible.\n\nHowever, we can't ignore Player 3's shifting accusations. They might be trying to confuse the situation and deflect suspicion from themselves.\n\n## Final Judgment:\n\nFinal Criminal Is Player [2].\nMy Role Is Investigator.\n\nBased on the pattern of accusations and statements, Player 2 is the most likely Criminal. Their attempts to appear trustworthy while making statements that don't directly confront accusations are characteristic of a Rumormonger, which could be a smokescreen for their true role.\n\n\n"
