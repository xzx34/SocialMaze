However, the presence of a Lunatic and the potential for false accusations makes it difficult to conclude my role with certainty based solely on Round 1 statements.\n- The statements about Player 5 being or not being the Criminal are conflicting, which suggests that at least one of the players making these statements is not an Investigator.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nGiven the information and my role being told as the Criminal, but considering the game dynamics and potential for deception:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

However, the dynamics of the game, especially with potential Lunatics and the Criminal's ability to lie, mean that direct accusations are not always reliable.\n- The consistent denial of Player 5 being the Criminal by multiple players (Player 2, Player 3, and Player 6) could indicate that Player 5 is indeed not the Criminal, assuming these players are telling the truth or believing they are telling the truth (in the case of Rumormongers).\n\n**Conclusion**:\nGiven the evolving information and considering the potential roles and strategies of players:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal.\n\nThis conclusion is based on the initial information provided to me and the dynamics of the game, where direct accusations and defenses are common.

If Player 4 is an Investigator, they would not make this statement. This indicates that Player 4 might be the Lunatic, believing they are the Criminal and making false accusations.\n\n5. **Player 5 says Player 2 is not the criminal.** Given that I am the Criminal, and considering the previous statements, Player 5's denial of Player 2's criminal role could be an attempt to mislead or a genuine statement from a Rumormonger or an Investigator.\n\n6. **Player 6 says Player 2 is not the criminal.** Similar to Player 5's statement, this could be true or an attempt to mislead, depending on Player 6's role.\n\nConsidering all rounds, the key information is that I am the Criminal, and other players' statements can be analyzed based on this fact. Players 2, 5, and 6 have made statements that could be seen as attempts to mislead or genuine beliefs based on their roles. Player 4's accusation of Player 2 in Round 3, given that I know I am the Criminal, suggests that Player 4 might be the Lunatic, making false accusations.\n\n**Final Judgment:**\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

Player 6's statement agreeing with me (that Player 2 is the Criminal) could be true if Player 6 is an Investigator or coincidentally correct if Player 6 is the Lunatic.\n- Player 3 confirming I am not the Criminal supports my role as an Investigator but doesn't provide direct insight into who the Criminal is.\n- Players 4 and 5's statements about each other and Player 6 not being the Criminal could be attempts to mislead if either is the Criminal or Lunatic, or they could be truthful if they are Investigators.\n\nGiven the information from Round 1, the most direct evidence points towards **Player 2** being the Criminal, based on my statement and Player 6's statement. However, it's crucial to remember that this is just the first round, and more information will be needed to confirm roles and the identity of the Criminal.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 2.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

If Player 2 is indeed the Criminal (as suspected from Round 1), this statement could be an attempt to deflect suspicion from themselves or mislead about Player 4's role.\n- **Player 3** says Player 4 is not the criminal.

Therefore, if Player 4's statement is true, it would imply I am not an Investigator, which contradicts the initial information. Thus, Player 4's statement about Player 5 being the criminal is likely false, suggesting Player 4 might not be an Investigator or is the Lunatic.\n- **Player 5** says Player 1 is not the criminal. This statement supports my known role as an Investigator but does not provide direct insight into who the Criminal is.\n- **Player 6** says Player 3 is not the criminal. This statement, combined with previous statements, suggests Player 6 could be an Investigator or possibly the Lunatic providing a truthful statement by coincidence.\n\nFrom Round 1, we suspected **Player 2** might be the Criminal based on the statements.

As an Investigator, I know my statement about Player 5 is true. Thus, Player 4's statement is likely false, which could indicate Player 4 is either the Lunatic (believing they are the Criminal and making false statements) or possibly the Criminal themselves trying to mislead. But given the initial setup and the direct contradiction, it's more plausible that Player 4 is the Lunatic, as the Criminal would more likely try to deflect suspicion directly from themselves rather than making a statement that could so directly contradict an Investigator's truthful claim.\n\nConsidering all statements, **Player 2** remains a suspect for being the Criminal due to the initial suspicion and the potential for misleading statements in Round 2. **Player 4**'s false statement about Player 5 suggests they might be the Lunatic.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 2.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

My role as an Investigator is confirmed by the game setup.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player Unknown.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

The consistent accusations against Player 6 make them a prime candidate for the Criminal role, but this conclusion is based on the information provided and the deductions made from the statements.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 6.\nMy Role Is Lunatic."

Since I am not the criminal and **Player 3** says I am, **Player 3** is likely the Criminal or the Lunatic.

As a Criminal, I might try to mislead or I might tell the truth to blend in.\n\n2. **Player 2 says Player 1 is the criminal.** \n   - If Player 2 is an Investigator, then their statement would be true, and I (Player 1) would indeed be the Criminal, which aligns with what I've been told.

If Player 3 is an Investigator, then Player 2 is not the Criminal. If Player 3 is the Lunatic or the Criminal (which is me, according to my information), this statement could be an attempt to mislead.\n\n4. **Player 4 says Player 5 is not the criminal.** \n   - Similar to the other statements, without knowing Player 4's role, it's hard to determine the truthfulness of this statement.\n\n5. **Player 5 says Player 2 is not the criminal.** \n   - Again, the truthfulness depends on Player 5's role.\n\n6. **Player 6 says Player 3 is not the criminal.** \n   - This statement's truthfulness also depends on Player 6's role.\n\nGiven the information from Round 1 and the fact that I've been told I am the Criminal, let's analyze the key points:\n\n- **Player 2's statement** directly accuses me of being the Criminal, which aligns with my given role. If Player 2 is indeed an Investigator, this would be a strong indication that I am indeed the Criminal, as Investigators always tell the truth.\n\n- The statements from other players about each other not being the Criminal could be attempts to mislead or genuine truths, depending on their roles.\n\nAt this stage, based on the direct accusation by Player 2 and considering my given role, the most straightforward conclusion to draw, without overcomplicating the analysis with speculation about other roles, is:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

This creates a complex web where, without direct evidence of deception or truth-telling patterns that clearly identify the Criminal or Lunatic, it's challenging to make a definitive judgment.\n\nGiven the information, the most consistent and trustworthy source is myself as an Investigator. Other players' statements either align with mine or create confusion, making it hard to pinpoint the Criminal with absolute certainty after just two rounds.\n\nHowever, considering the aim is to provide a judgment based on the analysis:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 3.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

If Player 6 is an Investigator, then Player 2 is not the Criminal.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- Players 3 and 4 both accuse Player 5 of being the Criminal. If both were Investigators, this would strongly suggest Player 5 is indeed the Criminal. However, given that I am told I am the Criminal, and considering the roles and possible lies, it's essential to consider that at least one of these players might not be an Investigator.\n- Player 5's statement that I am not the Criminal is interesting because, as the player told I am the Criminal, I should consider if Player 5's statement could be a strategic move or based on their actual role.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nGiven that I am told I am the Criminal, and analyzing the statements provided, it seems there's an attempt to mislead or reveal information based on the roles. However, without more information about the other players' roles and considering the potential for false statements from non-Investigator roles, making an accurate judgment about who the Criminal is and my own role (beyond what I've been told) is challenging.\n\n**Final Judgment:**\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

Since I have been told I am the Criminal, and assuming Player 4 is an Investigator (which would make their statement truthful), this aligns with the information provided to me.\n\nHowever, it's crucial to note that with the roles of other players still uncertain and only one round of statements analyzed, making definitive conclusions about all roles might be premature. Yet, based on the direct accusation and my prior knowledge, a preliminary judgment can be made.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

However, the absence of any contradictory statements makes it difficult to pinpoint the Criminal or other roles based solely on Round 1.\n\nSince I am told I am an Investigator and my statement about Player 3 not being the criminal is truthful, and given the lack of direct evidence pointing to any specific player as the Criminal from this round, I must rely on the process of elimination and the behavior of players in subsequent rounds to make more accurate judgments.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player Unknown.\nMy Role Is Investigator."
