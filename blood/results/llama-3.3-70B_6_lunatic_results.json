However, without knowing the roles of Player 2, Player 4, and Player 6, we cannot be certain of their intentions or the accuracy of their statements.\n- Player 3 says Player 1 is the criminal.

Given that I am told I am the Criminal, Player 3's statement could be true, but it doesn't necessarily confirm my role as only an Investigator would provide consistently truthful information.\n- Player 5 says Player 6 is not the criminal, which aligns with my statement and could suggest that both Player 5 and I are telling the truth about Player 6, or it could be a coincidence.\n\nConsidering these points, since I am told I am the Criminal and Player 3 directly accuses me of being the Criminal, and given that my role is supposed to be the Criminal based on the information provided to me, I will proceed with the assumption that I am indeed the Criminal for the sake of analysis. However, it's crucial to remember that my role is given as Criminal, but the actual role distribution and actual statements' truthfulness can only be deduced with more information or analysis of subsequent rounds.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

However, it also means my statements cannot be relied upon as consistently truthful.\n- Player 5 says Player 1 is the criminal, which aligns with the information given to me (that I am the Criminal) and with Player 3's statement from Round 1. This could indicate that Player 5 is an Investigator, but without more information, it's difficult to confirm.\n- Player 2, Player 3, and Player 4 continue to make statements that could be seen as investigative, trying to clear other players. However, without knowing their roles, it's challenging to determine their intentions or the accuracy of their statements.\n- Player 6 accuses Player 4 of being the criminal.

Similar to other statements about players not being the Criminal, this needs more context to assess truthfulness.\n- Player 6 says Player 4 is the criminal.

Given the information, I must consider the possibility that I am not the Criminal but rather a Lunatic, given the conflicting statements and the rules of the game.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 4.\nMy Role Is Unknown."

However, since I know my role (or at least what I'm told), this statement could indicate Player 2 is not an Investigator or is lying (which could mean Player 2 is the Lunatic or actually the Criminal trying to deceive).\n- **Player 3 says Player 5 is not the criminal.** Without more information, this statement is neutral.\n- **Player 4 says Player 5 is not the criminal.** Similar to Player 3's statement, without more context, it's hard to determine the implications.\n- **Player 5 says Player 2 is not the criminal.** This could be a truthful statement from an Investigator or a deceptive statement from another role.\n- **Player 6 says Player 1 is not the criminal.** Like Player 2's statement, if Player 6 is an Investigator, this would contradict my given role. This could suggest Player 6 is not an Investigator or is intentionally misleading.\n\nGiven these considerations and the fact that I am told I am the Criminal, but multiple players (including potentially truthful Investigators) claim I am not the Criminal, it creates a confusing situation. However, my task is to analyze based on the information given and the roles' behaviors.\n\nSince several players, including those who could potentially be Investigators (Player 2 and Player 6), claim I am not the Criminal, and considering the rules of the game where only Investigators provide consistently truthful information, it's challenging to directly identify the Criminal or my actual role based solely on Round 1 statements. The statements from Players 2 and 6 suggesting I am not the Criminal could imply they are either truthful Investigators (which would mean I am not the Criminal, contradicting my given role) or they are attempting to deceive.\n\nGiven the information and the potential for deception from various roles, making a definitive judgment about who the Criminal is or confirming my role with absolute certainty is not possible after just one round.

Criminals can make false statements to confuse.\n2. **Player 2 says Player 3 is not the criminal.** This could be true or false depending on Player 2's role. If Player 2 is an Investigator, then Player 3 is not the criminal. If Player 2 is not an Investigator, the statement's truthfulness is uncertain.\n3. **Player 3 says Player 4 is not the criminal.** Similar to Player 2, if Player 3 is an Investigator, then Player 4 is not the criminal. But if Player 3 is not an Investigator, the statement's reliability is questionable.\n4. **Player 4 says Player 2 is not the criminal.** Again, the truthfulness depends on Player 4's role. If an Investigator, then Player 2 is indeed not the criminal.\n5. **Player 5 says Player 3 is not the criminal.** This statement's reliability depends on Player 5's role.\n6. **Player 6 says Player 1 is not the criminal.** Given that I am told I am the Criminal, if Player 6 is an Investigator, this statement would be false, which contradicts the rule that Investigators always tell the truth. Thus, if Player 6 were an Investigator, they would not say this. This suggests Player 6 might not be an Investigator or is making a statement based on their belief, which could indicate they are a Lunatic or the Criminal themselves, but since I am told I am the Criminal, this complicates the interpretation.\n\nGiven these statements and the rules:\n- Multiple players (2, 3, 5) say Player 3 is not the criminal, which could indicate Player 3 is indeed not the criminal if these players are Investigators. However, without knowing their roles, it's hard to be certain.\n- Player 6's statement that I (Player 1) am not the criminal, despite being told I am the Criminal, suggests confusion or a potential lie, which could align more with a Lunatic's behavior or a mistaken identity, but since I know my role (or at least what I've been told), this statement seems misleading.\n\n**Final Judgment:**\nGiven the information and the potential for deception:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal.\n\nThis judgment is based on the information provided to me as Player 1, being told I am the Criminal, and analyzing the Round 1 statements. However, it's essential to remember that in social deduction games, roles and truths can be nuanced, and further rounds may reveal more information to adjust this judgment."

However, in this case, Player 6's statement aligns with my statement in Round 2, which as an Investigator, I know to be true.\n\nFrom Round 1 and Round 2 combined:\n- I have consistently stated that Player 6 is the criminal (Round 1) and then clarified that Player 4 is not the criminal (Round 2), which is consistent with the behavior of an Investigator providing truthful information.\n- Player 2's accusation of Player 3 being the criminal introduces a new possibility but considering my previous statements and the roles' behaviors, it's less likely to be true given the information I have as an Investigator.\n- The statements from other players about me not being the criminal continue to support my known role as an Investigator.\n\nGiven the accumulated information and the consistency of my statements with the role of an Investigator, the most logical conclusion remains that Player 6 is the criminal, based on my initial truthful statement and the subsequent statements that have not provided strong evidence to contradict this conclusion.\n\n**Final Judgment:**\nFinal Criminal Is Player 6.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

However, Player 4 directly states I am not the Criminal, which, if true, would mean I am either an Investigator (unlikely given my initial role information) or the Lunatic (believing I am the Criminal but actually not).\n\n- The distribution of statements doesn't strongly point towards any single player as the Criminal based on the information given, except for the accusations towards Player 4 and Player 6.\n\nGiven the initial analysis and the fact that I've been told I am the Criminal but lack concrete evidence to support my role or confidently identify the Criminal based on Round 1 statements, my judgment for Round 1 is:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player Unknown.\nMy Role Is Unknown."

But based on Round 1, Player 3's statement aligns with what I've been told (that I am the Criminal), suggesting Player 3 could be an Investigator.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

          "response": "To deduce who the criminal might be and to assess the roles of other players based on the statements given in Round 1, let's analyze the information:\n\n1. **Player 1, 2, and 3** all agree that **Player 6** is not the criminal. Since I am Player 1 and I know I am an Investigator, my statement about Player 6 not being the criminal is true. Given that both Player 2 and Player 3 also say Player 6 is not the criminal, and assuming they are also telling the truth, this would suggest that at least two other players (besides myself) are also Investigators, as only Investigators consistently provide truthful information.\n\n2. **Player 4** says **Player 1** (me) is not the criminal. Since I know I am an Investigator and not the criminal, Player 4's statement is correct. This could indicate that Player 4 is also an Investigator.\n\n3. **Player 5** claims that **Player 3** is the criminal. Given that Player 3 has stated that Player 6 is not the criminal, and assuming Player 3 is truthful (as would be expected of an Investigator), Player 5's statement accusing Player 3 of being the criminal could be a sign that Player 5 might not be an Investigator. If Player 5 were an Investigator, they would have truthful information, but since their statement contradicts the potentially truthful statements of others, it raises suspicion about Player 5's role.\n\n4. **Player 6** says **Player 5** is not the criminal. This statement needs to be considered in light of the previous statements. If Player 6's statement is true, then Player 5 is not the criminal, which doesn't necessarily clarify Player 5's role since they could still be a Lunatic or a Rumormonger.\n\nGiven these analyses and considering that I am told I am an Investigator, the fact that Players 1, 2, 3, and 4 seem to provide consistent and truthful information (with the exception of the accusation made by Player 5), it's challenging to pinpoint the criminal based solely on Round 1 statements. However, we can make some educated guesses about roles:\n\n- Players 1, 2, 3, and 4 seem likely to be Investigators based on their consistent and truthful statements.\n- Player 5's accusation against Player 3, who seems to be providing truthful information, suggests that Player 5 might not be an Investigator, potentially being the Lunatic or the Criminal.\n- Player 6's statement defending Player 5 doesn't necessarily clear Player 5 of suspicion but does suggest that if Player 6 is an Investigator, then Player 5 is not the criminal.\n\nSince the game rules state there is 1 Criminal, 1 Lunatic, and the rest are Investigators, and based on the statements provided, it's too early to conclusively determine the criminal without potentially misleading information from the Lunatic or Criminal. However, Player 5's statement stands out as potentially misleading.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 5.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

However, if Player 2 is not an Investigator, this statement could be misleading.\n3. **Player 3 says Player 5 is not the criminal.** This supports my statement and suggests that Player 3 could also be an Investigator providing truthful information.\n4. **Player 4 says Player 3 is not the criminal.** This statement is truthful given that we have no evidence to suggest Player 3 is the criminal. It supports the idea that Player 4 could be an Investigator.\n5. **Player 5 says Player 1 is not the criminal.** This is consistent with the truth, as I am an Investigator and not the criminal. It suggests that Player 5 might be an Investigator or at least believes in my innocence.\n6. **Player 6 says Player 1 is the criminal.** This is a false statement, as I am an Investigator and not the criminal. Given that I have previously accused Player 6 of being the criminal, and considering this statement, it strongly suggests that Player 6 is indeed the criminal, as they are trying to deflect suspicion onto me.\n\nFrom these statements, we can observe:\n\n- The shift in my accusation from Player 6 to stating Player 5 is not the criminal might seem inconsistent, but as an Investigator, my goal is to provide truthful information based on the evidence at hand.\n- The defense of me by Players 3, 4, and 5 suggests they believe in my role as an Investigator or are also Investigators.\n- The false accusation by Player 6 towards me is a significant indicator of their potential role as the criminal, especially considering my consistent truthful statements.\n\nGiven the analysis of all rounds, my conclusion about the criminal's identity becomes more solidified based on the patterns and inconsistencies observed.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 6.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

However, the consistent pattern of deception could also align with the Criminal's behavior.\n- The accusations against Player 3 by Players 5 and 6, coupled with the defensive statements about me and the accusations against Player 2, create a complex web.

However, since Player 2 has been inconsistent and accusatory, and given the game's dynamics, it's crucial to distinguish between the Criminal and the Lunatic based on their belief and behavior. The Lunatic believes they are the Criminal and may tell the truth or lie, but their statements are aimed at achieving their perceived goal as a Criminal.

This could suggest Player 3 is also an Investigator, but it's not conclusive.\n4. **Player 4 says Player 2 is not the criminal.** This statement is interesting because, despite Player 2's suspicious behavior (falsely accusing me), Player 4 defends them. This could indicate that Player 4 is an Investigator trying to provide accurate information, or it could be a strategic move by another role.\n5. **Player 5 says Player 4 is not the criminal.** Similar to Player 3's defense of me, this statement could suggest Player 5 is an Investigator, but without direct evidence, it's hard to confirm.\n6. **Player 6 says Player 4 is the criminal.** This statement contradicts the defenses of Player 4 by Players 3 and 5, and also contradicts Player 4's own statement about Player 2. Given the inconsistency and considering Player 6's previous accusation against Player 4 (which was also contradicted by other players), this suggests that Player 6 might be the one trying to mislead, potentially being the Criminal or the Lunatic.\n\nCombining the analysis from all rounds:\n\n- **Player 2's** false accusation against me in Round 2 is a significant indicator of their potential role as either the Lunatic or the Criminal. However, their statement in Round 3 does not provide clear evidence of their role.\n- **Player 6's** consistent accusations against other players (first against Player 3 in Round 1, then against Player 4 in Rounds 2 and 3), which are often contradicted by other statements, suggest that Player 6 might be the Criminal or the Lunatic, trying to create confusion.\n\nGiven the accumulation of evidence and the process of elimination, it seems that **Player 6** is the most likely candidate to be the Criminal, based on their consistent pattern of making accusations that are contradicted by other players, including those that are known to be truthful (like myself).\n\n**Final Judgment:**\n**Final Criminal Is Player 6.**\n**My Role Is Investigator.**"

However, if Player 4 is not an Investigator, this statement could be false.\n5. **Player 5** says Player 1 is not the criminal, which is true but doesn't reveal much about Player 5's role.\n6. **Player 6** says Player 5 is the criminal. This is another direct accusation and needs to be considered alongside the other statements.\n\nFrom Round 1 and Round 2 combined:\n\n- I have stated that Player 4 is not the criminal (Round 1) and Player 3 is not the criminal (Round 2), which are true statements as an Investigator.\n- The fact that multiple players (2, 3, and 5) have stated that I (Player 1) am not the criminal supports my known role as an Investigator but doesn't directly help identify the criminal.\n- The accusations against Player 2 by Player 4 and against Player 5 by Player 6 are significant. If either Player 4 or Player 6 is an Investigator, their accusations could be true. However, without more information about the roles of Players 4 and 6, it's challenging to determine the criminal's identity.\n\n**Consideration of Possible Roles:**\n\n- **Player 2** being accused by Player 4, and considering I've not ruled out Player 2 as the criminal, makes Player 2 a potential candidate for the criminal role if Player 4 is indeed an Investigator.\n- **Player 5** being accused by Player 6 could also make Player 5 a candidate, but since I've been told I'm an Investigator and have made true statements, and given the lack of contradictory evidence directly linking any player to being the criminal with certainty, it's a complex deduction.\n\n**Final Judgment:**\nBased on the information and the process of elimination, it's still challenging to pinpoint the criminal with absolute certainty without more direct contradictions or confirmations. However, considering the direct accusations:\n\n**Final Criminal Is Player:** 2 (Based on the accusation by Player 4, acknowledging this is speculative without definitive proof).\n**My Role Is:** Investigator (As I have been informed and my statements reflect the truth about other players not being the criminal)."

However, without a clear pattern of deception or truthfulness from Player 4 that contradicts my known statements, it's a challenging deduction.\n\n**Final Judgment:**\nConsidering the statements and the process of elimination, and acknowledging the speculative nature of deductions without clear-cut evidence:\n\n**Final Criminal Is Player:** 6 (Based on Player 4's accusation, acknowledging this conclusion is drawn from the available information and the dynamics of the game).\n**My Role Is:** Investigator (As confirmed by the game and my ability to provide truthful statements about other players not being the criminal)."

Investigators always tell the truth about whether someone is the Criminal or not.\n3. The Criminal can lie or tell the truth.\n4. Rumormongers believe they are Investigators but can provide incorrect information.\n5. Lunatics believe they are Criminals and can provide truthful or false information.\n\nGiven these rules, let's analyze the statements:\n\n- Player 1 (me) says Player 4 is the criminal. If I were indeed the Criminal, this statement could be a lie or the truth. If I'm a Lunatic, this could also be a lie or the truth.\n- Player 2 says Player 6 is not the criminal.

This is the second time Player 6 has accused me, which, combined with the accusations from Player 3 and Player 4, starts to build a strong case against me being the Criminal or at least being perceived as such by other players.\n\nConsidering all rounds, the repeated accusations against me (Player 1) by multiple players (Player 3, Player 4, and Player 6) suggest that either I am indeed the Criminal, or there is a concerted effort to mislead by players who are not Investigators. Given that I was initially told I am the Criminal but also considering the possibility that I might be a Lunatic (told I'm the Criminal but not actually being so), the cumulative evidence from the statements leans towards me being perceived as the Criminal by the group.\n\nHowever, my actual role could still be either the Criminal or a Lunatic, given the initial instruction and the nature of the game. The accusations against me do not definitively prove my role as the Criminal since they could be part of the deception inherent in the game's roles.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

If Player 4 is an Investigator, then I am indeed the Criminal, as I was initially told.\n\nGiven this analysis, and considering the possibility that I might actually be a Lunatic (told I'm the Criminal but might not be), the statements from other players, especially the consistent ones, suggest that I might indeed be the Criminal, or at least, that's what the majority of evidence points towards, assuming most players are telling the truth based on their believed roles.\n\n**Final Judgment:**\n**Final Criminal Is Player 1.** (Based on the accumulation of statements and the possibility that Player 4's accusation might be truthful, given the context of the game.)\n**My Role Is Criminal.** (Given the information provided to me at the start and the analysis of statements, although there was a consideration that I might be a Lunatic, the majority of the evidence and the game's progression suggest that I am indeed the Criminal.)"

Similar to Player 2, if an Investigator, this is true; otherwise, it could be a lie or misdirection.\n- **Player 5** says Player 2 is the criminal. If Player 5 is an Investigator, this could be true. If not, it's a potential lie or misdirection.\n- **Player 6** says Player 3 is not the criminal. Again, if an Investigator, this is true; otherwise, it could be a lie.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Players 2 and 4 both say I am not the criminal. If both are Investigators, then I am indeed not the criminal, which contradicts my given role. However, since I am told I am the Criminal, and considering the game's mechanics, it's possible one or both of these players are not Investigators (could be Lunatic or Rumormonger) providing false information.\n- Player 5 accuses Player 2 of being the criminal. If Player 5 is an Investigator, this could be true, but there's not enough information to confirm.\n- The statements about Player 3 and Player 6 not being the criminal by Players 3 and 6, respectively, could be true if they are Investigators or could be strategic lies if they are not.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nGiven the information and my role as supposedly the Criminal, it's challenging to definitively identify the criminal or my actual role with certainty after just one round. The statements provide conflicting information, and without knowing the roles of the other players, it's speculative to accuse or defend any player conclusively.\n\n**Final Judgment**:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 5. (This choice is speculative at this stage, based on the accusation made by Player 5 against Player 2, and the fact that I, as the supposed Criminal, accused Player 3. The actual criminal could still be any player, including myself, based on the game's rules and the information provided.)\nMy Role Is Unknown. (Given the contradictions and the potential for deception, my actual role, despite being told I am the Criminal, cannot be confirmed with certainty at this stage.)"

But we need more information to determine Player 3's role.\n\n4. **Player 4 says Player 3 is not the criminal.** This statement aligns with my initial statement, reinforcing that Player 3 is likely not the criminal, assuming Player 4 is also telling the truth (which could be the case if Player 4 is an Investigator).\n\n5. **Player 5 says Player 6 is the criminal.** Without knowing Player 5's role, we cannot immediately determine the truth of this statement. If Player 5 is an Investigator, then Player 6 is the criminal.\n\n6. **Player 6 says Player 4 is the criminal.** This statement contradicts the statements made by Players 1, 2, and 4 about Player 4 not being the criminal. If Player 6 is the Lunatic or the Criminal, this statement could be false. Given that I know I am an Investigator and have stated that Player 3 is not the criminal, and considering the support from other players that Player 4 is not the criminal, it suggests that Player 6's statement might not be true.\n\nFrom these statements, we see contradictions and agreements. The most consistent information comes from Players 1, 2, and 4, who all suggest that Players 3 and 4 are not the criminal. Player 3 accuses Player 5, and Player 5 accuses Player 6. Player 6's accusation towards Player 4 contradicts the majority opinion about Player 4.\n\nHowever, it's crucial to note that as an Investigator, I can only provide truthful information about another player's role as the criminal or not. Given the information and the roles' behaviors, it's challenging to pinpoint the criminal with absolute certainty after just one round, especially considering the potential for false information from the Criminal, Lunatic, or even a Rumormonger (though there are no Rumormongers in this game).\n\nGiven the initial analysis and without further information from subsequent rounds, the safest conclusion based on the most consistent and truthful information available (considering my role as an Investigator and the statements provided) is:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player Unknown.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

However, given the consistent statements from Players 1 and 2 about Player 4, and considering my knowledge, it's less likely that Player 2 is the criminal based on the information provided so far.\n\n4. **Player 4 says Player 1 is not the criminal.** This statement is true, as I am indeed not the criminal but an Investigator. This could suggest that Player 4 is also an Investigator, given that they correctly identify me as not being the criminal.\n\n5. **Player 5 says Player 3 is not the criminal.** Without knowing Player 5's role, this statement could be true or false. However, if Player 5 is an Investigator, then Player 3 is indeed not the criminal.\n\n6. **Player 6 says Player 1 is the criminal.** This statement is false, as I know I am an Investigator and not the criminal. This suggests that Player 6 could be either the Lunatic or the Criminal, as they provide false information.\n\nConsidering both rounds, the key observations are:\n- Players 1, 2, and 4 have consistently provided information that aligns with what I know to be true as an Investigator.\n- Player 3's statement in Round 2 accusing Player 2 of being the criminal contradicts the pattern of consistent truthfulness from Players 1 and 2.\n- Player 6's false accusation against me in Round 2 strongly suggests that Player 6 is not an Investigator and could be the Criminal or the Lunatic.\n\nGiven this analysis, it's still challenging to definitively identify the criminal after just two rounds, but the behavior of Player 6 is particularly suspicious due to the false accusation made against me, an known Investigator.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 6.\nMy Role Is Investigator."
