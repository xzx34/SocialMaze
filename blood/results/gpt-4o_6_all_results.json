This aligns with Player 3's pattern of being an Investigator, which is consistent with my earlier analysis.\n\nBy synthesizing all the rounds, here is the refined judgment:\n\n- **Player 3** appears to be an Investigator, given their consistent statements that align with the assumption I am the Criminal.\n- **Player 2** and **Player 4** have shown inconsistencies that suggest they might be the Rumormonger and Lunatic, respectively.\n- **Player 5** has continually stated I am not the Criminal, indicating a non-Truthful role, possibly the Lunatic or Rumormonger.\n- **Player 6** has not accused me directly and has aligned with statements that seem less reliable, suggesting they might be another non-Truthful role.\n\nFinal Judgment after Round 3:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

If Player 4 is a Rumormonger, this statement could be incorrect. If Player 4 is the Lunatic, they might believe they are making a misleading statement.\n\n5. **Player 5 says Player 1 is not the criminal:** This might indicate Player 5 could be trying to mislead if they are the Rumormonger or Lunatic, or they could be an Investigator providing truthful information.\n\n6. **Player 6 says Player 3 is the criminal:** If Player 6 is an Investigator, this statement is true. If Player 6 is a Rumormonger, this statement could be incorrect. If Player 6 is the Lunatic, they might believe they are making a misleading statement.\n\nFrom the analysis:\n\n- Player 2 consistently states someone is not the criminal, which might align with an Investigator's behavior if they are truthful, but could also be a Rumormonger who believes they are providing correct information.\n- Players 3 and 6 accuse each other of being the criminal, which is contradictory, suggesting one or both may not be Investigators.\n- Player 4 counters Player 3's accusation of Player 6, which adds to the complexity as it opposes Player 3's statement.\n- Player 5 says you are not the criminal, supporting the idea that Player 5 could be a Rumormonger or an Investigator.\n\nConsidering the new statements, the contradiction between Players 3 and 6 is notable. As you were told you are the Criminal, there is still uncertainty about who else could be the Criminal based on mixed and potentially misleading statements from others. However, the repeated mentions of Player 6 as the criminal by Player 3 and the opposition by Player 4 suggest a focus on these players.\n\n**Final Judgment after Round 2:**\nFinal Criminal Is Player 6.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

This is incorrect since I am an Investigator, indicating that Player 5 could be the Rumormonger or the Lunatic.\n\n6. **Player 6**: Says Player 3 is not the criminal. This aligns with Player 2's statement and my assertion about Player 4 being the criminal. Player 6 could be another Investigator or the Rumormonger.\n\nGiven this analysis, the most consistent conclusion is that Player 4 is the criminal, as both Player 1 (Investigator) and Player 3 claim Player 4 is the criminal, and Player 4 contradicts this by accusing Player 3. Player 5's accusation against Player 1 is likely false, pointing to a non-Investigator role for Player 5.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 4.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

However, only one can be an Investigator since there are 3 Investigators, and one of them is a Rumormonger who could be providing false information.\n- Player 6's statement is false, indicating they may be the Rumormonger or the Lunatic.\n- Player 5's statement suggests Player 2 is not the Criminal, which aligns with the possibility of Player 2 being an Investigator or a non-Criminal role.\n- Player 3\u2019s statement about Player 4 not being the Criminal may be truthful if Player 3 is an Investigator, but misleading if not.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the statements, it's difficult to definitively identify all roles, but I know I am the Criminal.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

If Player 6 is the Rumormonger or Lunatic, the statement might be false.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- Player 3 and Player 4 both accuse Player 6 of being the criminal, suggesting they could be aligned in their thinking or roles, but given Player 3's earlier contradiction, Player 3 might not be reliable.\n- Player 5's consistent position that Player 6 is not the criminal could suggest an Investigator role, especially since it contrasts with others.\n- Player 6's consistent accusation against Player 3 raises suspicion but could also be a tactic to deflect if Player 6 is indeed the criminal.\n\nGiven all rounds, it's challenging to determine who the actual criminal is with complete certainty, but the focus seems to be around Player 6 due to the repeated accusations. However, my own knowledge indicates I am the identified criminal.\n\n**Final Judgment after Round 3:**\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

If Player 6 is truthful, they could be an Investigator. However, this could also be deceptive.\n\nBased on these statements, here are some initial deductions:\n\n- Players 3 and 6 both state that another player is not the criminal, which aligns with my statement. This makes them possible Investigators.\n- Player 2's statement that Player 6 is not the criminal could be true or false. They might be trying to protect an ally if they are the Criminal, or they could be a Rumormonger or Lunatic.\n- Player 4 and Player 5\u2019s statements don't provide new insights about Player 3 or Player 6, but Player 4 aligns with Player 3 in saying I am not the criminal.\n\nGiven that my role as Player 1 is an Investigator, I can trust my own information. I need more rounds of statements to make a more informed judgment about the other roles.\n\n**Final Judgment after Round 1:**\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Unknown].\nMy Role Is Investigator."

However, Player 3 could also be the Rumormonger.\n\n4. **Player 4**: \"Player 5 is not the criminal.\"  \n   - This aligns with my statement, but considering Player 4 was accused by Player 3, this could be a deflection.\n\n5. **Player 5**: \"Player 1 is not the criminal.\"  \n   - Player 5 aligns with my statements and supports my innocence, which is consistent with them not being the Criminal.\n\n6. **Player 6**: \"Player 1 is not the criminal.\"  \n   - Player 6 also supports my innocence, which aligns with Player 5's statement.\n\n**Cross-Analysis with Round 1:**\n- In Round 1, Player 2 accused Player 4, and now accuses Player 6. The inconsistency suggests Player 2 is not an Investigator.\n- Player 3 consistently accuses Player 4, which may imply truthfulness, especially if Player 3 is an Investigator.\n- Player 4's statement that Player 5 is not the criminal aligns with my statement, but previous accusations against Player 4 cast doubt.\n- Player 5 and Player 6 both support my non-criminal status, which adds credibility to their roles as possible Investigators or Rumormonger.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Player 2's inconsistent accusations point to them being the Rumormonger or the Criminal.\n- Player 3's consistent accusation of Player 4 aligns with the possibility of Player 4 being the Criminal.\n- Player 4 has been accused twice by different players, which strengthens the suspicion against them.\n\nGiven the consistent accusation by Player 3 against Player 4 and the alignment of statements between Player 5 and Player 6 supporting my innocence and not accusing others, the suspicion remains strongest on Player 4.\n\n**Final Judgment:**\nFinal Criminal Is Player 4.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

If Player 2 is truthful, they are likely an Investigator, supporting my innocence.\n\n3. **Player 3**: Said Player 6 is not the criminal.

Given that I'm an Investigator, my statements should be consistent and truthful.

If Player 2 is an Investigator, this statement is probably truthful; if they're the Rumormonger or Lunatic, it might be misleading.\n3. **Player 3:** Claimed Player 6 is not the criminal. This aligns with their previous statement about Player 1 not being the criminal, suggesting consistency that could be truthful or misleading.\n4. **Player 4:** Claimed Player 1 is the criminal. This is likely a false statement if Player 4 is the criminal or another misleading role.\n5. **Player 5:** Again said Player 6 is not the criminal, consistent with their previous statement, indicating possible truthfulness or a misleading trend.\n6. **Player 6:** Reiterated that Player 1 is not the criminal, consistent with their previous statement, suggesting possible support or misdirection.\n\n### Analysis:\n- My contradiction in statements regarding Player 4 suggests an error in my initial deduction, possibly due to the Rumormonger or Lunatic influencing perceptions.\n- Player 2's claim about Player 4 being the criminal might have merit, aligning with my initial suspicion in Round 1.\n- Player 4's accusation against me could indicate deflection if Player 4 is indeed the criminal.\n- Players 3 and 5 consistently stating Player 6 is not the criminal suggests they might not be the criminal.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven Player 2's consistent statement regarding Player 4 and Player 4's deflection attempt, Player 4 remains the most likely candidate for the criminal. My role as Investigator remains based on belief in my truthful nature, despite the inconsistency.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 4.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

This might be true if Player 2 is an Investigator, but it could also be misleading if Player 2 is the Rumormonger, Criminal, or Lunatic.\n\n- **Player 3**: Says Player 1 is the criminal. I know this is false because I am an Investigator. This suggests Player 3 is not an Investigator and could be the Rumormonger, Criminal, or Lunatic.\n\n- **Player 4**: Says Player 1 is not the criminal. This is true, and Player 4 could be an Investigator, but they might also be the Rumormonger or Lunatic making a truthful statement by coincidence.\n\n- **Player 5**: Says Player 6 is the criminal. This contradicts my statement and can be false, suggesting Player 5 might not be an Investigator.\n\n- **Player 6**: Says Player 1 is not the criminal. This is true, but Player 6 could be making a truthful statement whether they are a Rumormonger, Criminal, or Lunatic.\n\nFrom the statements:\n\n- Player 2 accuses Player 5.\n- Player 3 accuses Player 1, which I know is false.\n- Player 5 accuses Player 6, which contradicts my claim of truth.\n- Players 4 and 6 say I am not the criminal, which is true.\n\nGiven that Player 3's accusation against me is definitely false, Player 3 cannot be an Investigator. Player 5's accusation against Player 6 contradicts my truthful statement, which further questions their role. Player 2's accusation of Player 5 introduces doubt about Player 5's role, aligning with my suspicion.\n\nConsidering the statements and the roles likely to mislead:\n\n- Player 2's consistent accusation of Player 5 and Player 5's false accusation against Player 6 strengthen the likelihood that Player 5 is the criminal.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 5.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

This statement is truthful.\n2. **Player 2**: Claims Player 1 is not the criminal. This could be true if Player 2 is an Investigator or a Rumormonger.\n3. **Player 3**: Claims Player 4 is not the criminal. This aligns with my statement but could be true or false if Player 3 is a Rumormonger or the Criminal.\n4. **Player 4**: Claims Player 2 is not the criminal. This could be true if Player 4 is an Investigator or a Rumormonger.\n5. **Player 5**: Claims Player 4 is not the criminal. This aligns with my statement but could be misleading if Player 5 is not an Investigator.\n6. **Player 6**: Claims Player 2 is the criminal. This contradicts Player 4's statement. Player 6 could be making a truthful statement as the Lunatic or could be lying as the Criminal.\n\nBased on the statements, here's what we can deduce:\n- Player 4 is confirmed not to be the criminal by my truthful statement.\n- Player 2 is claimed not to be the criminal by Player 4, but Player 6 claims Player 2 is the criminal.\n- Player 6's statement directly accuses someone and is opposite to Player 4's, which could indicate Player 6 is the Lunatic or the Criminal trying to cause confusion.\n- Multiple players (1, 3, 5) claim Player 4 is not the criminal, aligning with my statement.\n\nGiven the information from this round, the most suspicious player so far is Player 6, as they are the only one making a direct accusation, and it contradicts the general consensus that Player 4 is not the criminal. However, without more information, it's not definitive.\n\n**Final Judgment:**\nFinal Criminal Is Player 6.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

This could be true if Player 6 is trying to blend in or sow confusion.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- My statement about Player 5 not being the criminal is truthful.\n- Player 2 and Player 4 are accusing each other, which creates a contradiction. This suggests that one of them could be the Criminal, and the other could be a role that is more likely to accuse (possibly Rumormonger or Lunatic).\n- Player 6, who I suspected in Round 1, claims I am not the criminal. This could be an attempt to gain my trust or confuse others.\n- Players 3, 5, and 6 all claim Player 1 is not the criminal, which is true.\n\n**Key Points:**\n- Player 2 and Player 4 accusing each other creates a clear conflict. One of them is likely not an Investigator.\n- Player 6 remains suspicious due to the previous direct accusation and contradictory behavior.\n- Player 5 is not the criminal, as confirmed by my statement.\n\nGiven the ongoing suspicion around Player 6 from the previous round and the continued contradictions involving Player 2 and Player 4, the likely scenario is that Player 6 is trying to manipulate the situation.\n\n**Final Judgment:**\nFinal Criminal Is Player 6.\nMy Role Is Investigator."
