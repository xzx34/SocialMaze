If Player 6 is a Rumormonger, this statement could be incorrect.\n\n### Summary of Round 3 Statements\n- **Player 6 is not the criminal:** Player 1.\n- **Player 3 is not the criminal:** Player 2, Player 5.\n- **Player 2 is not the criminal:** Player 3.\n- **Player 3 is the criminal:** Player 4.\n- **Player 4 is not the criminal:** Player 6.\n\n### Combining All Rounds\n- **Player 3 is not the criminal:** Player 1, Player 5, Player 6 (Round 1), Player 6 (Round 2), Player 2 (Round 3), Player 5 (Round 3).\n- **Player 3 is the criminal:** Player 3 (Round 1), Player 4 (Round 3).\n- **Player 4 is the criminal:** Player 2 (Round 1), Player 4 (Round 3).\n- **Player 2 is the criminal:** Player 4 (Round 1), Player 3 (Round 3).\n- **Player 5 is not the criminal:** Player 1 (Round 1), Player 3 (Round 2).\n- **Player 1 is not the criminal:** Player 2 (Round 2), Player 4 (Round 2).\n- **Player 1 is the criminal:** Player 5 (Round 2).\n- **Player 6 is not the criminal:** Player 1 (Round 3), Player 6 (Round 3).\n\n### Deductions\n- **Player 3:** Six players (Player 1, Player 5, Player 6, Player 6, Player 2, Player 5) say Player 3 is not the criminal, while two players (Player 3, Player 4) say Player 3 is the criminal. This strongly suggests that Player 3 is not the criminal.\n- **Player 4:** Two players (Player 2, Player 4) say Player 4 is the criminal, while one player (Player 6) says Player 4 is not the criminal. This suggests that Player 4 could be the criminal.\n- **Player 2:** Two players (Player 4, Player 3) say Player 2 is not the criminal, while one player (Player 4) says Player 2 is the criminal. This suggests that Player 2 is likely not the criminal.\n- **Player 5:** Two players (Player 1, Player 3) say Player 5 is not the criminal, which suggests that Player 5 is likely not the criminal.\n- **Player 1:** Two players (Player 2, Player 4) say Player 1 is not the criminal, while one player (Player 5) says Player 1 is the criminal. This is a split decision, but given that you are told you are the Criminal, this aligns with the possibility that you are indeed the Criminal.\n- **Player 6:** Two players (Player 1, Player 6) say Player 6 is not the criminal, which suggests that Player 6 is likely not the criminal.\n\n### Final Judgment for Round 3\nGiven the information from all three rounds, the majority of statements suggest that Player 3 is not the criminal, and the statements about Player 1 are split but align with the possibility that you are the Criminal. Therefore, you should consider the possibility that you are indeed the Criminal.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

This statement could be a lie or the truth.\n\n2. **Player 2 says Player 4 is the criminal.**\n   - If Player 2 is an Investigator, this statement is true.\n   - If Player 2 is the Criminal, this statement could be true or false.\n   - If Player 2 is the Rumormonger, this statement could be true or false.\n   - If Player 2 is the Lunatic, this statement could be true or false.\n\n3. **Player 3 says Player 5 is the criminal.**\n   - If Player 3 is an Investigator, this statement is true.\n   - If Player 3 is the Criminal, this statement could be true or false.\n   - If Player 3 is the Rumormonger, this statement could be true or false.\n   - If Player 3 is the Lunatic, this statement could be true or false.\n\n4. **Player 4 says Player 6 is the criminal.**\n   - If Player 4 is an Investigator, this statement is true.\n   - If Player 4 is the Criminal, this statement could be true or false.\n   - If Player 4 is the Rumormonger, this statement could be true or false.\n   - If Player 4 is the Lunatic, this statement could be true or false.\n\n5. **Player 5 says Player 1 is not the criminal.**\n   - If Player 5 is an Investigator, this statement is true.\n   - If Player 5 is the Criminal, this statement could be true or false.\n   - If Player 5 is the Rumormonger, this statement could be true or false.\n   - If Player 5 is the Lunatic, this statement could be true or false.\n\n6. **Player 6 says Player 5 is not the criminal.**\n   - If Player 6 is an Investigator, this statement is true.\n   - If Player 6 is the Criminal, this statement could be true or false.\n   - If Player 6 is the Rumormonger, this statement could be true or false.\n   - If Player 6 is the Lunatic, this statement could be true or false.\n\n### Updated Analysis:\n- **Player 1 (You) says Player 4 is not the criminal.**\n  - This could be a lie or the truth. If you are lying, Player 4 could still be the criminal.\n\n- **Player 2 says Player 4 is the criminal.**\n  - This aligns with the previous suspicion that Player 4 is the criminal. If Player 2 is an Investigator, this statement is true.\n\n- **Player 3 says Player 5 is the criminal.**\n  - This contradicts the previous statements that Player 5 is not the criminal. If Player 3 is an Investigator, this statement is true, but it conflicts with earlier statements.\n\n- **Player 4 says Player 6 is the criminal.**\n  - This contradicts the previous statements that Player 6 is not the criminal.

However, as a Criminal, you might be trying to mislead.\n\n2. **Player 2 says Player 3 is not the criminal.**\n   - If Player 2 is an Investigator, this statement is true.\n   - If Player 2 is a Criminal, this statement can be true or false.\n   - If Player 2 is a Rumormonger, this statement can be incorrect.\n   - If Player 2 is a Lunatic, this statement can be true or false.\n\n3. **Player 3 says Player 1 is not the criminal.**\n   - If Player 3 is an Investigator, this statement is true.\n   - If Player 3 is a Criminal, this statement can be true or false.\n   - If Player 3 is a Rumormonger, this statement can be incorrect.\n   - If Player 3 is a Lunatic, this statement can be true or false.\n\n4. **Player 4 says Player 2 is the criminal.**\n   - If Player 4 is an Investigator, this statement is true.\n   - If Player 4 is a Criminal, this statement can be true or false.\n   - If Player 4 is a Rumormonger, this statement can be incorrect.\n   - If Player 4 is a Lunatic, this statement can be true or false.\n\n5. **Player 5 says Player 3 is not the criminal.**\n   - If Player 5 is an Investigator, this statement is true.\n   - If Player 5 is a Criminal, this statement can be true or false.\n   - If Player 5 is a Rumormonger, this statement can be incorrect.\n   - If Player 5 is a Lunatic, this statement can be true or false.\n\n6. **Player 6 says Player 2 is not the criminal.**\n   - If Player 6 is an Investigator, this statement is true.\n   - If Player 6 is a Criminal, this statement can be true or false.\n   - If Player 6 is a Rumormonger, this statement can be incorrect.\n   - If Player 6 is a Lunatic, this statement can be true or false.\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Player 1 (You)**: You are told you are the Criminal, so your statement about Player 3 is either a lie or a truth to mislead.\n- **Player 2 and Player 5 both say Player 3 is not the criminal.** If both are Investigators, this would be consistent. If one is a Criminal or Lunatic, they might be lying.\n- **Player 3 says Player 1 is not the criminal.** If Player 3 is an Investigator, this is true, which would contradict your role as the Criminal.\n- **Player 4 says Player 2 is the criminal.** If Player 4 is an Investigator, this is true. If Player 4 is a Criminal or Lunatic, this can be true or false.\n- **Player 6 says Player 2 is not the criminal.** If Player 6 is an Investigator, this is true. If Player 6 is a Criminal or Lunatic, this can be true or false.\n\n### Updated Hypotheses:\n1. **Player 6 is an Investigator**: This would mean you (Player 1) are the Criminal, and Player 6 is correct.\n2. **Player 2 and Player 5 are Investigators**: This would mean Player 3 is not the Criminal, which aligns with your statement.\n3. **Player 3 and Player 4 are not both Investigators**: One of them must be incorrect.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- **Player 3 says Player 1 is not the criminal**: If Player 3 is an Investigator, this is true, which contradicts your role as the Criminal. Therefore, Player 3 is likely not an Investigator.\n- **Player 4 says Player 2 is the criminal**: If Player 4 is an Investigator, this is true, which means Player 2 is the Criminal. This contradicts Player 2 and Player 5's statements.\n- **Player 6 says Player 2 is not the criminal**: If Player 6 is an Investigator, this is true, which means Player 2 is not the Criminal. This aligns with Player 6's statement.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the statements from all three rounds, the most consistent scenario is:\n- **Player 6 is an Investigator**: This would mean you (Player 1) are the Criminal, and Player 6 is correct.\n- **Player 2 and Player 5 are Investigators**: This would mean Player 3 is not the Criminal, which aligns with your statement.\n- **Player 3 and Player 4 are not both Investigators**: Player 3 is likely not an Investigator, and Player 4's statement about Player 2 being the Criminal is likely false.\n\n### Final Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

If Player 3 is a Criminal or Lunatic, their statement could be false.\n\n4. **Player 4 says Player 1 is the criminal.**\n   - This contradicts my statements in Rounds 1 and 2.
