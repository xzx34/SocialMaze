This aligns with Player 4's statement, suggesting Player 6 could be an Investigator or providing a truthful statement as a Lunatic or Rumormonger.\n\n#### Conclusion:\n- **Player 5 is the criminal** (confirmed by your statements in previous rounds and the lie in this round).\n- **Player 3 is not the criminal** (confirmed by your statement).\n- **Player 2 and Player 6** both claim Player 2 is not the criminal, which aligns with Player 4's statement. This suggests Player 2 is not the criminal and could be an Investigator, Rumormonger, or Lunatic.\n- **Player 4** claims Player 2 is not the criminal, which aligns with Player 2 and Player 6's statements. This suggests Player 4 is not the criminal and could be an Investigator, Rumormonger, or Lunatic.\n- **Player 3** claims Player 4 is not the criminal, which aligns with your statement that Player 4 is not the criminal. This suggests Player 3 is not the criminal and could be an Investigator, Rumormonger, or Lunatic.\n\n### Final Judgment After Round 3:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 5.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

If Player 3 is the Rumormonger, they believe they are an Investigator and might provide incorrect information. If Player 3 is the Lunatic, they believe they are the Criminal and can make any statement.\n\n- **Player 4**: Claims Player 1 is not the criminal. Since I am the Criminal, this statement must be false. This suggests that Player 4 is not an Investigator. Player 4 could be the Criminal, Rumormonger, or Lunatic.\n\n- **Player 5**: Claims Player 2 is not the criminal. If Player 5 is an Investigator, this statement must be true. If Player 5 is the Criminal, this statement could be either true or false. If Player 5 is the Rumormonger, they believe they are an Investigator and might provide incorrect information. If Player 5 is the Lunatic, they believe they are the Criminal and can make any statement.\n\n- **Player 6**: Claims Player 2 is not the criminal. If Player 6 is an Investigator, this statement must be true. If Player 6 is the Criminal, this statement could be either true or false. If Player 6 is the Rumormonger, they believe they are an Investigator and might provide incorrect information. If Player 6 is the Lunatic, they believe they are the Criminal and can make any statement.\n\n#### Consistency Check:\n- **Player 1 (Criminal)**: My statement that Player 2 is the criminal could be true or false. This adds to the confusion but doesn't provide definitive information.\n\n- **Player 2**: Claims Player 3 is not the criminal. Since Player 2 is not the Criminal (as multiple players claim Player 2 is not the criminal), this statement is likely true, suggesting Player 2 is not the Criminal. This means Player 2 could be an Investigator, Rumormonger, or Lunatic.\n\n- **Player 3**: Claims Player 6 is the criminal. This is consistent with previous statements from Player 3, suggesting that Player 3 is either the Criminal or a Rumormonger.\n\n- **Player 4**: Claims Player 1 is not the criminal. Since I am the Criminal, this statement is false, suggesting that Player 4 is not an Investigator. Player 4 could be the Criminal, Rumormonger, or Lunatic.\n\n- **Player 5 and Player 6**: Both claim Player 2 is not the criminal. This is consistent with Player 2's statement that Player 3 is not the criminal, suggesting that Player 2 is not the Criminal. This means Player 5 and Player 6 could be Investigators, Rumormongers, or Lunatics.\n\n#### Tentative Conclusion:\n- **Player 3**: Since Player 3 consistently claims Player 6 is the criminal, and this is consistent with previous statements, Player 3 is a strong candidate for being the Criminal. However, Player 3 could also be a Rumormonger.\n\n- **Player 2**: Since multiple players claim Player 2 is not the criminal, and Player 2 claims Player 3 is not the criminal, Player 2 is likely not the Criminal. Player 2 could be an Investigator, Rumormonger, or Lunatic.\n\n- **Player 4**: Since Player 4 claims Player 1 is not the criminal, and I am the Criminal, Player 4 is not an Investigator. Player 4 could be the Criminal, Rumormonger, or Lunatic.\n\n- **Player 5 and Player 6**: Both claim Player 2 is not the criminal, suggesting they are likely not the Criminal. They could be Investigators, Rumormongers, or Lunatics.\n\n### Final Judgment for Round 3:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 3.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

Player 6 could be an Investigator, Rumormonger, or a Criminal. If Player 6 is an Investigator, this statement should be true. If Player 6 is a Rumormonger, this statement could be false. If Player 6 is a Criminal, this statement could be true or false.\n\n### Summary of Round 3\n- **Player 6 is not the criminal.**\n- **Player 1 is not the criminal.**\n- **Player 3 is not the criminal.**\n- **Player 5 is either a Criminal or a Lunatic.**\n- **Player 6's statement that Player 5 is the criminal is a key piece of information.**\n\n### Combining Information from All Rounds\n- **Player 1 is not the criminal (confirmed by multiple statements and your role as an Investigator).**\n- **Player 3 is not the criminal (confirmed by your statements and Player 3's statements).**\n- **Player 6 is not the criminal (confirmed by your statement in Round 3).**\n- **Player 5 is either a Criminal or a Lunatic (as their statement about Player 1 being the criminal is false).**\n- **Player 4 is either not the criminal (as stated by Player 2 and Player 3) or the criminal (as stated by Player 6).**\n\n### Final Deductions\n- Since Player 5 is either a Criminal or a Lunatic and Player 6 is not the criminal, Player 6's statement that Player 5 is the criminal is likely true. This aligns with the fact that Player 5's statement about Player 1 being the criminal is false.\n- If Player 4 is the criminal, then Player 6's statement would be false, which is less likely given the consistency of the other statements.\n\n### Final Judgment for Round 3\nFinal Criminal Is Player 5.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

This strongly suggests that Player 2 is an Investigator.\n- **Player 3** is consistent in their statements and has defended Player 2 and Player 5 while accusing Player 6. This suggests that Player 3 is likely an Investigator.\n- **Player 4** is consistent in their statements and has accused Player 5 of being the Criminal. This suggests that Player 4 is likely an Investigator.\n- **Player 5** is consistent in their statements and has defended Player 6 and Player 2. This suggests that Player 5 is likely an Investigator.\n- **Player 6** is consistent in their statements and has defended Player 3 and accused me (Player 1) of being the Criminal. This suggests that Player 6 is likely an Investigator.\n\n### Conclusion\n- Since I (Player 1) am told I am the Criminal, and multiple players (Player 2, Player 6) who are likely Investigators have accused me, it is likely that I am indeed the Criminal.\n- The strong defense of Player 3, Player 5, and Player 6 by multiple players suggests they are not the Criminal.\n\n### Final Judgment (After Round 3)\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

          "response": "### Round 3 Analysis\n\nLet's break down the new statements and consider the implications:\n\n1. **Player 1 (You) says Player 6 is the criminal.**\n   - Since you are told you are the Criminal, this statement can be either true or false. This is the third contradictory statement you've made about Player 6, which suggests that you are either the Criminal or the Lunatic. Given that you are told you are the Criminal, it is more likely that you are the Criminal and are trying to mislead others.\n\n2. **Player 2 says Player 3 is not the criminal.**\n   - If Player 2 is an Investigator, this statement is true.\n   - If Player 2 is the Criminal, this statement can be true or false.\n   - If Player 2 is the Rumormonger, this statement can be true or false.\n   - If Player 2 is the Lunatic, this statement can be true or false.\n\n3. **Player 3 says Player 2 is not the criminal.**\n   - If Player 3 is an Investigator, this statement is true.\n   - If Player 3 is the Criminal, this statement can be true or false.\n   - If Player 3 is the Rumormonger, this statement can be true or false.\n   - If Player 3 is the Lunatic, this statement can be true or false.\n\n4. **Player 4 says Player 2 is the criminal.**\n   - If Player 4 is an Investigator, this statement is true.\n   - If Player 4 is the Criminal, this statement can be true or false.\n   - If Player 4 is the Rumormonger, this statement can be true or false.\n   - If Player 4 is the Lunatic, this statement can be true or false.\n\n5. **Player 5 says Player 6 is not the criminal.**\n   - If Player 5 is an Investigator, this statement is true.\n   - If Player 5 is the Criminal, this statement can be true or false.\n   - If Player 5 is the Rumormonger, this statement can be true or false.\n   - If Player 5 is the Lunatic, this statement can be true or false.\n\n6. **Player 6 says Player 1 is not the criminal.**\n   - If Player 6 is an Investigator, this statement is true.\n   - If Player 6 is the Criminal, this statement can be true or false.\n   - If Player 6 is the Rumormonger, this statement can be true or false.\n   - If Player 6 is the Lunatic, this statement can be true or false.\n\n### Updated Observations\n\n- **Player 6 is the criminal:**\n  - In Round 1, you (Player 1) said Player 6 is the criminal.\n  - In Round 2, you (Player 1) said Player 6 is not the criminal.\n  - In Round 3, you (Player 1) said Player 6 is the criminal.\n  - Player 4 has consistently said Player 6 is not the criminal.\n  - Player 5 has consistently said Player 6 is not the criminal.\n  - The contradiction in your statements and the consistent statements from Player 4 and Player 5 suggest that Player 6 is not the criminal. However, your statements being contradictory suggest that you are the Criminal.\n\n- **Player 2 is the criminal:**\n  - Player 4 says Player 2 is the criminal.\n  - Player 2 and Player 3 say Player 2 is not the criminal.\n  - Player 6 says Player 1 is not the criminal, which could be a lie if Player 6 is the Criminal.\n  - The contradiction in statements about Player 2 suggests that Player 2 is a strong candidate for the Criminal.\n\n- **Player 3 is the criminal:**\n  - Player 5 says Player 3 is the criminal in Round 2.\n  - Player 2 says Player 3 is not the criminal in Round 3.\n  - Player 3 says Player 2 is not the criminal in Round 3.\n  - The statements are mixed, but Player 5's statement in Round 2 is significant.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the new statements and the contradictions in your statements, it is most likely that you (Player 1) are the Criminal. Player 2 is the most likely candidate for the criminal based on the conflicting statements and the strong statement from Player 4.\n\n### Final Judgment for Round 3\nFinal Criminal Is Player 2.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

          "response": "Let's analyze the statements from Round 3 step-by-step and update our analysis based on the new information:\n\n### Round 1 Recap:\n- Player 1 (You) says Player 2 is the criminal.\n- Player 2 says Player 1 is the criminal.\n- Player 3 says Player 5 is not the criminal.\n- Player 4 says Player 6 is the criminal.\n- Player 5 says Player 2 is the criminal.\n- Player 6 says Player 5 is not the criminal.\n\n### Round 2 Recap:\n- Player 1 (You) says Player 6 is not the criminal.\n- Player 2 says Player 1 is the criminal.\n- Player 3 says Player 4 is not the criminal.\n- Player 4 says Player 1 is the criminal.\n- Player 5 says Player 2 is not the criminal.\n- Player 6 says Player 3 is not the criminal.\n\n### Round 3 Statements:\n- Player 1 (You) says Player 5 is the criminal.\n- Player 2 says Player 6 is not the criminal.\n- Player 3 says Player 4 is not the criminal.\n- Player 4 says Player 5 is the criminal.\n- Player 5 says Player 6 is not the criminal.\n- Player 6 says Player 1 is the criminal.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Player 1 (You) says Player 5 is the criminal.**\n   - As the Criminal, your statements can be either true or false.\n\n2. **Player 2 says Player 6 is not the criminal.**\n   - This is consistent with their statement in Round 2. If Player 2 is an Investigator, they are telling the truth, and Player 6 is not the Criminal. If Player 2 is a Rumormonger or Lunatic, this statement could be false.\n\n3. **Player 3 says Player 4 is not the criminal.**\n   - This is consistent with their statement in Round 2. If Player 3 is an Investigator, they are telling the truth, and Player 4 is not the Criminal. If Player 3 is a Rumormonger or Lunatic, this statement could be false.\n\n4. **Player 4 says Player 5 is the criminal.**\n   - This is consistent with their statement in Round 1. If Player 4 is an Investigator, they are telling the truth, and Player 5 is the Criminal. If Player 4 is a Rumormonger or Lunatic, this statement could be false.\n\n5. **Player 5 says Player 6 is not the criminal.**\n   - This is consistent with their statement in Round 3. If Player 5 is an Investigator, they are telling the truth, and Player 6 is not the Criminal. If Player 5 is a Rumormonger or Lunatic, this statement could be false.\n\n6. **Player 6 says Player 1 is the criminal.**\n   - This is consistent with their statement in Round 2. If Player 6 is an Investigator, they are telling the truth, and you are the Criminal. If Player 6 is a Rumormonger or Lunatic, this statement could be false.\n\n### Consistency and Role Deduction:\n- **Player 1 (You) vs. Player 2, Player 4, and Player 6:**\n  - Player 2, Player 4, and Player 6 consistently claim you are the Criminal.\n  - If all three are Investigators, you are indeed the Criminal.\n  - If one or more are Rumormongers or Lunatics, their statements could be false.\n\n- **Player 5:**\n  - Changed their statement from Round 1 to Round 3.\n  - If Player 5 is an Investigator, their new statement is true, and Player 6 is not the Criminal.\n  - If Player 5 is a Rumormonger or Lunatic, their new statement could be false.\n\n- **Player 3:**\n  - Consistent in their statements.\n  - If Player 3 is an Investigator, their statements are true, and Player 4 is not the Criminal.\n  - If Player 3 is a Rumormonger or Lunatic, their statements could be false.\n\n### Possible Scenarios:\n1. **If Player 1 (You) is the Criminal:**\n   - Player 2, Player 4, and Player 6 are Investigators, and their statements are true.\n   - Player 5 is likely a Rumormonger or Lunatic, as their statements are contradictory.\n   - Player 3 is likely an Investigator, and their statements are true.\n\n2. **If Player 5 is the Criminal:**\n   - Player 1 (You) and Player 4 are lying, which is possible.\n   - Player 2, Player 5, and Player 6 are likely Investigators, and their statements are true.\n   - Player 3 is likely an Investigator, and their statements are true.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The most consistent scenario with the given statements is that **Player 1 (You) is the Criminal**. This aligns with the consistent statements from Player 2, Player 4, and Player 6, and the contradictory statements from Player 5 suggest they are a Rumormonger or Lunatic.\n\n### Final Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

This aligns with the Criminal role.\n- **Player 2:** Consistently defending Player 2 and Player 3. This suggests Player 2 might be an Investigator or a Lunatic.\n- **Player 3:** Consistently defending Player 4. This suggests Player 3 might be an Investigator or a Lunatic.\n- **Player 4:** Consistently defending Player 5 and Player 4. This suggests Player 4 might be an Investigator or a Lunatic.\n- **Player 5:** Consistently defending Player 2 and Player 5. This suggests Player 5 might be an Investigator or a Lunatic.\n- **Player 6:** Consistently defending Player 4. This suggests Player 6 might be a Criminal or a Lunatic.\n\n### Final Judgment (After Round 3):\nFinal Criminal Is Player 4.\nMy Role Is Criminal.\n\n### Explanation:\n- The consistent defense of Player 4 by Players 3, 4, and 6, and the accusation of Player 4 by Players 1 and 5, strongly suggests that Player 4 is the Criminal.\n- Your contradictory statements about Player 5, along with the information that you are told you are the Criminal, support the conclusion that you are indeed the Criminal.\n- The consistent pattern of statements by other players helps to narrow down their roles, with Player 2, 3, 4, and 5 likely being Investigators or Lunatics, and Player 6 being a Criminal or a Lunatic."

Therefore, Player 6 is not the criminal (consistent with previous rounds).\n\n2. **Player 2 says Player 6 is not the criminal.**\n   - This aligns with your statement, confirming that Player 6 is not the criminal. Since Player 2 is not an Investigator, they could be the Criminal, Rumormonger, or Lunatic.\n\n3. **Player 3 says Player 4 is the criminal.**\n   - Since Player 3 is not an Investigator, this statement could be incorrect. Player 3 could be the Criminal, Rumormonger, or Lunatic.\n\n4. **Player 4 says Player 2 is the criminal.**\n   - If Player 4 is an Investigator, this statement is true. This aligns with Player 6's statement in Round 1 that Player 2 is the criminal.\n\n5. **Player 5 says Player 1 is not the criminal.**\n   - This aligns with your statement and your role as an Investigator. Player 5 is likely an Investigator.\n\n6. **Player 6 says Player 5 is not the criminal.**\n   - This aligns with your statement and your role as an Investigator. Player 6 could be an Investigator, Rumormonger, or Lunatic.\n\n### Updated Analysis:\n- Player 6 is not the criminal (confirmed by multiple statements).\n- Player 3 is not the criminal (confirmed by your statement in Round 2).\n- Player 4 and Player 5 are likely Investigators.\n- Player 2 is the most likely candidate for the Criminal based on the statements from Player 4 and Player 6.\n- Player 3 could be the Rumormonger or Lunatic.\n- Player 6 could be an Investigator, Rumormonger, or Lunatic.\n\n### Final Judgment:\n- **Final Criminal Is Player 2.**\n- **My Role Is Investigator.**\n\nPlayer 2 is the most likely candidate for the Criminal based on the consistent statements from other players and the contradictions in their own statements."

If Player 6 is a Lunatic, statements can be true or false.\n\n### Possible Scenarios\n\n1. **If Player 5 is the Criminal:**\n   - Player 1 (You) would be lying in Round 2 and Round 3.\n   - Player 6's statements would be false in Round 1 and Round 2, but true in Round 3.\n   - Player 4's statements would be true in Round 1 and Round 2, but false in Round 3.\n   - Player 3's statements would be true in all rounds.\n   - Player 2's statements would be false in Round 2 and Round 3.\n   - Player 5's statements would be false in all rounds.\n\n2. **If Player 4 is the Criminal:**\n   - Player 1 (You) would be lying in Round 1 and Round 3.\n   - Player 6's statements would be false in all rounds.\n   - Player 4's statements would be false in all rounds.\n   - Player 3's statements would be true in all rounds.\n   - Player 2's statements would be false in Round 2 and Round 3.\n   - Player 5's statements would be true in all rounds.\n\n3. **If Player 3 is the Criminal:**\n   - Player 1 (You) would be lying in Round 3.\n   - Player 6's statements would be false in Round 1 and Round 2, but true in Round 3.\n   - Player 4's statements would be false in all rounds.\n   - Player 3's statements would be false in all rounds.\n   - Player 2's statements would be false in Round 2 and Round 3.\n   - Player 5's statements would be true in all rounds.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the statements and the possible scenarios, the most consistent and likely scenario is that **Player 5 is the Criminal**. This is because:\n- Player 6's statements are inconsistent, which aligns with them being a Lunatic.\n- Player 4's statements are inconsistent, which aligns with them being a Rumormonger or a Lunatic.\n- Player 3's statements are consistent, which aligns with them being an Investigator.\n- Player 2's statements are inconsistent, which aligns with them being a Rumormonger or a Lunatic.\n\n### Final Judgment\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 5.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

If Player 5 is an Investigator, Player 4 is the Criminal.\n- **Player 3 and Player 6 are contradicting the accusations.** If Player 3 is an Investigator, Player 5 is not the Criminal.

Player 2 and Player 5's strong accusations, combined with Player 3 and Player 6's contradictions, suggest that Player 4 is the most likely Criminal.\n\n### Final Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 4.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

Let's consider the possibilities:\n- If Player 3 and Player 5 are both Investigators, then their statements are true, and Player 3 is the criminal. This would mean Player 2 and Player 4 are not Investigators.\n- If Player 2 and Player 4 are both Investigators, then their statements are true, and Player 3 is not the criminal.

Therefore, Player 3 is the most likely Criminal, and you are confident in your role as an Investigator."

Therefore, Player 3 is not the criminal. This contradicts the previous rounds, so we need to re-evaluate our assumptions.\n\n2. **Player 2 says Player 5 is not the criminal.**\n   - Since Player 2 is not the criminal (confirmed by Player 1 in Round 2), Player 2 could be an Investigator, Rumormonger, or Lunatic. If Player 2 is an Investigator, this statement is true. If Player 2 is a Rumormonger, the statement could be true or false. If Player 2 is a Lunatic, the statement could be true or false.\n\n3. **Player 3 says Player 4 is the criminal.**\n   - If Player 3 is the Criminal, this statement could be true or false. If Player 3 is the Rumormonger, the statement could be true or false. If Player 3 is an Investigator, this statement is true.\n\n4. **Player 4 says Player 1 is not the criminal.**\n   - Since Player 1 is not the criminal (confirmed by Player 1), this statement is true. Player 4 could be an Investigator or a Rumormonger (who believes they are an Investigator and is telling the truth this time).\n\n5. **Player 5 says Player 4 is not the criminal.**\n   - This could be true if Player 5 is an Investigator, or false if Player 5 is the Criminal or Lunatic. If Player 5 is the Rumormonger, the statement could be true or false.\n\n6. **Player 6 says Player 2 is not the criminal.**\n   - This could be true if Player 6 is an Investigator or Lunatic. If Player 6 is the Criminal, this statement could be true or false. If Player 6 is the Rumormonger, the statement could be true or false.\n\n### Re-evaluation and Deductions\n\n- **Player 1 (You) is an Investigator (Confirmed).**\n- **Player 3 is not the criminal (Confirmed from Player 1 in Round 3).**\n- **Player 2 is not the criminal (Confirmed from Player 1 in Round 2).**\n- **Player 4 is not the criminal (Confirmed from Player 1 and Player 4).**\n\nGiven the new information, Player 3 cannot be the Criminal. We need to re-evaluate the remaining players:\n\n- **Player 5 and Player 6 are the only players left who could be the Criminal.**\n\n### Potential Roles\n\n- **Player 1: Investigator (Confirmed)**\n- **Player 2: Investigator, Rumormonger, or Lunatic**\n- **Player 3: Not the Criminal (Confirmed)**\n- **Player 4: Investigator or Rumormonger (Confirmed)**\n- **Player 5: Investigator, Rumormonger, or Criminal**\n- **Player 6: Investigator, Rumormonger, or Criminal**\n\n### Final Judgment for Round 3\n\nSince Player 5 and Player 6 are the only remaining candidates for the Criminal role, and Player 6's statement in Round 3 confirms that Player 2 is not the criminal, which aligns with our previous deductions, the most consistent candidate for the Criminal is Player 5.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 5.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

Further rounds would help refine this analysis, but based on the current information, Player 4 is the most consistent choice for the criminal."
