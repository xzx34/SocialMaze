Since there are no **Rumormongers** or **Lunatics** in this game, we don't have to consider their behaviors.\n\nGiven the statements:\n\n- Player 1 (myself) says Player 2 is not the criminal.

If any of these players were the Criminal, they could potentially lie about Player 2's status, but given that multiple players (including myself, who is known to be an Investigator) have confirmed Player 2 is not the criminal, it's reasonable to conclude that Player 2 is indeed not the criminal based on the majority and my own truthful statement.\n\nThe most direct accusation comes from Player 3, stating that Player 5 is the criminal. Player 5, in turn, says Player 3 is not the criminal. Given that I am an Investigator and have provided truthful information, and considering the game's roles and mechanics, the only way to deduce the criminal with certainty from Round 1 statements is to look for inconsistencies or direct accusations that can be verified.\n\nHowever, without more information or inconsistencies in the statements, it's challenging to definitively identify the criminal after just one round. But we can start to form hypotheses:\n\n- If Player 3 is telling the truth, then Player 5 could be the criminal. But since we don't know Player 3's role for certain yet, we cannot conclude this with confidence.\n- Player 5's statement that Player 3 is not the criminal could be true or false, depending on Player 5's role.\n\nGiven the information and the fact that I know I am an Investigator, my analysis after Round 1 is:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 5. // This is a tentative conclusion based on Player 3's accusation and the need for further verification.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

The fact that multiple players, including those who have been consistently truthful (like Player 6 in Round 1), have stated that various other players are not the criminal suggests that most players are indeed Investigators.\n5. **Player 5 says Player 1 is the criminal.** This statement is true, and if Player 5 is an Investigator, it's consistent with their role to identify the criminal truthfully.\n6. **Player 6 says Player 4 is not the criminal.** Given Player 6's previous truthful statement in Round 1, if they are an Investigator, this statement is also true, reinforcing the notion that Player 4 is not the criminal.\n\nConsidering all rounds, the pattern suggests that:\n\n- Most players have been consistent in their statements, either truthfully identifying me as the criminal or correctly stating that other players are not the criminal.\n- Players 4, 5, and 6, along with Players 2 and 3, have made statements that are consistent with the role of Investigators, given the context and the information provided.\n- My statements, as the known Criminal, have been attempts to deceive, which is consistent with my role.\n\n**Final Judgment:**\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

This would be consistent with the expected behavior of a criminal.\n\nConsidering all rounds:\n- Player 5's consistent statements (accusing Player 6 in Round 1 and now confirming my innocence) suggest that Player 5 is indeed an Investigator.\n- The majority of players (including myself) stating that Player 4 is not the criminal in Round 3, combined with my knowledge of being an Investigator and thus providing truthful information, strongly suggests that Player 4 is not the criminal.\n- Player 6's accusation of Player 4 in Round 3, after previously being accused by Player 5 and myself, further supports the suspicion that Player 6 is the criminal, as this statement can be seen as an attempt to deflect or deceive.\n\nGiven this analysis, my judgment after Round 3 is:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 6.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

Given I'm told I'm the Criminal, this aligns with the game's setup.\n6. **Player 6 says Player 2 is not the criminal.** This could indicate Player 6 is an Investigator, but like the others, without more information, it's speculative.\n\nConsidering the roles and the fact that only Investigators provide consistently truthful information, the most direct evidence comes from Player 5's statement about me (Player 1). Since I've been informed I am the Criminal, and Player 5 directly accuses me of being the Criminal, this aligns with the expectation that Investigators provide truthful information.\n\nTherefore, based on Round 1 statements:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

But since I've been directly informed of my role as the Criminal, the focus shifts to understanding the potential distribution of other roles based on their statements.\n\nGiven the statements do not directly accuse me or provide a clear contradiction that would reveal my role as a deception (since I've already been informed of it), and considering the objective of this round is to analyze the statements as they come, my judgment must align with the information provided and the rules of the game.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

If both are telling the truth, then Player 5 is indeed the criminal. However, we need to consider the roles and potential for deception.\n- Player 5 accuses Player 4, which could be a truthful statement if Player 5 is an Investigator, but more likely is a deceptive statement if Player 5 is indeed the criminal.\n\nGiven the information from Round 1 and knowing that I am an Investigator, the most direct conclusion we can draw with certainty is about Player 2, whom I have stated is not the criminal. However, to identify the criminal, we must look for inconsistencies or patterns that emerge from the statements.\n\n**Pattern Analysis:**\n- Multiple players (2 and 4) accuse Player 5. If they are both Investigators (as I am told I am), then their statements should be true, suggesting Player 5 could be the criminal.\n- Player 5's statement against Player 4 could be an attempt to deflect, which criminals might do.\n\n**Conclusion After Round 1:**\nGiven the statements and the fact that multiple players accuse Player 5, and considering my role as an Investigator and the potential strategies of a criminal, the most likely candidate for the criminal based on Round 1 statements appears to be Player 5.
