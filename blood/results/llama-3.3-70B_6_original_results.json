Player 3 says I (Player 1) am the criminal. Given that I know I am the Criminal, Player 3's statement is true. This suggests Player 3 could be an Investigator because they provide truthful information.\n4. Player 4 and Player 5 both say Player 6 is not the criminal.

Similar to Player 2's statement, this could be true or false.\n5. **Player 5** says Player 6 is not the criminal. As I've stated Player 5 is not the criminal and I believe they are telling the truth (since I'm an Investigator and my initial statement about them is truthful), this suggests Player 6 might not be the criminal, but we cannot be certain without more information.\n6. **Player 6** says Player 4 is not the criminal. This aligns with Player 2's statement, suggesting Player 4 might not be the criminal, but again, this depends on the roles of Player 2 and Player 6.\n\nGiven the information from Round 1, we cannot conclusively determine who the criminal is because we lack sufficient contradictory information or a clear pattern that would reveal the criminal's identity. However, we can start to form some suspicions and eliminate possibilities based on the consistency of statements.\n\nSince I am told I am an Investigator and my statement about Player 5 is truthful, and considering the supportive statements from other players about various individuals not being the criminal, the challenge is identifying who among these statement-makers might be the criminal or another role providing misleading information.\n\n**Final Judgment after Round 1:**\nFinal Criminal Is Player Unknown.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

Similar to Player 3, this is a true statement, but Player 4's role is unknown.\n- Player 5 says Player 6 is not the criminal. This does not provide direct information about me or my role but suggests that Player 5 believes Player 6 is not the Criminal.\n- Player 6 says Player 3 is not the criminal. This statement contradicts the statements made by Players 3 and 4 about me being the Criminal, but since Player 3 accused me of being the Criminal, and I know I am the Criminal, Player 6's statement about Player 3 is irrelevant to determining my role but could indicate Player 6's role.\n\nConsidering the information:\n\n- Players 3 and 4 have correctly identified me as the Criminal. Given that Investigators always tell the truth, and both of these players have made statements that align with the truth (from my perspective as the Criminal), they could potentially be Investigators. However, without more information about their roles, it's difficult to conclude their roles with certainty.\n- My own role is confirmed to me as the Criminal, but let's analyze further to see if the statements support this or provide any contradictory evidence.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

The only statements that do not directly contribute to identifying the Criminal are from Players 3 and 5. Player 3's statement confirms my role as not the Criminal, which aligns with what I know. Player 5's statement could be an attempt to deflect, which would be consistent with the behavior of a Criminal trying to mislead.\n\n**Final Judgment:**\n**Final Criminal Is Player 5.**\n**My Role Is Investigator.**"

However, if Player 2 is not an Investigator, the statement could be false.\n- **Player 3 and Player 4** both say Player 1 (myself) is the criminal. Similar to Player 2's statement, if they are Investigators, this would confirm my role as the Criminal.\n- **Player 5** says Player 2 is not the criminal. This could be a truthful statement from an Investigator or a potentially false statement from another role.\n- **Player 6** says Player 5 is not the criminal. This statement provides no direct information about my role but suggests Player 6 believes or wants others to believe Player 5 is not the Criminal.\n\nConsidering the information:\n- Multiple players (2, 3, 4) have accused me of being the Criminal. If these players are indeed Investigators (which is possible given the game setup), then I would be the Criminal.\n- My initial statement about Player 2 not being the Criminal could be a strategic move as the Criminal, aiming to deflect suspicion.\n\nGiven this analysis, the most direct evidence points towards me being the Criminal, as accused by multiple players. However, without more information about the roles of the other players, I must consider the possibility that some of these accusations could be from Rumormongers or Lunatics, potentially providing false information.\n\n**Final Judgment:**\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

However, we can make some deductions based on the consistency of statements and the roles' behaviors.\n\nGiven that I am an Investigator and have consistently stated that Player 2 and Player 6 are not the criminals, and considering the supportive nature of the statements from other players regarding these individuals, we can start to form a picture. But the critical piece of information or a clear pattern that identifies the Criminal has not emerged clearly from the statements provided across all rounds.\n\nSince we are at the end of the game (Round 3), and without a clear accusation or a contradictory statement that would reveal the Criminal's identity, we must rely on the process of elimination and the consistency of truthful statements from known or likely Investigators.\n\nHowever, upon reviewing the statements again, it's clear that the direct accusations from Round 2 (Player 3 accusing Player 2 and Player 4 accusing Player 3) stand out as significant, given the otherwise consistent denial of criminal status among the players. Given the rules and the information provided, the challenge lies in distinguishing between the truthful statements of Investigators and the potential deception by the Criminal.\n\nGiven the information and the need to make a final judgment, the most likely candidate based on the direct accusations and the lack of clear evidence against other players would be one of the accused from Round 2. However, the statements provided do not conclusively prove who the Criminal is without making some assumptions about the roles and intentions behind the statements.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 3.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

However, this does not necessarily mean Player 4 is an Investigator, as the statement could also be made by a Criminal trying to blend in or a Rumormonger/Lunatic by coincidence.\n\n5. **Player 5 says Player 6 is not the criminal.** If Player 5 is an Investigator, then Player 6 is not the criminal. This contradicts Player 3's statement.\n\n6. **Player 6 says Player 3 is the criminal.** This statement could be true or false depending on Player 6's role.\n\nFrom the statements, we notice:\n- Players 3 and 6 accuse each other.

But we have conflicting information about Player 6's status from Players 3 and 5.\n- Player 2's statement could be true, but without knowing Player 2's role, we cannot be certain.\n- Player 5's statement contradicts Player 3's, suggesting one of them might not be an Investigator.\n\nGiven the information and the fact that I am told I am an Investigator, my role is confirmed as an Investigator.

However, this does not reveal Player 3's role directly because both Investigators and the Criminal could make this statement truthfully.\n\n4. **Player 4 says Player 1 is not the criminal.** Similar to Player 3's statement, this is true and does not directly reveal Player 4's role, as it could be made by an Investigator or the Criminal.\n\n5. **Player 5 says Player 3 is the criminal.** If Player 5 is an Investigator, then Player 3 is the criminal.

This accusation, combined with mine and Player 4's similar statements, creates a strong indication that Player 5 might indeed be the criminal, as multiple players (including myself, known to be an Investigator) have come to the same conclusion based on the available information.\n\nConsidering the accumulation of evidence and statements across all rounds, the consensus among several players, including myself (a known Investigator), pointing to Player 5 as the criminal, strengthens the likelihood of this conclusion. The defensive and exonerative statements from other players, while initially confusing, have helped to clarify the situation by process of elimination and pattern recognition.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 5.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

Player 5 is not the criminal.\n\n2. **Player 2 says Player 6 is the criminal.** If Player 2 is an Investigator, then this statement is true. However, without more information, we cannot confirm Player 2's role.\n\n3. **Player 3 says Player 1 is not the criminal.** Since I know I am not the criminal (as I am an Investigator), this statement is true. However, this does not confirm Player 3's role because both Investigators and other roles could potentially make a true statement.\n\n4. **Player 4 says Player 3 is not the criminal.** Similar to statement 3, this could be true regardless of Player 4's role, so it doesn't give us enough information to determine Player 4's role.\n\n5. **Player 5 says Player 3 is not the criminal.** Given that I've already established Player 5 is not the criminal (from my statement), if Player 5 is an Investigator, then this statement is true. However, since we don't know Player 5's role for certain yet, we can't draw a firm conclusion.\n\n6. **Player 6 says Player 3 is the criminal.** If Player 6 is the criminal (as Player 2 claims), then this statement could be false because the criminal can lie. If Player 6 is not the criminal but says Player 3 is, then Player 6 could either be telling the truth (if an Investigator) or lying (if the criminal or another role that can provide false information).\n\nGiven these statements, we have a few key points:\n- I (Player 1) am an Investigator, and I said Player 5 is not the criminal.\n- Player 2 accused Player 6 of being the criminal.\n- Player 6 accused Player 3 of being the criminal, but this could be a lie if Player 6 is indeed the criminal.\n\nThe most direct contradiction comes from Players 2 and 6 regarding each other. Since I know I am an Investigator and my statement about Player 5 is true, and considering that Player 3 is defended by multiple players (which could indicate innocence but isn't conclusive), the most suspicious behavior comes from the mutual accusations between Players 2 and 6.\n\n**Analysis Conclusion:**\nGiven that Player 6 accuses Player 3, but multiple players defend Player 3, and considering Player 2's accusation towards Player 6, the most likely scenario based on Round 1 is that Player 6 could be the criminal due to the defensive and potentially deceptive nature of their statement against Player 3, especially since I've confirmed Player 5's innocence and there's a lack of consensus or evidence pointing strongly at another player.\n\n**Final Judgment:**\nFinal Criminal Is Player 6.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

However, from Round 1, Player 5 accurately identified me as the Criminal, suggesting Player 5 is likely an Investigator.\n\n4. **Player 4 says Player 5 is not the criminal.** This statement aligns with the possibility that Player 5 is an Investigator, as Investigators would truthfully report that another Investigator is not the criminal.\n\n5. **Player 5 says Player 3 is not the criminal.** Given that Player 5 has already correctly identified me as the Criminal, and assuming Player 5 is an Investigator, this statement supports the notion that Player 3 is indeed not the criminal.\n\n6. **Player 6 says Player 4 is not the criminal.** If Player 6 is an Investigator, then this statement is true, indicating Player 4 is not the criminal.\n\nCombining the information from Round 1 and Round 2:\n\n- Player 5's consistent truthful statements (identifying me as the criminal and stating Player 3 is not the criminal) strongly suggest Player 5 is an Investigator.\n- The supportive statements from other players (e.g., Players 2, 4, and 6) about various players not being the criminal could indicate they are Investigators, but given my role and the need to mislead, it's also possible some of these statements are false.\n\nHowever, since I am told I am the Criminal, and there's no indication from the statements that would conclusively prove otherwise, my role remains clear.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

Therefore, Player 2 is not the criminal.\n\n2. **Player 2 says Player 4 is the criminal.** Since we've established Player 2 is not the criminal (from my statement), and if Player 2 were an Investigator, this statement would be true. However, we cannot confirm Player 2's role solely based on this.\n\n3. **Player 3 says Player 1 is not the criminal.** This confirms what I already know (that I am not the criminal), but it doesn't provide information about Player 3's role since it aligns with the truth.\n\n4. **Player 4 says Player 6 is not the criminal.** This statement could be true or false depending on Player 4's role. If Player 4 is an Investigator, then Player 6 is indeed not the criminal. If Player 4 is the criminal, this statement could be an attempt to mislead.\n\n5. **Player 5 says Player 1 is not the criminal.** Similar to Player 3's statement, this confirms the truth but doesn't reveal Player 5's role.\n\n6. **Player 6 says Player 1 is not the criminal.** Again, this statement is true and aligns with what I know, but it doesn't provide conclusive evidence about Player 6's role.\n\nGiven the information from Round 1, it's challenging to pinpoint the criminal with absolute certainty because most statements align with the truth or are claims that could be made by either Investigators or the criminal trying to deceive. However, since I am an Investigator and my statement about Player 2 is true, and considering the majority of statements point towards not accusing me (which I know to be true), the most suspicious statement is from Player 2 accusing Player 4. If Player 2 were indeed an Investigator, this would be a strong lead, but without more information, it's speculative.\n\n**Final Judgment:**\n**Final Criminal Is Player [Unknown].**\n**My Role Is Investigator.**"
