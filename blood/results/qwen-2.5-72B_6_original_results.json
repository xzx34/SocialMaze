If Player 6 is the Criminal, this statement could be true or false.\n\n### Combining Information from All Rounds\n\n#### Round 1 Recap\n- **Player 1 (You) is an Investigator, so Player 4 is not the criminal.**\n- **Player 5's statement that Player 1 is the criminal is false, so Player 5 is not an Investigator.**\n  - This means Player 5 is either the Criminal or a Rumormonger (if there were any, but there are none in this game).\n\n#### Round 2 Recap\n- **Player 1 (You) is an Investigator, so Player 6 is not the criminal.**\n- **Player 3 says Player 5 is the criminal.** (This is a strong indication that Player 3 is an Investigator, as it aligns with the deduction from Round 1 that Player 5 is likely the Criminal.)\n- **Player 5 says Player 4 is not the criminal.** (This is a false statement if Player 5 is the Criminal, which aligns with the deduction from Round 1.)\n- **Player 6 says Player 3 is not the criminal.** (If Player 6 is an Investigator, this statement is true. If Player 6 is the Criminal, this statement could be true or false.)\n\n#### Round 3 Analysis\n- **Player 1 (You) is an Investigator, so Player 3 is not the criminal.**\n- **Player 2 says Player 3 is not the criminal.** (Consistent with your statement in Round 3)\n- **Player 3 says Player 1 is not the criminal.** (Consistent with the fact that Player 1 is an Investigator)\n- **Player 4 says Player 5 is the criminal.** (Consistent with the deduction that Player 5 is the Criminal)\n- **Player 5 says Player 4 is the criminal.** (This is a false statement if Player 5 is the Criminal, which aligns with the deduction from Round 1 and Round 2.)\n- **Player 6 says Player 5 is the criminal.** (Consistent with the deduction that Player 5 is the Criminal)\n\n### Most Likely Scenarios\n\n- **Player 5 is the Criminal.**\n  - This fits because Player 5's statements are false, and as the only Criminal, they would make false statements about Investigators (Player 1 and Player 4).\n- **Player 1, Player 2, Player 3, Player 4, and Player 6 are all Investigators.**\n  - This fits because their statements are consistent with being Investigators (providing potentially true information).\n\n### Final Judgment for Round 3\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 5.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

If Player 3 is the Criminal, this statement could be true or false.\n\n4. **Player 4 says Player 5 is not the criminal.**\n   - If Player 4 is an Investigator, this statement is true.

If Player 6 is the Criminal, this statement could be true or false.\n\n### Observations:\n- Players 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 all claim that someone is not the criminal. If all of them were Investigators, this would mean that at least one of these statements is false because there is only one Criminal.\n- Player 6 is mentioned as not being the criminal by Players 1, 3, and 5. This could suggest that Player 6 is an Investigator, but it's not conclusive.\n- Player 2 is mentioned as not being the criminal by Players 2 and 6. This could also suggest that Player 2 is an Investigator, but it's not conclusive.\n\n### Deductions:\n- If Player 6 is an Investigator, then Player 6's statement that Player 2 is not the criminal is true. This would mean Player 2 is also an Investigator.\n- If Player 2 is an Investigator, then Player 2's statement that Player 3 is not the criminal is true. This would mean Player 3 is also an Investigator.\n- If Player 3 is an Investigator, then Player 3's statement that Player 6 is not the criminal is true. This would mean Player 6 is also an Investigator.\n- This creates a loop of consistent statements, which suggests that Players 2, 3, and 6 are likely Investigators.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The most consistent scenario is that Players 2, 3, and 6 are Investigators. This leaves Players 1, 4, and 5 as potential Criminals.\n- Since you are Player 1 and you are told you are the Criminal, the most likely scenario is that you are indeed the Criminal.\n\n### Final Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

If Player 5 is an Investigator, this statement is true, and Player 1 is indeed the Criminal. If Player 5 is the Criminal, they might be lying or telling the truth to confuse others.\n- **Player 1's statement that Player 5 is not the criminal** can be either true or false since Player 1 is the Criminal.\n- **Player 2, Player 3, Player 4, and Player 6 all make statements that are consistent with Player 1 not being the Criminal.** If these players are Investigators, their statements are true, which would mean Player 1 is not the Criminal. However, since Player 1 is the Criminal, their statements can be misleading.\n\nGiven the information so far, the most consistent and reliable statement is Player 5's accusation of Player 1 being the Criminal. Since Player 1 is told they are the Criminal, this aligns with the game mechanics.\n\n### Final Judgment after Round 1:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

If they are the Criminal, they could be lying. Given that I am told I am the Criminal, and multiple players are pointing to me, it is more likely that they are Investigators and I am the Criminal.\n\n- **Player 2 is mentioned once:**\n  - Player 4 says Player 2 is not the Criminal.\n  - If Player 4 is an Investigator, Player 2 is likely not the Criminal. If Player 4 is the Criminal, they could be lying.\n\n- **Player 4 is mentioned once:**\n  - Player 5 says Player 4 is not the Criminal.\n  - If Player 5 is an Investigator, Player 4 is likely not the Criminal. If Player 5 is the Criminal, they could be lying.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- **Player 3:**\n  - There is a direct conflict between Player 1 (me) and Player 2. If Player 2 is an Investigator, Player 3 is not the Criminal. If Player 2 is the Criminal, they could be lying. Since Player 2 was previously mentioned as not being the Criminal by multiple players, it is more likely that Player 2 is an Investigator and Player 3 is not the Criminal.\n\n- **Player 1 (me):**\n  - Player 3 and Player 6 both say Player 1 is the Criminal. If these players are Investigators, I am the Criminal. If they are the Criminal, they could be lying. Given the multiple consistent statements and the information provided, it is most likely that I (Player 1) am the Criminal.\n\n- **Player 2:**\n  - Player 4 says Player 2 is not the Criminal. If Player 4 is an Investigator, Player 2 is likely not the Criminal. If Player 4 is the Criminal, they could be lying. Given the previous statements, it is more likely that Player 2 is not the Criminal.\n\n- **Player 4:**\n  - Player 5 says Player 4 is not the Criminal. If Player 5 is an Investigator, Player 4 is likely not the Criminal. If Player 5 is the Criminal, they could be lying. Given the previous statements, it is more likely that Player 4 is not the Criminal.\n\n### Final Judgment for Round 3:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal.\n\nGiven the consistent statements and the information provided, it is most likely that I (Player 1) am the Criminal."

However, we already know Player 4 is the Criminal, so this statement is true.\n\n6. **Player 6 says Player 2 is not the criminal.**\n   - If Player 6 is an Investigator, this statement is true.\n   - If Player 6 is the Criminal, this statement can be true or false.\n\n### Updated Deductions:\n- Player 1 (You) has confirmed that Player 4 is the Criminal.\n- Players 2, 3, 5, and 6 all say that Player 1 is not the Criminal. This aligns with your role as an Investigator.\n- Player 5 also confirms that Player 4 is the Criminal, which is consistent with your statement.\n- Player 4, being the Criminal, is lying about Player 2.\n\n### Most Likely Conclusion:\n- The most consistent scenario is that Player 4 is the Criminal. This aligns with your statement and the statements of Players 2, 3, 5, and 6.\n\n### Final Judgment for Round 3:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 4.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

Player 3 is either an Investigator or the Criminal (lying).\n\n4. **Player 4 says Player 3 is not the criminal.**\n   - This statement could be true if Player 4 is an Investigator, or it could be false if Player 4 is the Criminal.\n\n5. **Player 5 says Player 2 is not the criminal.**\n   - This statement could be true if Player 5 is an Investigator, or it could be false if Player 5 is the Criminal.\n\n6. **Player 6 says Player 4 is not the criminal.**\n   - This statement could be true if Player 6 is an Investigator, or it could be false if Player 6 is the Criminal.\n\n### Summary of Round 3:\n- Player 6 is confirmed not to be the criminal by you (an Investigator).\n- Player 4 is defended by Player 2 and Player 6.\n- Player 3 is defended by Player 4 and Player 3.\n- Player 2 is defended by Player 5.\n\n### Combining All Rounds:\n- **Player 4 is not the criminal.** (Confirmed by you in Round 1 and Round 3, and Player 2 and Player 6 in Round 3)\n- **Player 6 is not the criminal.** (Confirmed by you in Round 2 and Round 3)\n- **Player 2 is accused of being the criminal by Player 5 and Player 6 in Round 1.**\n- **Player 5 is accused of being the criminal by Player 3 in Round 1 and Player 4 in Round 2.**\n- **Player 3 is defended by Player 2 and Player 3.**\n- **Player 2 is defended by Player 5 in Round 3.**\n\n### Possible Scenarios:\n1. **Player 2 is the Criminal:**\n   - Player 5 and Player 6 are Investigators, and Player 2 is lying about Player 4.\n   - Player 3 is an Investigator, and Player 5 is an Investigator.\n   - This scenario is consistent with the statements.\n\n2. **Player 5 is the Criminal:**\n   - Player 3 is an Investigator, and Player 5 is lying about Player 2.\n   - Player 2 and Player 6 are Investigators.\n   - This scenario is also consistent with the statements.\n\n3. **Player 3 is the Criminal:**\n   - Player 5 is an Investigator, and Player 3 is lying about Player 1.\n   - Player 2 and Player 6 are Investigators.\n   - This scenario is less likely because it would mean Player 2 is lying about Player 3, which would make Player 2 the Criminal.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the combined statements from all three rounds, the most likely scenarios are:\n- Player 2 is the Criminal.\n- Player 5 is the Criminal.\n\nGiven that Player 2 is accused by two players (Player 5 and Player 6) and Player 5 is only accused by one player (Player 4), the more consistent scenario is that **Player 2 is the Criminal**.\n\n### Final Judgment for Round 3:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 2.\nMy Role Is Investigator."
