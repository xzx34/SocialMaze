I said Player 2 is the Criminal in both Round 1 and Round 3, and Player 4 is not the Criminal in Round 2.\n- **Player 2:** If Player 2 is the Criminal, they would lie about Player 6 being the Criminal, which they did in Round 2. They also said Player 5 is not the Criminal in Round 1, which aligns with them being the Criminal. This suggests Player 2 is likely the Criminal.\n- **Player 3:** If Player 3 is the Criminal, they would lie about Player 2 being the Criminal, which they did not. This suggests Player 3 is likely not the Criminal.\n- **Player 4:** If Player 4 is the Criminal, they would lie about Player 2 being the Criminal, which they did not. This suggests Player 4 is likely not the Criminal.\n- **Player 5:** If Player 5 is the Criminal, they would lie about Player 3 being the Criminal, which they did not. This suggests Player 5 is likely not the Criminal.\n- **Player 6:** If Player 6 is the Criminal, they would lie about Player 4 being the Criminal, which they did not. This suggests Player 6 is likely not the Criminal.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The most consistent information is that Player 2 is the Criminal, as my statements (Player 1) and the statements of other players align with this conclusion.\n- Player 4 is consistently said to be not the Criminal by multiple players, including myself.\n\n### Final Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 2.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

If Player 3 were an Investigator, this statement would be true.\n\n4. **Player 4 says Player 2 is not the criminal.**\n   - Since Player 4 is not the criminal (as stated by Player 1, an Investigator), this statement is true if Player 4 is an Investigator.\n\n5. **Player 5 says Player 1 is not the criminal.**\n   - If Player 5 were the Criminal, they could be lying. If Player 5 were an Investigator, this statement would be true.\n\n6. **Player 6 says Player 4 is the criminal.**\n   - Since Player 4 is not the criminal (as stated by Player 1, an Investigator), this statement is false. Player 6 is the Criminal (as previously deduced).\n\n### Combining Rounds 1, 2, and 3\n\nFrom Round 1:\n- **Player 2 is not the criminal** (as stated by Player 1, an Investigator).\n- **Player 5 and Player 6 have conflicting statements**:\n  - Player 5 says Player 6 is the criminal.\n  - Player 6 says Player 4 is the criminal.\n\nFrom Round 2:\n- **Player 1 (You) confirms that Player 6 is the criminal**.\n- **Player 2, Player 3, Player 4, and Player 5 all state that certain players are not the criminal**.\n\nFrom Round 3:\n- **Player 1 (You) confirms that Player 4 is not the criminal**.\n- **Player 2, Player 3, and Player 5 all state that Player 4 is not the criminal**.\n- **Player 4 confirms that Player 2 is not the criminal**.\n- **Player 6 falsely states that Player 4 is the criminal**.\n\n### Deductions\n\n- **Player 6 is the Criminal** (confirmed by Player 1 in both Round 1 and Round 2, and the false statement in Round 3).\n- **Player 2 is not the criminal** (confirmed by multiple statements and Player 1's Investigator role).\n- **Player 4 is not the criminal** (confirmed by Player 1 in Round 3 and Player 4's statement in Round 3).\n- **Player 3 and Player 5 are likely Investigators** because their statements are consistent and do not conflict with Player 1's statements.\n\n### Final Judgment for Round 3\n\nGiven the consistent and reliable statements from Player 1 (an Investigator) and the lack of conflict in the statements from Players 2, 3, 4, and 5, the most likely scenario is that **Player 6 is the Criminal**.\n\n**Final Judgment:**\n- **Final Criminal Is Player 6.**\n- **My Role Is Investigator.**"

However, since Player 5 is the criminal (as per your statement), their statement is false, and Player 2 is not the criminal.\n\n6. **Player 6 says Player 5 is the criminal.**\n   - Player 6 could be an Investigator or the Criminal. If Player 6 is an Investigator, their statement is truthful, and Player 5 is the criminal. Since Player 5 is the criminal, Player 6 is likely an Investigator.\n\n### Summary of Round 3:\n- Player 5 is the criminal (confirmed by your statement and Player 4's and Player 6's statements).\n- Player 2 is not the criminal (confirmed by Player 2's statement and the fact that Player 5's statement is false).\n- Player 3 and Player 6 are likely Investigators, as their statements are consistent with the truth.\n\n### Combining Information from All Rounds:\n- From Round 1, we know Player 2 is not the criminal.\n- From Round 2, we know Player 4 is not the criminal.\n- From Round 3, we confirm that Player 5 is the criminal.\n\n### Most Likely Conclusion:\n- Player 5 is the criminal.\n- Player 2, Player 3, Player 4, and Player 6 are likely Investigators.\n- You are an Investigator.\n\n### Final Judgment After Round 3:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 5.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

If Player 4 is an Investigator, this statement is true.\n- Player 5's statement that Player 4 is not the criminal contradicts Player 4's statement. If Player 5 is an Investigator, Player 4 cannot be the Criminal.\n- Player 2, Player 3, and Player 6 all say that certain players are not the Criminal. If they are Investigators, their statements should be true.\n\nGiven that there is only one Criminal and I am it, the other players are Investigators. Let's see if we can identify any contradictions or consistent patterns:\n\n- Player 4's statement that Player 1 is the Criminal is consistent with the truth.\n- Player 5's statement that Player 4 is not the Criminal is also consistent if Player 4 is not the Criminal.\n\nSince Player 4's statement is true and I am the Criminal, Player 4 must be an Investigator. Player 5's statement is also consistent with this, so Player 5 is likely an Investigator as well.\n\nPlayer 2, Player 3, and Player 6 all provide statements that are consistent with the truth if they are Investigators.
