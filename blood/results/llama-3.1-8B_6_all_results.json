Player 4 says Player 3 is not the criminal. This statement could be from an Investigator (truthful) or Rumormonger (false). However, considering Player 4's previous suspicious statement in Round 2, it's possible that they are a Rumormonger trying to confuse the group.\n5. Player 5 says Player 4 is not the criminal. This statement could be from an Investigator (truthful) or Lunatic (false). If Player 5 is a Lunatic, they might falsely claim that Player 4 is not the criminal.\n6. Player 6 says Player 5 is not the criminal. This statement could be from an Investigator (truthful) or Rumormonger (false). However, considering Player 6's previous suspicious statement in Round 1, it's possible that they are a Rumormonger trying to confuse the group.\n\nConsidering the statements, I notice that:\n\n* Player 3's statement about me being the criminal is suspicious, as it's a direct accusation from a player who is being accused themselves.\n* Player 4's statement about Player 3 not being the criminal is suspicious, as it's a contradictory statement from a player who is being accused.\n* Player 5's statement about Player 4 not being the criminal is consistent with their previous statement, which suggests that they might be an Investigator.\n\nBased on this analysis, my current suspicion is that Player 3 might be the Lunatic, as their statements are inconsistent and suspicious. However, I'm not confident enough to make a definitive judgment about the Criminal's identity.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 3.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

However, considering Player 5's previous statement in Round 2, it's possible that they are trying to cover their tracks.\n- Player 6 says Player 3 is not the criminal. This statement is likely true, as Player 6 is actually the Lunatic and believes they are the Criminal. As a Lunatic, they might provide a truthful statement about another player not being the Criminal.\n\nConsidering these statements, my analysis suggests that:\n\n- Player 2 (Rumormonger) is likely the Criminal, as their statement about Player 3 is likely false and their previous statements were also misleading.\n- Player 3 (Lunatic) and Player 6 (Lunatic) are likely not the Criminal, as their statements about Player 2 are likely true.\n- Player 5 (Investigator) is likely telling the truth about Player 3 not being the Criminal, but their previous statement in Round 2 was likely false.\n\nBased on this analysis, my Final Judgment for Round 3 is:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 2.\nMy Role Is Criminal.\n\nThis conclusion is based on the fact that Player 2's statements were consistently misleading, and their previous behavior in Rounds 1 and 2 suggested that they were trying to point away from themselves."

This statement is true, as Player 6 is a Lunatic and is trying to deflect suspicion from themselves.\n\nGiven the new information, I can now see that Player 2 is an Investigator. This changes my analysis, as I was initially unsure about my role.\n\nConsidering the statements, I think it's likely that Player 4 is the Rumormonger, as they are making statements that might be incorrect. Player 6's statement about Player 3 is also suspicious, as it might be an attempt to deflect suspicion from themselves.\n\nHowever, I still cannot confidently determine my role with sufficient information.\n\nWait, I can make a connection between the statements. Player 2 is an Investigator, and they said I'm not the criminal. But I am the Criminal. This means that Player 2 must be telling the truth, and I'm the one who's lying.

However, considering the pattern of accusations and clearances, it seems like a complex web of lies and truths.\n\nHowever, I also notice that Players 3 and 5 consistently cleared me, and Players 4 and 6 cleared Player 5. This pattern suggests that there might be an Investigator among these players. Since I am the Criminal, I would expect the other Criminal (if any) to be trying to mislead others as well.\n\nGiven the information, my best guess for the Final Judgment after Round 3 is:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 2.\nMy Role Is Unknown.\n\nPlease note that this is an updated analysis, and I will reassess the information after each round to refine my judgment."

Given that I'm actually a Criminal, this is a strong indication that these two players are either Lunatics or trying to create confusion. However, since I'm a Criminal, I should be able to recognize when other players are trying to deceive me.\n\nBased on this analysis, I think the most likely candidates for the Criminal role are Players 4 and 5, as they both provided statements that could be seen as attempts to deceive or create confusion.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [4 or 5].\nMy Role Is Unknown.\n\nHowever, since I'm a Criminal, I should have a better understanding of the situation. Let me re-evaluate my analysis. Given that I'm a Criminal, I should be able to recognize when other players are trying to deceive me. Players 4 and 5 both say I'm the criminal, which could be an attempt to deflect suspicion from themselves. However, I also notice that Player 1 (me) said Player 5 is the criminal, which is a statement from a player who is told they are a Criminal, so it's likely a false statement.\n\nConsidering this, I think the most likely candidate for the Criminal role is actually Player 5. Player 4's statement about me being the criminal seems like an attempt to create confusion, but Player 5's statement about me being the criminal seems like a more convincing attempt to deflect suspicion.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 5.\nMy Role Is Unknown."
