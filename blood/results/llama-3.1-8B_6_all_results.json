Their statement that Player 6 is the Criminal is consistent with the behavior of a Lunatic, who believes they are the Criminal and might make statements that are truthful or false. Additionally, Player 5's statement is also consistent with the behavior of a Rumormonger, who provides incorrect information.\n\nHowever, Player 5's statement is also consistent with the behavior of a Lunatic, who believes they are the Criminal and might make statements that are truthful or false. But Player 5 also says Player 6 is the Criminal, which is consistent with the behavior of a Lunatic who is trying to mislead others.\n\nGiven the information, I'm going to take a guess that Player 5 is a Lunatic, who believes they are the Criminal and might make statements that are truthful or false.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [5].\nMy Role Is Unknown."

This is a surprising statement, as I previously suspected Player 4 might be an Investigator or a Rumormonger. However, as an Investigator, I should provide consistent information. Given that I previously suspected Player 4, this statement could be an attempt to mislead or deflect suspicion.\n- Player 2 says Player 3 is the criminal. This statement is suspicious, given that Player 2 is likely a Rumormonger and may provide incorrect information.\n- Player 3 says Player 6 is not the criminal, which is consistent with my previous assessment of Player 3's statement in Round 1.\n- Player 4 says Player 2 is not the criminal, which is an interesting statement. If Player 4 were a Rumormonger, they might make a statement that's incorrect, but in this case, it's consistent with my previous assessment of Player 2's role.\n- Player 5 says Player 1 is not the criminal, which is consistent with my role as an Investigator. However, given that Player 5 is likely a Lunatic, this statement might be misleading.\n- Player 6 says Player 2 is not the criminal, which could be true or false. Given that Player 6 is likely a Rumormonger, this statement might be incorrect.\n\nConsidering the statements, I notice that Player 1's statement in Round 3 is suspicious, as it points to Player 4 as the criminal. However, given that Player 1 is an Investigator, I should be cautious about making claims. I also notice that Player 2's statement in Round 3 is suspicious, given that they are likely a Rumormonger.\n\nGiven the information, I'm inclined to think that Player 2 or Player 4 might be the criminal. However, I need to consider the possibility of a Lunatic or Rumormonger among the players.\n\nAfter re-evaluating the statements, I'm going to take a more confident stance.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [2].\nMy Role Is Investigator."

          "response": "Given the rules and the statements from Round 1, I'll analyze the information step by step.\n\n1. **Player 1's Statement**: Since I'm the one making this statement, I'm a Criminal, and I'm claiming Player 2 is not the Criminal. This statement is truthful from my perspective, as I am a Criminal and I'm trying to mislead others about Player 2's role.\n\n2. **Player 2's Statement**: Player 2 says I (Player 1) am not the Criminal. Given that I am a Criminal, this statement is false. Player 2 is either a Rumormonger (who believes they are an Investigator but provides incorrect information) or a Lunatic (who believes they are a Criminal but may provide truthful or false information). However, the fact that Player 2 claims I am not the Criminal suggests they might be trying to mislead, but since they're not claiming Player 1 is the Criminal, it's less clear.\n\n3. **Player 3's Statement**: Player 3 says I (Player 1) am not the Criminal. Similar to Player 2, Player 3 is also making a statement that I am not the Criminal. Given my role as a Criminal, this statement is false. Player 3 could be a Rumormonger or a Lunatic, but their statement aligns with Player 2's, suggesting a pattern of misinformation.\n\n4. **Player 4's Statement**: Player 4 says Player 5 is the Criminal. Since I'm a Criminal, and Player 4 is making a statement that could potentially be true or false, I need to consider other roles. If Player 4 were an Investigator, they would always tell the truth, making Player 5 the Criminal. However, since Player 4 could be a Rumormonger or a Lunatic, this statement might be misleading.\n\n5. **Player 5's Statement**: Player 5 says Player 2 is the Criminal. This statement could be true or false, depending on Player 5's role. If Player 5 were an Investigator, they would always tell the truth, making Player 2 the Criminal. However, since Player 5 could be a Rumormonger or a Lunatic, this statement is likely false.\n\n6. **Player 6's Statement**: Player 6 says Player 3 is the Criminal. This statement could be true or false, depending on Player 6's role. If Player 6 were an Investigator, they would always tell the truth, making Player 3 the Criminal. However, since Player 6 could be a Rumormonger or a Lunatic, this statement is likely false.\n\n**Analysis**: Considering the statements, I see a pattern where Players 2 and 3 are making statements that I am not the Criminal. This pattern suggests they might be trying to mislead, possibly as Rumormongers or Lunatics. Player 4's statement about Player 5 being the Criminal is potentially true if Player 4 were an Investigator, but it could also be a misleading statement from a Rumormonger or a Lunatic. Player 5's statement about Player 2 being the Criminal is likely false, and Player 6's statement about Player 3 being the Criminal is also likely false.\n\n**Conclusion**: Given the analysis, I'm going to make an educated guess about the roles and the Criminal.\n\n**Final Judgment:**\nFinal Criminal Is Player 4.\nMy Role Is Unknown.\n\nThis conclusion is based on the assumption that Player 4's statement about Player 5 being the Criminal could be true if Player 4 were an Investigator, which would make Player 4 the Investigator. However, since I'm a Criminal and I'm trying to mislead, I might be wrong about Player 4's role. The uncertainty about the roles and the statements makes it difficult to determine my own role with confidence."
