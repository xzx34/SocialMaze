Therefore, Player 6 is not the criminal.\n2. **Player 2 says Player 5 is not the criminal.**\n3. **Player 3 says Player 5 is not the criminal.**\n4. **Player 4 says Player 2 is the criminal.**\n5. **Player 5 says Player 3 is not the criminal.**\n6. **Player 6 says Player 5 is the criminal.**\n\n### Round 2 Recap:\n1. **Player 1 (You) says Player 4 is not the criminal.**\n   - As an Investigator, this statement is truthful. Therefore, Player 4 is not the criminal.\n2. **Player 2 says Player 3 is not the criminal.**\n3. **Player 3 says Player 6 is not the criminal.**\n   - This statement is consistent with your statement from Round 1, which is truthful. Therefore, Player 3 is likely an Investigator.\n4. **Player 4 says Player 5 is not the criminal.**\n5. **Player 5 says Player 2 is the criminal.**\n6. **Player 6 says Player 1 is not the criminal.**\n   - Since Player 6 is not the criminal, this statement is true. Therefore, Player 6 is not the criminal, and this statement is consistent with your role as an Investigator.\n\n### Round 3 Statements:\n1. **Player 1 (You) says Player 3 is not the criminal.**\n   - As an Investigator, this statement is truthful. Therefore, Player 3 is not the criminal.\n2. **Player 2 says Player 6 is not the criminal.**\n   - This is consistent with your statement from Round 1. Therefore, Player 2 could be an Investigator or Lunatic.\n3. **Player 3 says Player 4 is not the criminal.**\n   - This is consistent with your statement from Round 2. Therefore, Player 3 is likely an Investigator.\n4. **Player 4 says Player 1 is not the criminal.**\n   - This is consistent with your role as an Investigator. Therefore, Player 4 could be an Investigator or Lunatic.\n5. **Player 5 says Player 2 is the criminal.**\n   - This is consistent with their statement from Round 2. Therefore, Player 5 could be the Criminal or Lunatic.\n6. **Player 6 says Player 3 is the criminal.**\n   - Since Player 6 is not the criminal and Player 3 is not the criminal, this statement is false. Therefore, Player 6 could be the Criminal or Lunatic.\n\n### Updated Analysis:\n- **Player 6 is not the criminal.**\n- **Player 4 is not the criminal.**\n- **Player 3 is not the criminal.**\n- **Player 2 and Player 5 are the most likely candidates for the Criminal.**\n  - **Player 2 says Player 3 is not the criminal and Player 5 is not the criminal.**\n  - **Player 5 says Player 2 is the criminal.**\n\nGiven the statements:\n- Player 2 and Player 5 are contradicting each other.\n- If Player 2 is the Criminal, they are lying about Player 5.\n- If Player 5 is the Criminal, they are lying about Player 2.\n\n### Final Judgment for Round 3:\n- **Player 5 is the most likely Criminal because they are directly accusing Player 2, and Player 2 is not contradicting this strongly.**\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 5.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

If you are the Criminal, your statement about Player 3 could be a lie to mislead others.\n- **Player 2**: Claims Player 4 is not the criminal. If Player 2 is an Investigator, this statement is true. If Player 2 is a Criminal or Lunatic, they could be lying.\n- **Player 3**: Claims Player 5 is not the criminal. If Player 3 is an Investigator, this statement is true. If Player 3 is a Criminal or Lunatic, they could be lying.\n- **Player 4**: Claims Player 6 is the criminal. If Player 4 is an Investigator, this statement is true. If Player 4 is a Criminal or Lunatic, they could be lying.\n- **Player 5**: Claims Player 3 is not the criminal. If Player 5 is an Investigator, this statement is true. If Player 5 is a Criminal or Lunatic, they could be lying.\n- **Player 6**: Claims Player 3 is not the criminal. If Player 6 is an Investigator, this statement is true. If Player 6 is a Criminal or Lunatic, they could be lying.\n\n### Possible Scenarios:\n1. **You are the Criminal**: Players 5 and 6 both claim Player 3 is not the criminal, which aligns with your statement from Round 1. Player 3 also claims Player 5 is not the criminal, which is consistent with the other statements. Player 4 claims Player 6 is the criminal, which could be a lie if Player 4 is a Criminal or Lunatic.\n2. **Player 3 is the Criminal**: This would mean Player 1 (You) is the Criminal, which is consistent with your role. Players 5 and 6 would be Investigators, making their statements about Player 3 true. Player 4 would be the Lunatic or a Criminal, making their statement about Player 6 false.\n3. **Player 4 is the Criminal**: This would mean Player 2 is an Investigator, making their statement about Player 4 true. Player 3, 5, and 6 would be Investigators, making their statements about Player 5 and 3 true. Player 4 would be the Lunatic or a Criminal, making their statement about Player 6 false.\n4. **Player 6 is the Criminal**: This would mean Player 4 is an Investigator, making their statement about Player 6 true. Player 2, 3, 5, and 6 would be Investigators, making their statements about Player 4, 5, and 3 true. Player 6 would be the Lunatic or a Criminal, making their statement about Player 3 false.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the statements and the roles, the most consistent scenario is that you are the Criminal. Players 5 and 6 are likely Investigators, making their statements about Player 3 true. Player 4 is likely the Lunatic or a Criminal, making their statement about Player 6 false.\n\n### Final Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

This statement could be true or false.\n\n2. **Player 2 says Player 4 is not the criminal.**\n   - If Player 2 is an Investigator, this statement is true.\n   - If Player 2 is a Criminal, this statement could be true or false.\n   - If Player 2 is a Lunatic, this statement could be true or false.\n\n3. **Player 3 says Player 4 is not the criminal.**\n   - If Player 3 is an Investigator, this statement is true.\n   - If Player 3 is a Criminal, this statement could be true or false.\n   - If Player 3 is a Lunatic, this statement could be true or false.\n\n4. **Player 4 says Player 5 is not the criminal.**\n   - If Player 4 is an Investigator, this statement is true.\n   - If Player 4 is a Criminal, this statement could be true or false.\n   - If Player 4 is a Lunatic, this statement could be true or false.\n\n5. **Player 5 says Player 6 is not the criminal.**\n   - If Player 5 is an Investigator, this statement is true.\n   - If Player 5 is a Criminal, this statement could be true or false.\n   - If Player 5 is a Lunatic, this statement could be true or false.\n\n6. **Player 6 says Player 2 is not the criminal.**\n   - If Player 6 is an Investigator, this statement is true.\n   - If Player 6 is a Criminal, this statement could be true or false.\n   - If Player 6 is a Lunatic, this statement could be true or false.\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Player 4 is the criminal:**\n  - Player 1 says Player 4 is the criminal.\n  - Player 2 and Player 3 say Player 4 is not the criminal.\n  - This creates a conflict.

If Player 6 is the Criminal or Lunatic, they would likely lie, making their statement false.\n- Player 5 is the only one who claims Player 3 is the criminal, which is a conflicting statement.\n- Player 4's statement that Player 1 is not the criminal aligns with your role as an Investigator and your statement about Player 6.\n\n### Conclusion\n- **Player 1 (You)**: Investigator (confirmed by your truthful statement).\n- **Player 6**: Not the criminal (confirmed by multiple Investigator statements).\n- **Player 5**: Most likely the Criminal or Lunatic, as they are the only one claiming someone else is the criminal.\n- **Player 3**: Not the criminal (if Player 5 is the Criminal, their statement would be a lie).\n\n### Final Judgment (After Round 1)\nFinal Criminal Is Player 5.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

If both are Investigators, this is likely true.\n- **Player 4 is not the criminal:** This statement is supported by two players (Player 3 and Player 6). If both are Investigators, this is likely true.\n- **Player 5 is the criminal:** This statement is supported by two players (Player 1 and Player 2). If both are Investigators, this is likely true, but as the Criminal, my statement is unreliable.\n- **Player 2 is the criminal:** This statement is supported by one player (Player 4). If Player 4 is an Investigator, this is likely true.\n\n### Possible Scenarios\n1. **Player 2 is the Criminal:**\n   - If Player 2 is the Criminal, then Player 4 is an Investigator, and their statement about Player 2 being the criminal is true.\n   - Player 3 and Player 6 are likely Investigators, and their statements about Player 3 and Player 4 being not the criminal are true.\n   - Player 5 is likely an Investigator, and their statement about Player 3 being not the criminal is true.\n   - This fits the role distribution well.\n\n2. **Player 5 is the Criminal:**\n   - If Player 5 is the Criminal, then Player 1 and Player 2 are either Investigators or the Lunatic.\n   - Player 3 and Player 6 are likely Investigators, and their statements about Player 3 and Player 4 being not the criminal are true.\n   - Player 4 is likely an Investigator, and their statement about Player 2 being the criminal is true.\n   - This scenario is also plausible, but it involves more complex role assignments.\n\n3. **Player 1 is the Criminal:**\n   - If Player 1 is the Criminal, then the statement from Player 2 is true.\n   - This fits my role as the Criminal, but it doesn't align well with the other statements made by the other players.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the updated round of statements, the most likely scenario is that **Player 2 is the Criminal**. This fits the role distribution and the statements made by the other players, especially the consistent statements from multiple players about Player 2 being the criminal.\n\n### Final Judgment\nFinal Criminal Is Player 2.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

If Player 2 is an Investigator, this is true. If Player 2 is a Criminal or Lunatic, it could be a lie.\n- **Player 3 says Player 4 is not the criminal.**\n  - This is a new statement. If Player 3 is an Investigator, this is true. If Player 3 is a Criminal or Lunatic, it could be a lie.\n- **Player 4 says Player 3 is not the criminal.**\n  - This is a new statement. If Player 4 is an Investigator, this is true. If Player 4 is a Criminal or Lunatic, it could be a lie.\n- **Player 5 says Player 1 is the criminal.**\n  - This is the same statement as in Round 1 and Round 2. If Player 5 is an Investigator, this is true. If Player 5 is a Criminal or Lunatic, it could be a lie.\n- **Player 6 says Player 5 is not the criminal.**\n  - This is the same statement as in Round 1. If Player 6 is an Investigator, this is true. If Player 6 is a Criminal or Lunatic, it could be a lie.\n\n### Conflicting Statements:\n- **Player 3 says Player 1 is the criminal (Round 1) and Player 4 is not the criminal (Round 3).**\n  - If Player 3 is an Investigator, both statements should be true, which is possible if Player 1 is the Criminal and Player 4 is not the Criminal.\n- **Player 5 says Player 3 is not the criminal (Round 1) and Player 1 is the criminal (Round 2 and Round 3).**\n  - If Player 5 is an Investigator, both statements should be true, which is possible if Player 1 is the Criminal and Player 3 is not the Criminal.\n- **Player 6 says Player 5 is not the criminal (Round 1 and Round 3).**\n  - If Player 6 is an Investigator, this is true, which means Player 5 is not the Criminal.\n\n### Consistent Statements:\n- **Player 2 says Player 6 is not the criminal (Round 1 and Round 2) and Player 6 is the criminal (Round 3).**\n  - This is a contradiction. Player 2 cannot be an Investigator. Player 2 is either a Criminal or a Lunatic.\n- **Player 4 says Player 2 is not the criminal (Round 1 and Round 2) and Player 3 is not the criminal (Round 3).**\n  - If Player 4 is an Investigator, both statements should be true, which is possible if Player 2 and Player 3 are not the Criminal.\n- **Player 5 says Player 1 is the criminal (Round 1, Round 2, and Round 3).**\n  - If Player 5 is an Investigator, this is true, which means Player 1 is the Criminal.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- **Player 3 and Player 5 both point to Player 1 as the Criminal.**\n  - If both are Investigators, this is consistent with the information that I am the Criminal.\n- **Player 4's statements are consistent with Player 2 and Player 3 not being the Criminal.**\n  - If Player 4 is an Investigator, Player 2 and Player 3 are not the Criminal.\n- **Player 2's contradictory statements indicate that Player 2 is not an Investigator.**\n  - Player 2 is either a Criminal or a Lunatic.\n\n### Final Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

Therefore, Player 4 is not the criminal.\n\n2. **Player 2 says Player 6 is the criminal.**\n   - This statement could be true or false depending on Player 2's role. If Player 2 is an Investigator, this is true. If Player 2 is the Criminal or Lunatic, this could be false.\n\n3. **Player 3 says Player 1 is not the criminal.**\n   - This statement could be true or false depending on Player 3's role. If Player 3 is an Investigator, this is true. If Player 3 is the Criminal or Lunatic, this could be false.\n\n4. **Player 4 says Player 3 is not the criminal.**\n   - This statement could be true or false depending on Player 4's role. If Player 4 is an Investigator, this is true. If Player 4 is the Criminal or Lunatic, this could be false.\n\n5. **Player 5 says Player 2 is the criminal.**\n   - This statement could be true or false depending on Player 5's role. If Player 5 is an Investigator, this is true. If Player 5 is the Criminal or Lunatic, this could be false.\n\n6. **Player 6 says Player 2 is not the criminal.**\n   - This statement could be true or false depending on Player 6's role. If Player 6 is an Investigator, this is true. If Player 6 is the Criminal or Lunatic, this could be false.\n\n### Updated Deductions\n\n- **Player 4 is not the criminal** (confirmed by Player 1, an Investigator in Round 3).\n- **Player 5 is not the criminal** (confirmed by Player 1, an Investigator in Round 1).\n- **Player 6 is not the criminal** (confirmed by Player 1, an Investigator in Round 2).\n\nThis leaves Player 2 and Player 3 as the potential candidates for the Criminal.\n\n- **Player 3 says Player 2 is the criminal.**\n- **Player 4 says Player 2 is the criminal.**\n- **Player 5 says Player 2 is the criminal.**\n\nMultiple players (3, 4, 5) are pointing to Player 2 as the criminal. If these players are Investigators, their statements are true. If one of them is the Criminal or Lunatic, they are trying to mislead. However, given the consistency of the statements and the lack of support for Player 3 being the criminal, it is more likely that Player 2 is the Criminal.\n\n- **Player 6 says Player 2 is not the criminal.**\n  - This statement could be true or false depending on Player 6's role. If Player 6 is an Investigator, this is true. If Player 6 is the Criminal or Lunatic, this could be false. However, since multiple other players are pointing to Player 2, it is less likely that Player 6 is an Investigator.\n\n### Final Judgment for Round 3\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 2.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

This suggests that Player 2 and Player 6 could be Investigators, as their statements align with the idea that they are providing truthful information.\n\n### Possible Scenarios:\n1. **Player 3 is the Criminal or Lunatic:** If Player 3 is the Criminal or Lunatic, their statement about Player 4 being the criminal could be false.\n2. **Player 4 is the Criminal:** If Player 4 is the Criminal, their statement about Player 5 not being the criminal could be false.\n3. **Player 5 is the Criminal:** If Player 5 is the Criminal, their statement about Player 4 not being the criminal could be false.\n4. **Player 6 is the Criminal:** If Player 6 is the Criminal, their statement about Player 2 not being the criminal could be false.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- **Player 3's statement is the most suspicious** because it directly contradicts the statements of Player 4 and Player 5.\n- **Player 4 and Player 5's statements align with each other**, suggesting they might be Investigators or the Lunatic.\n\n### Final Judgment after Round 1:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 3.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

If Player 6 is the Criminal or Lunatic, this statement can be a lie.\n\n### Updated Analysis:\n\n1. **Player 1 (You) says Player 3 is not the criminal.**\n   - If you are telling the truth, Player 3 is not the criminal. If you are lying, Player 3 is the criminal.\n\n2. **Player 2 says Player 3 is not the criminal.**\n   - If Player 2 is an Investigator, this statement is true. If Player 2 is the Criminal or Lunatic, this statement can be a lie.\n\n3. **Player 3 says Player 4 is not the criminal.**\n   - If Player 3 is an Investigator, this statement is true. If Player 3 is the Criminal or Lunatic, this statement can be a lie.\n\n4. **Player 4 says Player 6 is not the criminal.**\n   - If Player 4 is an Investigator, this statement is true. If Player 4 is the Criminal or Lunatic, this statement can be a lie.\n\n5. **Player 5 says Player 6 is not the criminal.**\n   - If Player 5 is an Investigator, this statement is true. If Player 5 is the Criminal or Lunatic, this statement can be a lie.\n\n6. **Player 6 says Player 1 is the criminal.**\n   - If Player 6 is an Investigator, this statement is true. If Player 6 is the Criminal or Lunatic, this statement can be a lie.\n\n### Possible Scenarios:\n\n1. **If Player 1 (You) is the Criminal:**\n   - Player 3 is not the criminal (as you are telling the truth or lying).\n   - Player 2, Player 4, Player 5, and Player 6 are likely Investigators.\n   - Player 6's statement about Player 1 being the criminal is true, which is consistent with Player 6 being an Investigator.\n\n2. **If Player 3 is the Criminal:**\n   - Player 1 (You) is lying, which is consistent with being the Criminal.\n   - Player 2, Player 4, and Player 5 are likely Investigators.\n   - Player 6's statement about Player 1 being the criminal can be a lie, which is consistent with Player 6 being the Lunatic.\n\n3. **If Player 6 is the Criminal:**\n   - Player 4 and Player 5 are likely Investigators (since their statements about Player 6 not being the criminal are true).\n   - Player 2 and Player 3 are likely Investigators (since their statements about Player 3 not being the criminal are true).\n   - Player 6's statement about Player 1 being the criminal is a lie, which is consistent with Player 6 being the Criminal.\n   - Player 1 (You) is likely the Lunatic.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nGiven the statements, the most consistent scenario is that Player 1 (You) is the Criminal. This is because multiple players (Player 2, Player 4, Player 5, and Player 6) are providing statements that are consistent with you being the Criminal, and if they are Investigators, their statements are true. Player 6's statement about Player 1 being the criminal is particularly strong evidence.\n\n### Final Judgment:\n\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

This suggests Player 3 could be the Criminal or Lunatic.\n- **Player 4:** Claims Player 1 is not the criminal in Round 3, which is true. Also, claims Player 2 is not the criminal in Round 2, which is consistent with being an Investigator.\n- **Player 5:** Claims Player 4 is not the criminal in Round 2 and Player 6 is not the criminal in Round 3.

However, since Player 6 is the Criminal, this statement is likely false, suggesting Player 5 is not the Criminal.\n\n### Updated Analysis:\n- **Player 6 is the Criminal:**\n  - Player 1 (Investigator) says Player 6 is the criminal.\n  - Player 4 (likely an Investigator) says Player 6 is the criminal.\n  - Player 5 (likely an Investigator) says Player 6 is the criminal.\n  - Player 6's statement that Player 5 is the criminal is false, which aligns with Player 6 being the Criminal.\n\n- **Player 2 is likely a Lunatic:**\n  - Player 2's statement that Player 5 is not the criminal could be true or false, and it aligns with a Lunatic's behavior.\n\n- **Player 3 is likely an Investigator:**\n  - Player 3's statement that Player 5 is not the criminal is true, which aligns with Player 3 being an Investigator.\n\n- **Player 4 is likely an Investigator:**\n  - Player 4's statement that Player 6 is the criminal is true, which aligns with Player 4 being an Investigator.\n\n- **Player 5 is likely an Investigator:**\n  - Player 5's statement that Player 2 is not the criminal is true, which aligns with Player 5 being an Investigator.\n\n- **Player 1 is an Investigator:**\n  - Player 1's statement that Player 3 is not the criminal is true, which aligns with Player 1 being an Investigator.\n\n### Final Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 6.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

However, if Player 5 is the Criminal, then Player 3 is not the Criminal.\n\n- **Player 3 says Player 2 is not the criminal.**\n  - If Player 2 is the Criminal, then Player 3 is lying, which means Player 3 could be the Lunatic or the Criminal.\n\n- **Player 4 says Player 6 is not the criminal.**\n  - If Player 6 is the Criminal, then Player 4 is lying, which means Player 4 could be the Lunatic or the Criminal.\n\n### Possible Scenarios\n\n1. **If Player 5 is the Criminal:**\n   - Player 5's statement is false, so Player 3 is not the Criminal.\n   - Player 2 and Player 6 are both telling the truth, so they are both Investigators.\n   - Player 3 and Player 4 must be the remaining Investigator and the Lunatic.\n   - This scenario is consistent with the statements.\n\n2. **If Player 3 is the Criminal:**\n   - Player 5's statement is true, so Player 5 is an Investigator.\n   - Player 2 and Player 6 are both telling the truth, which means Player 5 is not the Criminal.\n   - This scenario is inconsistent because it would mean Player 5 is both the Criminal and an Investigator.\n\n3. **If Player 2 is the Criminal:**\n   - Player 3's statement is false, so Player 3 is the Lunatic.\n   - Player 5's statement is false, so Player 5 is an Investigator.\n   - Player 6's statement is true, so Player 6 is an Investigator.\n   - Player 4's statement is true, so Player 4 is an Investigator.\n   - This scenario is consistent with the statements.\n\n4. **If Player 6 is the Criminal:**\n   - Player 4's statement is false, so Player 4 is the Lunatic.\n   - Player 5's statement is false, so Player 5 is an Investigator.\n   - Player 2's statement is true, so Player 2 is an Investigator.\n   - Player 3's statement is true, so Player 3 is an Investigator.\n   - This scenario is consistent with the statements.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the statements and the consistency of the scenarios:\n\n- **Player 5 is the most likely to be the Criminal.**\n- **Player 3 is the most likely to be the Lunatic.**\n- **Players 2, 4, and 6 are likely to be Investigators.**\n\n### Final Judgment (After Round 1)\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 5.\nMy Role Is Criminal."
