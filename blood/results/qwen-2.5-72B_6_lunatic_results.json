Player 6 says Player 2 is not the criminal.\n\n#### Updated Observations:\n- **Player 1** (Criminal): Claims Player 6 is the criminal. As a Criminal, this could be a lie to mislead or a truth to create confusion.\n- **Player 2**: Claims Player 5 is not the criminal. This could be true if Player 2 is an Investigator or a lie if Player 2 is the Lunatic or the Criminal.\n- **Player 3**: Claims Player 5 is not the criminal. This could be true if Player 3 is an Investigator or a lie if Player 3 is the Lunatic or the Criminal.\n- **Player 4**: Claims Player 2 is the criminal. This could be true if Player 4 is an Investigator or a lie if Player 4 is the Lunatic or the Criminal.\n- **Player 5**: Claims Player 2 is not the criminal.

This could be true if they are Investigators or a lie if one of them is the Lunatic or the Criminal.\n- **Player 4**: Claims Player 2 is the criminal. This could be true if Player 4 is an Investigator or a lie if Player 4 is the Lunatic or the Criminal.\n- **Player 5** and **Player 6** both claim Player 2 is not the criminal. This could be true if they are Investigators or a lie if one of them is the Lunatic or the Criminal.\n\n### Final Judgment for Round 3:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 2.\nMy Role Is Criminal.\n\n### Reasoning:\n- **Player 1** (Criminal): My claim that Player 6 is the criminal is likely a lie to mislead.\n- **Player 2** and **Player 3** both claim Player 5 is not the criminal, which suggests they might be Investigators.\n- **Player 4** claims Player 2 is the criminal, which is a strong indication if Player 4 is an Investigator.\n- **Player 5** and **Player 6** both claim Player 2 is not the criminal, which could be true if they are Investigators or a lie if one of them is the Lunatic.\n- **Player 4**'s consistent claim that Player 2 is the criminal, combined with the majority of players (Player 5 and Player 6) claiming Player 2 is not the criminal, suggests that Player 2 is the most likely candidate for the criminal. This is because if Player 2 were not the criminal, it would be unlikely for an Investigator to falsely accuse them.\n\nThis is my final judgment based on the statements from all three rounds."

If both are telling the truth, Player 3 is not the criminal.\n- Player 2 claims Player 3 is the criminal, which conflicts with the statements from Player 3 and Player 4. This suggests Player 2 might be the Criminal or the Lunatic.\n- Player 6 claims Player 2 is not the criminal, which aligns with Player 3 and Player 4's statements. This suggests Player 6 might be an Investigator.\n- Player 5 claims Player 6 is not the criminal, which also aligns with the possibility that Player 6 is an Investigator.\n\nGiven the conflicting statements, the most likely candidate for the Criminal is Player 2, as their statement is the only one that directly conflicts with the majority.\n\n### Final Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 2.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

This statement could be either true or false.\n\n2. **Player 2 says Player 3 is not the criminal.**\n   - If Player 2 is an Investigator, this statement is true.\n   - If Player 2 is the Lunatic or another Criminal, this statement could be either true or false.\n\n3. **Player 3 says Player 4 is the criminal.**\n   - If Player 3 is an Investigator, this statement is true.\n   - If Player 3 is the Lunatic or another Criminal, this statement could be either true or false.\n\n4. **Player 4 says Player 3 is not the criminal.**\n   - If Player 4 is an Investigator, this statement is true.\n   - If Player 4 is the Lunatic or another Criminal, this statement could be either true or false.\n\n5. **Player 5 says Player 3 is not the criminal.**\n   - If Player 5 is an Investigator, this statement is true.\n   - If Player 5 is the Lunatic or another Criminal, this statement could be either true or false.\n\n6. **Player 6 says Player 3 is not the criminal.**\n   - If Player 6 is an Investigator, this statement is true.\n   - If Player 6 is the Lunatic or another Criminal, this statement could be either true or false.\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Player 1 (me) says Player 3 is the criminal.**\n  - This contradicts my statement in Round 1 that Player 3 is not the criminal. As a Criminal, I can lie or tell the truth, so this statement could be false.\n\n- **Player 2, Player 4, Player 5, and Player 6 all say Player 3 is not the criminal.**\n  - If all four of these players are Investigators, Player 3 is not the criminal.\n  - If one or more of them is the Lunatic or another Criminal, their statements could be false.\n\n- **Player 3 says Player 4 is the criminal.**\n  - This contradicts Player 4's statement that Player 3 is not the criminal.\n  - If Player 3 is an Investigator, Player 4 is the criminal.\n  - If Player 3 is the Lunatic or another Criminal, their statement could be false.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- **Player 3 is a key figure in the statements:**\n  - Four players (Player 2, Player 4, Player 5, and Player 6) all say Player 3 is not the criminal.\n  - Player 3 says Player 4 is the criminal, which conflicts with Player 4's statement that Player 3 is not the criminal.\n- **If Player 2, Player 4, Player 5, and Player 6 are all Investigators, Player 3 is not the criminal.**\n- **Player 4 and Player 5 are still making conflicting statements about each other, which suggests one of them is the Criminal or the Lunatic.**\n\nGiven the information so far, the most likely scenario is that Player 3 is not the criminal, and Player 4 is the Criminal. Player 5 is likely the Lunatic, as they are making a conflicting statement about Player 4.\n\n### Final Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 4.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

The statements from Player 2, Player 3, and Player 5 align with them being Investigators, and your statement and Player 6's statement also align with you both being Investigators.\n\n### Final Judgment\n\nFinal Criminal Is Player 4.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

Your statements in both rounds are consistent with being the Criminal (accusing Player 3 in Round 1 and deflecting suspicion from Player 2 in Round 2).\n\n- **Player 2:** Three players (Player 1, Player 4, and Player 6) say Player 2 is not the criminal, which aligns with them being Investigators. Player 2's statement about Player 4 not being the criminal is consistent with being an Investigator.\n\n- **Player 3:** Two players (Player 2 and Player 6) say Player 3 is not the criminal, while you (Player 1) say Player 3 is the criminal. Player 3's statement about Player 6 not being the criminal is consistent with being an Investigator.\n\n- **Player 4:** Two players (Player 1 and Player 6) say Player 2 is not the criminal, which aligns with them being Investigators. Player 4's statement about Player 2 not being the criminal is consistent with being an Investigator.\n\n- **Player 5:** Player 5 says Player 1 is the criminal, which aligns with them being an Investigator.

Player 6's statement about Player 2 not being the criminal is consistent with being an Investigator.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- **Player 3** is the most likely candidate for the Criminal, as you (Player 1) are the only one accusing them, and the other players are supporting the idea that Player 3 is not the Criminal.\n- **You (Player 1)** are likely the Criminal, as you are making statements that align with being the Criminal and deflecting suspicion from yourself.\n\n### Final Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 3.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

Player 4 could be an Investigator, the Criminal, or the Lunatic. If Player 4 is an Investigator, this statement is true.

Given that Player 4 was previously identified as an Investigator, this statement strengthens the likelihood that Player 2 is not the Criminal.\n\n5. **Player 5 says Player 1 is not the criminal.**\n   - Since you are an Investigator, this statement is true. If Player 5 were the Criminal, they might have an incentive to lie. However, this statement being true suggests that Player 5 might not be the Criminal. However, this is not definitive.\n\n6. **Player 6 says Player 3 is not the criminal.**\n   - Since Player 6 is not the criminal, this statement is likely true. Therefore, Player 3 is likely not the criminal.\n\n### Summary of Analysis:\n- **Player 6 is not the criminal** (confirmed by multiple statements and your own truthful statement).\n- **Player 2 is likely not the criminal** (supported by statements from Players 3 and 4, who are likely Investigators).\n- **Player 3 is likely not the criminal** (supported by Player 6, who is not the criminal).\n- **Player 4 is likely an Investigator** (supported by their statement aligning with Player 3's statement).\n- **Player 5 is still a strong candidate for the Criminal** (their statement about Player 1 being not the criminal is true, but they could be lying about other players to mislead).\n\n### Final Judgment for Round 3:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 5.\nMy Role Is Investigator."
