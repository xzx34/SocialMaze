Thus, there is strong evidence pointing towards Player 4 being the criminal.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 4.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

However, their statements may also be part of a strategy to mislead, as both players have been given the freedom to provide either truthful or false statements.\n\nConsidering the overall statements from all three rounds:\n\n- You (Player 1) have consistently claimed others are the Criminal (specifically Player 6 in Round 3), which aligns with your role as the Criminal trying to deflect suspicion.\n- Players 2 and 3 seem to protect Player 5, while Player 4 defends Player 3, creating a web of mutual accusations that does not directly implicate anyone else.\n- Player 5 and Player 6 both accusing you suggests they could be Investigators or one of them could be a Rumormonger or a Lunatic. However, since you know your own role, the consistency of their accusations against you is notable but does not provide definitive proof.\n\nGiven this analysis, the statements mostly revolve around your role as the Criminal, with Players 5 and 6 being very vocal about it while others are defending different players.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

However, Player 2 could also be lying if they are the criminal or mistaken if they are a Rumormonger.\n\n3. **Player 3**: Says Player 5 is not the criminal.

Player 6's statement about Player 4 being innocent does not contradict any known truths, but given their previous false accusation against me, it remains suspect.\n\nOverall, the consistent accusations against Player 6 from multiple players (Players 3 and 5) combined with their past misleading statement about me continue to support the conclusion that Player 6 is indeed the Criminal. Player 4's statement does not provide any new allegations against Player 6 or anyone else.\n\nThus, after reviewing all statements across the rounds, I am confident in my judgment.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 6.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

Therefore, your statement that Player 2 is not the criminal is intended to mislead, as you are trying to divert suspicion away from yourself.\n- Player 2's statement that Player 1 (you) is the criminal is true because you indeed are the Criminal. This suggests Player 2 is either an Investigator or a Rumormonger who is making a correct statement unknowingly.\n- Players 3, 4, and 5 all claim that Player 6 is not the criminal.

Thus, your statement that Player 6 is not the criminal is intended to mislead and redirect suspicion away from yourself.\n- Player 2 also claims Player 6 is not the criminal.

If Player 4 is truthful, this further supports Player 2\u2019s potential role as an Investigator.\n- Players 5 and 6 both claim Player 4 is not the criminal. Since multiple players are stating the same thing about Player 4, it strongly suggests that Player 4 is likely innocent.\n\nNow let\u2019s summarize:\n- Player 1 (you) are confirmed as the Criminal.\n- Player 2 is likely an Investigator as they correctly identify Player 6 as not the criminal.\n- Players 3, 4, and 5 are also likely Investigators given their consistent statements about Player 4 and Player 6 being innocent.\n\nFrom the statements across all rounds:\n1.

(This could be true or false depending on Player 6's role.)\n\nFrom this analysis:\n- You confirmed Player 5 is innocent.\n- Players 3 and 4 both affirm your innocence as Player 1, which is consistent.\n- Player 6's statement that Player 2 is the criminal provides a new angle. If Player 6 is the Criminal, they may be trying to deflect suspicion onto Player 2.\n- The statements from Players 2, 4, and 5 do not give any solid evidence against Player 2 but do not contradict your findings either.\n\nConsidering previous rounds:\n- In Round 1, Player 2 was a suspect based on Player 3's accusation.\n- In Round 2, Player 2 defended Player 3, which was a suspect at that point.\n- Now, Player 6 places the blame on Player 2, which could either indicate that Player 6 is attempting to mislead or that Player 2 is indeed the criminal.\n\nThe evidence is still inconclusive, but the pattern of Player 6's behavior in Round 3\u2014accusing Player 2\u2014combined with the statements from previous rounds, suggests that Player 2 is a consistent suspect, but Player 6 may also be trying to mislead.\n\nGiven the cumulative statements and the need to decide based on the last round's assertions, I will conclude.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 2.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

Player 5 claims that Player 2 is not the criminal. This statement could also be true or false.\n6. Player 6 states that Player 4 is the criminal. This statement could be true or false.\n\nNow analyzing the statements:\n- My assertion that Player 4 is the criminal can be either true or false, but it carries weight due to my role as an Investigator.\n- Player 2\u2019s statement that I am not the criminal is true and helps confirm my role.\n- Players 3 and 4's statements about Player 6 being innocent conflict, so we cannot determine Player 6's status based on these conflicting statements.\n- Player 5's statement about Player 2 being innocent does not provide new information, especially since Player 2 has been a suspect in past rounds.\n- Player 6's statement that Player 4 is the criminal directly conflicts with my statement, which means one of us must be lying.\n\nConsidering the overall situation:\n- I have stated that Player 4 is the criminal; if this is true, Player 6 is also telling the truth, which means Player 4 is indeed the criminal.\n- If I am mistaken about Player 4, then Player 6 must be the criminal. \n- Player 2 is confirmed innocent, as their statement about me is true.\n- Players 3 and 5 don't provide conclusive support for Player 6's innocence but do add to the complexity.\n\nBased on the conflict between my statement and Player 6's, and the patterns of suspicion that have developed through the rounds, I conclude that Player 4 is most likely the criminal.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 4.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

This statement could provide insight into Player 6's role, but we can't confirm it yet.\n\n4. Player 4 says Player 5 is not the criminal. This statement may be true or false, but Player 4's previous statements about you being the criminal were consistent and truthful.\n\n5. Player 5 says Player 3 is not the criminal. Again, this could be true or false, and we don\u2019t have enough information to confirm Player 5\u2019s role.\n\n6. Player 6 says Player 1 is the criminal. This statement is true, as you are indeed the criminal.\n\nFrom the analysis:\n- Players 3 and 6 continue to maintain that you are the criminal, which is consistent with your role.\n- Player 4 repeats the claim that Player 5 is not the criminal, aligning with Player 3's statement about Player 6.\n- Players 1 (you), 2, 5, and their statements do not provide new evidence to change your understanding of the game.\n\nSince Players 3 and 6 have been consistently identifying you correctly as the criminal, they are likely Investigators. Player 4's repetition also suggests they could be an Investigator or a Rumormonger. \n\nAt this point, the evidence strongly supports that you are the criminal and confirms that Players 3 and 6 are trustworthy in their statements.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

Given this consistency, we can conclude that the criminal remains Player 1 (yourself).\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

(This could be true or false.)\n\nFrom the analysis:\n- Player 1's statement is false, which aligns with you being the criminal.\n- Player 2 and Player 3 both state that Player 6 is not the criminal. If both statements are true, then Player 6 is definitely not the criminal.\n- Player 4 states that Player 2 is not the criminal. If true, this would imply Player 4 could be an Investigator as well.\n- Player 5 states that Player 3 is not the criminal, which could also be true or false.\n- Player 6 states that Player 4 is not the criminal.\n\nThe statements by Players 2 and 3 about Player 6 being innocent suggest they might be Investigators since their statements about Player 6 are consistent. However, we cannot definitively conclude the roles of Players 4, 5, and 6 based solely on the current information.\n\nGiven that you are Player 1 and know you are the criminal, you can reaffirm your status as the criminal and continue to suspect the roles of other players.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

From Round 3:\n   - Player 1 (Me) confirms Player 6 is not the criminal.\n   - Player 2's statement about Player 4 adds confusion, as does Player 4's statement about Player 3.\n   - Player 6 reiterating Player 4's innocence provides another layer of conflict.\n\nNow let's analyze the implications:\n- Players 1, 3, and 6 are ruled out as criminals from their truthful statements.\n- Player 4's claim about Player 3 being innocent could be true, but it doesn't help us narrow down the criminal definitively.\n- Player 5's statement about Player 2 being innocent conflicts with Player 2's potential implications about Player 4's innocence. \n\nGiven that:\n- Players 1 and 6 have consistently ruled out others as criminals.\n- Player 4's claim about Player 5 being the criminal in Round 2 remains unchallenged directly by other statements, particularly since Players 1 and 3 have maintained their innocence.\n\nThe strongest conclusion is that Player 5 remains the most likely criminal based on the consistent truthfulness of statements from Players 1, 3, and 6, and the conflicting claims around Player 5.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 5.\nMy Role Is Investigator."
