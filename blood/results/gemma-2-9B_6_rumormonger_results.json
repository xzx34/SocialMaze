This further strengthens the case against my accusation.\n* **Player 4:** Accused Player 5. This is a new development and throws suspicion on Player 5.\n* **Player 5:** Denied Player 4's accusation, stating they are NOT the criminal. \n* **Player 6:**  Also denied Player 4's accusation, stating Player 5 is NOT the criminal. This provides further support for Player 5's innocence.\n\n**Possible Scenarios:**\n\n* **Scenario 1:** I am the only Criminal and misidentified Player 6. The other players correctly identified me.\n* **Scenario 2:** Player 4 is the Criminal. Their accusations against Player 5 could be a distraction or a genuine attempt to frame them.\n* **Scenario 3:** There are two Criminals, with Player 4 being one and Player 6 being the other. This would explain the conflicting information and attempts to mislead.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nRound 3 significantly shifts the focus from me to Player 4.  While I can't entirely rule myself out, the evidence against my previous accusation and the new accusations against Player 4 make them a more likely suspect. \n\n**Final Judgment:**\n\nFinal Criminal Is Player [4].\nMy Role Is Criminal. \n\n\n"

This continues Player 5's pattern of contradicting my statements, but also creates a potential conflict with Player 6's accusation against Player 2.\n* **Player 6:** Accuses Player 2 of being the criminal. This is a direct accusation that throws a wrench into the potential alliance observed in the previous rounds.\n\n**Final Round Insights:**\n\n* **Player 6's accusation against Player 2 is pivotal.** It breaks the potential alliance and creates a new conflict. \n* **Player 1's accusation against Player 6 is supported by the overall pattern of deception.** Player 6 has been consistently contradicting other players' statements, making them a likely suspect.\n\n**Conclusion (Round 3):**\n\nBased on the information presented in Round 3, I believe Player 6 is the most likely Criminal. While Player 5 has been consistently misleading, Player 6's actions in this round point to a deliberate attempt to sow discord and manipulate the group.\n\n\n\n**Final Judgment:**\nFinal Criminal Is Player 6.\nMy Role Is Investigator. \n\n\n\n"

Considering Player 4's behavior in Round 2, this statement carries more weight.\n* **Player 5 stated Player 3 is not the criminal.** This statement, while seemingly inconsistent with Player 4's accusation, could be a tactic to mislead.\n* **Player 6 stated Player 2 is not the criminal.** This statement adds further complexity to the picture.\n\n\n**Potential Scenarios:**\n\n* **Scenario 1: Player 4 is the Investigator, and Player 5 is the Criminal.** Player 4 has been providing conflicting information throughout, but their statement in Round 3 aligns perfectly with my role as Investigator. \n* **Scenario 2: Player 5 is the Criminal and Player 4 is the Rumormonger.** This scenario explains the conflicting information from Player 4 in previous rounds.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the statements in Round 3, I believe Player 5 is the Criminal.
