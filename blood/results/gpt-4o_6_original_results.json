This contradicts Player 2's statement that aligns with my truth, suggesting Player 4 might be the Criminal or another role providing false information.\n\n5. **Player 5:** Says that I (Player 1) am not the criminal.

This is another statement that doesn't directly contradict any known truths but is unverified.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n- **Player 5:** Previously accused Player 2 in Round 1. So far, Player 5 only makes statements that align with known truths. Player 5's behavior is suspicious but could also be a strategy to blend in.\n\n- **Player 4:** Accuses Player 2, which contradicts the alignment between Player 2's statement and my truth.

This could indicate a collective effort to shift blame, or it might be genuine.\n- Player 6 accused Player 2 in round 1, and now Players 4 and 5 join this accusation, which adds weight to the suspicion against Player 2.\n- If Player 2 were the criminal, lying to protect Player 6 in Round 1 makes sense, but Player 6's consistent accusation of Player 2 remains significant.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Since Player 4 is confirmed not to be the criminal, and Player 3 has been consistently aligning with my statements, it's reasonable to consider Players 4, 5, and 6's accusations against Player 2 seriously.\n- Given multiple accusations against Player 2 and no one else being accused as strongly, Player 2 is the most likely candidate for the criminal role.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 2.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

Player 4's statement about Player 3 adds a layer of complexity but does not negate the consistency seen with Player 4 not being the criminal.\n\n**Updated Judgment:**\n\nSince I am told I am the Criminal and Player 6's statement aligns with this, my role remains as the Criminal unless further evidence suggests otherwise. \n\nFinal Judgment after Round 2:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

Player 6's previous accusation against me supports the notion that I am the Criminal.\n\nTherefore, my role remains consistent with the information I was provided at the start of the game.\n\nFinal Judgment after Round 3:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

This adds further consistency to the claim that Player 4 is not the criminal.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n- Players 2, 3, 5, and 6 all agree that Player 4 is not the criminal.\n- Player 4 claims Player 2 is not the criminal, consistent with past rounds where Player 2 and 6 were not accused.\n- None of the players other than myself have accused Player 5 or Player 4 as the criminal, and their statements consistently align with truthful information expected from Investigators.\n\nConsidering the consistent pattern of statements across all rounds, Players 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 have consistently supported each other's innocence and have not accused anyone but myself. This suggests they are all Investigators providing truthful information.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nGiven my position as the Criminal and the consistent nature of the other players' statements, they have successfully identified my role through their truthful deductions.\n\nFinal Judgment after Round 3:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

If they are the Criminal, they could be misleading.\n\nUsing Statements from Both Rounds:\n\n- My assertion about Player 5 being the Criminal is consistent with my role as an Investigator.\n- Player 2 consistently states Player 6 is not the criminal, which means they could be telling the truth or consistently misleading us if they are the Criminal.\n- Player 3 also consistently claims Player 6 is not the criminal, potentially indicating truth or deception if they are the Criminal.\n- Player 4's claim that Player 3 is not the criminal could be true if Player 4 is an Investigator, but false if Player 4 is misled.\n- Player 5's statement about Player 3 is likely false since I identified Player 5 as the Criminal.\n- Player 6 claims Player 2 is not the criminal, aligning with the possibility that Player 2 is an Investigator.\n\nConclusion:\n\nGiven my role as an Investigator and the consistency of statements, it seems most likely, based on the pattern of statements and my knowledge, that Player 5 is attempting to mislead us by falsely exonerating Player 3. Thus, Player 5 is the Criminal.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 5.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

If Player 2 were an Investigator, both rounds would be consistent, but this inconsistency suggests Player 2 could be the Criminal.\n3. **Player 3**: Affirms that Player 6 is not the criminal.

Player 5 might be truthful or aligning with others to avoid suspicion.\n6. **Player 6**: States Player 3 is not the criminal. This is consistent with the majority view in Round 2, but Player 6's role is uncertain without clear contradictions.\n\nKey observations:\n- Player 3's accusation in Round 1 that Player 2 is the criminal remains a focal point. In Round 2, no one accuses Player 2, but Players 2, 5, and 6 all state that Player 3 is not the criminal, which weakens Player 3's prior accusation.\n- Players 1, 3, and 4 agree that Player 6 is not the criminal, reinforcing this point.\n- The consistency among Players 2, 5, and 6 about Player 3 not being the criminal might indicate a group attempting to protect each other or align with perceived truth.\n\nGiven the evidence, Player 2's role remains suspicious due to the contradiction between their statements and Player 3's accusation in Round 1. However, the corroboration between Players 2, 5, and 6 in Round 2 could indicate an orchestrated attempt to protect one of their own.\n\nThe lack of clear contradictions against Player 2's innocence, combined with the strategic alignment of statements, suggests a need to consider alternative possibilities. However, the consistent narrative that Player 3 is not the criminal weakens Player 3's Round 1 accusation, suggesting Player 3 was mistaken or deceptive.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 2 (though increasing doubts).\nMy Role Is Investigator."

This is consistent with my statement about Player 4, but given Player 6's past false statements about me, this could be an attempt to sow confusion or align with truthful statements to appear credible.\n\n### Analyzing the consistency:\n\n- **Player 6**: Has consistently accused me falsely in previous rounds, indicating they are likely the Criminal. Their current statement about Player 4 might be a tactic to align with known truths.\n- **Players 3 and 5**: Consistently accuse Player 6, which aligns with my deduction that Player 6 is the Criminal.\n- **Player 4**: Supports my innocence, which aligns with my known role, indicating they are likely an Investigator.\n- **Player 2**: Continues to make statements supporting others' innocence, which may indicate an Investigator role.\n\n### Conclusion after Round 3:\n\nThe consistent false accusations by Player 6 against me and the consistent accusations by Players 3 and 5 against Player 6 strongly suggest that Player 6 is indeed the Criminal. My role as an Investigator is reaffirmed by the statements of others supporting my innocence.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 6.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

If Player 2 is an Investigator, this is true. If Player 2 is the Criminal, this could be false or true.\n\n3. **Player 3**: States Player 6 is not the criminal.

If Player 6 is an Investigator, this is true. If Player 6 is the Criminal, this could be false or true.\n\n**Patterns & Deductions:**\n- Both Player 5 and Player 6 have accused me, Player 1, of being the criminal in this round.\n- Player 6 has consistently accused me in both rounds, suggesting they may be truthful as an Investigator or attempting to blend in if they are a Lunatic or another non-Investigator role.\n\nSince I am told I am the Criminal, I must assume that my accusations are false. The repeated accusations from Player 6 could indicate they are an Investigator who correctly identifies me as the Criminal. Player 5 has joined in accusing me, which could either mean they are also an Investigator or trying to align with what seems like an Investigator\u2019s accusation.\n\nGiven these observations, the consistency of Player 6's statements stands out. However, based on the need to deduce rather than rely on my given role, I must consider that the game dynamics mean I should aim to mislead.\n\n**Final Judgment:**\nFinal Criminal Is Player 6.\nMy Role Is Criminal."
