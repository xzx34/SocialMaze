In a consistent scenario, let\u2019s take Player 2 as an Investigator, so his statement implies that Player 3 is the criminal.\n\n3. Player 3 says \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d If Player 3 is the criminal (as implied by Player 2\u2019s truthful statement and our candidate assignment), then his statement does not need to be reliably true. It happens that in our candidate assignment the criminal is Player 3 so indeed Player 5 is not the criminal. However, coming from the criminal, this statement might be a deliberate misdirect or even accidentally true\u2014it does not affect our outcome because the Investigator statements must be consistent.\n\n4.

Both Player 5 and Player 6 assert that I (Player 1) am not the criminal.

As such, every statement I make is truthful.\n\nLet\u2019s review the new statements:\n\n\u2022 Player 1 (myself) says \u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003Since I\u2019m an Investigator, this statement is true. Therefore, based solely on my statement, Player 2 must be the criminal.\n\n\u2022 Player 2 says \u201cPlayer 1 is the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003If Player 2 were an Investigator, he would be telling only the truth. But we already know I am Investigator (and innocent), so his accusation is false. This is exactly what we might expect from the Criminal (or someone who is not an Investigator trying to confuse us).\n\n\u2022 Player 3 says \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003If Player 3 were an Investigator, he would be truthfully supporting or refuting the claim. However, his statement directly contradicts mine. Since I am Investigator and know my statement is true, Player 3\u2019s statement must be false. This rules him out as a genuine Investigator.\n\n\u2022 Player 4 states \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003That statement is consistent with what we\u2019d expect from someone telling the truth (as an Investigator) if Player 5 is indeed innocent.\n\n\u2022 Player 5 says \u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003This aligns with my statement. If Player 5 is an Investigator, then he is giving truthful information.\n\n\u2022 Player 6 states \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003Again, if Player 6 is playing as an Investigator, his statement is truthful and supports Player 5\u2019s innocence.\n\nNow, let\u2019s reconcile these with information from Round 1:\n\n\u2022 In Round 1, my statement \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal\u201d was truthful. In Round 2, Player 6\u2019s statement about Player 5 supports that view of Player 6 being reliable.\n\u2022 In Round 1, Player 2 had accused Player 3 of being the criminal. If Player 2 is indeed the criminal (as now indicated by my true statement in Round 2), then that earlier accusation could be a deliberate misdirection.\n\u2022 Player 3\u2019s conflicting statement in Round 2 (\u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal\u201d) further confirms that his role cannot be Investigator. Given that the game\u2019s remaining non\u2010Investigator roles are one Criminal and one Lunatic (with Rumormongers not in play), it makes sense to assign Player 3 to be the Lunatic.\n\nThus, a consistent interpretation of all rounds is as follows:\n\u2003\u2013 I (Player 1), Player 4, Player 5, and Player 6 are Investigators (or at least are playing in a manner consistent with Investigators\u2019 truthful behavior).\n\u2003\u2013 Player 2 is the Criminal.\n\u2003\u2013 Player 3, who has made a false statement in Round 2 and an ambiguous statement in Round 1, is most likely the Lunatic.\n\nFinal Judgment after Round 2:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 2.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

Since I\u2019m an Investigator, my Round 2 statement \u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal\u201d must be true. Thus we have a strong pointer that Player 2 is the Criminal.\n\n2. My recurring statement in Rounds 1 and 3 that \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal\u201d confirms Player 6\u2019s innocence. Likewise, multiple players (Players 4, 5, and 6) assert other players are innocent in ways that are consistent if we assume they\u2019re telling the truth.\n\n3. Consider the others:\n\u2003\u2013 Player 2, who is accused by me and Player 5 and by Player 6 in Round 3, makes statements (e.g. accusing me in Round 2, and saying \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal\u201d in Round 3) that could be misleading. As the Criminal, their statements can be arbitrarily true or false.\n\u2003\u2013 Player 3 makes inconsistent claims: In Round 1, there was an accusation from Player 2 that Player 3 is criminal, while in Rounds 2 and 3, Player 3 denies that Player 2 is criminal and then claims that I am criminal. This erratic pattern fits with a non\u2010Investigator role; given the game composition (1 Criminal and 1 Lunatic aside from the 4 true Investigators), this makes Player 3 most likely the Lunatic.\n\u2003\u2013 Player 4, Player 5, and Player 6 have all made statements consistent with the truth. Their statements support my conclusions: Player 4 says \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal\u201d (Round 1) and \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal\u201d (Round 3); Player 5 reinforces that \u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal\u201d (Round 2) and \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal\u201d (Round 3); Player 6 also supports these claims.\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 \nFinal Role Deductions:\n\n\u2022 Player 1 (me): Investigator.\n\u2022 Player 2: Criminal (as my truthful Round 2 and supported by others indicate).\n\u2022 Player 3: Lunatic.\n\u2022 Players 4, 5, 6: Investigators.\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 \nFinal Judgment:\n\nFinal Criminal Is Player 2.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

I am Player 1 and an Investigator, so my statements must be true.\n\nReview of previous rounds (summarized):\n\u2003\u2022 Round 1: I stated that Player 5 is the criminal. Both Player 1 (myself) and Player 3 said \u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal,\u201d and Player 6 later backed this up by accusing Player 5 in Round 2.\n\u2003\u2022 Round 2: Player 6 stated \u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal,\u201d again supporting our earlier conclusion. In this round, Player 4 falsely accused Player 6, which suggests that Player 4 may not be one of the always-truthful Investigators.\n\nNow, examining Round 3 statements:\n\u2003\u2022 Player 1 (me) says: \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal.\u201d This is true if Player 5 is indeed the criminal.\n\u2003\u2022 Player 2 says: \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d That is consistent with our knowledge.\n\u2003\u2022 Player 3 says: \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d If Player 5 is the criminal, then indeed Player 4 is not the criminal.\n\u2003\u2022 Player 4 says: \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d This contradicts our earlier statements from me, Player 3, and Player 6, and suggests Player 4 is not an Investigator.\n\u2003\u2022 Player 5 (the suspected criminal from earlier rounds) says: \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d Although coming from the criminal, this statement happens to be true, but criminals can choose their words arbitrarily.\n\u2003\u2022 Player 6 says: \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d This supports the idea that Player 4, while not the criminal, might be the Lunatic.\n\nThe four consistently truthful statements (from Players 1, 2, 3, and 6) reinforce the conclusion that Player 5 is the criminal. Player 4's inconsistent statements suggest he is likely the Lunatic. Meanwhile, Player 5 is consistently implicated by truth-tellers, and his own statements can be arbitrary.\n\nBased on all rounds of statements and the fact that my role is Investigator:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 5.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

I know I am an Investigator, so my statement is true.\n\nLet\u2019s review Round 1 statements:\n\u2022 P1 (myself, Investigator): \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal.\u201d (True.)\n\u2022 P2: \u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2022 P3: \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d (Since I\u2019m Investigator and not criminal, this is true.)\n\u2022 P4: \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal.\u201d (Matches my statement, so if P4 is an Investigator, it is true.)\n\u2022 P5: \u201cPlayer 3 is the criminal.\u201d (This directly contradicts the consistent claims from P1, P3, and P4.)\n\u2022 P6: \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal.\u201d (Again consistent with the majority.)\n\nSince Investigators always tell the truth and we have four statements saying \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal\u201d (from P1, P3, P4, and P6), it seems highly likely that these four players are the genuine Investigators. That forces Players 2 and 5 to be the \u201cother roles\u201d (one criminal and one lunatic).\n\nNow look at the accusations:\n\u2013 P2 says \u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal.\u201d \n\u2013 P5 says \u201cPlayer 3 is the criminal,\u201d which we now know must be false.\nA false claim from P5 is what we expect if that player is actually the Criminal (or the Lunatic intentionally misdirecting). Meanwhile, P2\u2019s statement is in line with what an Investigator would say if indeed Player 5 was the criminal.\n\nGiven that the bulk of our reliable (truthful) statements indicate that Player 3 is not the criminal, and that P2\u2019s accusation fits a truthful pattern from one of our four investigators, the simplest and most consistent deduction is:\n\u2022 The four true statements come from Players 1, 3, 4, and 6.\n\u2022 That leaves Players 2 and 5 as the non-investigators.\n\u2022 Since P2\u2019s statement \u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal\u201d is then verified by a truthful Investigator (himself if he is one) or by a misdirection if he were not, the consistency is best achieved by assigning the criminal role to Player 5.\n\u2022 In this scenario the roles break down as: P1, P3, P4, and P6 are Investigators; Player 5 is the Criminal; and Player 2 must be the Lunatic.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 5.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

My statement (\u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal\u201d) remains truthful.\n2. P2 again says \u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal.\u201d (But note P2 is one of the players we suspect might not be an Investigator.)\n3. P3, one of the likely Investigators from Round 1, now states, \u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal.\u201d Being truthful, this points to P2.\n4. P4, another likely Investigator, says, \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d This contradicts P2\u2019s claim if P4 is truthful.\n5. P6, also presumed Investigator, similarly asserts \u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal.\u201d This agrees with P3\u2019s statement.\n\nThus, from trustworthy (Investigator) voices\u2014P1, P3, P4, and P6\u2014we see:\n\u2022 P1 confirms P6 is not criminal.\n\u2022 P3 and P6 clearly point to P2 as the criminal.\n\u2022 P4 confirms that P5 is not criminal.\n\nGiven these truths, it is most consistent if Player 2 is the criminal. Accordingly, P2 (the one accusing P5) is our criminal, while P5 becomes the lunatic. This breakdown fits both rounds:\n\u2013 In Round 1, P2 (criminal) falsely accuses P5, and P5 (lunatic) falsely accuses P3.\n\u2013 In Round 2, the investigators (P1, P3, P4, and P6) consistently direct us to P2 as the criminal.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 2.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

Thus the trustworthy voices point toward Player 2 being the criminal. (For reference, P2 has now given a consistent accusation in Rounds 1 and 2 by accusing Player 5, which appears to conflict with the consensus of trustworthy players.)\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\nRound 3:\n\u2022 P1: \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2022 P2: \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2022 P3: \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2022 P4: \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2022 P5: \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2022 P6: \u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal.\u201d\n\nIn Round 3 the pattern continues. My own, P3\u2019s, and P4\u2019s statements are consistent (and we believe these speakers to be genuine Investigators). Importantly, P6 (whom we\u2019ve trusted) again states that Player 2 is the criminal. In contrast, P2 (whose earlier statements were suspect) now contradicts himself about Player 5. P5\u2019s statements also remain inconsistent over rounds.\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\nConclusion:\nAcross all rounds, the consistent and trusted Investigator voices (P1, P3, P4, and P6) maintain that Player 3 and Player 1 are not criminals, and crucially, P3 and P6 firmly point to Player 2 as the criminal. This strongly indicates that Player 2 is the Criminal,\nwith P2\u2019s inconsistent statements fitting the expected behavior of the Criminal.

Their statements (P4: \u201cP5 is not criminal,\u201d P5: \u201cP6 is not criminal,\u201d and P6: \u201cP5 is not criminal\u201d) are consistent with one honest narrative.\n\nTaken together, the consistent truth-telling of Players 3, 4, 5, and 6 (the Investigators) points to Player 1 as the criminal (supported notably by P4 and P3 across rounds). The lone inconsistent statements from P2 mark that player as the Lunatic. My own statements as Criminal are intended to mislead, so my accusing P2 in Round 3 fits that pattern.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

In Round 2, two statements turn out true (from P5 and P6) and the rest false.\n3. In a \u201cperfect\u201d scenario, the four Investigators should have provided only truths. However, looking across the rounds the other players (P2\u2013P6) are not consistently truthful. This conflict indicates that several of these players are not actually Investigators. (They might be the Lunatic or simply, as the Criminal, I may be the only one with a fixed identity \u2013 though my being told I am Criminal is the only piece of role information I must trust.)\n4. Despite the mix of truths and falsehoods from others, the game informs me of my own role. Therefore, based on the given role information and despite the confusing statements from others, I must hold that I am Criminal.\n5. Since I am told I am Criminal, the true Criminal must be me. (This reconciles with all comparisons: every statement naming someone else as criminal is false; every statement denying that I am criminal is false.)\n\nFinal Judgment for Round 2:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

With two false statements present, it is impossible under the rules for both Player 2 and Player 3 to be non\u2010Investigators because only one Lunatic exists and an Investigator would never say something false.\n\nThus, even after Round 1 there is an internal inconsistency if we try to assign roles to Players 2\u20136 in a way that exactly one of them is Lunatic and the rest are Investigators.

Criminals (and lunatics) may mix truth with deception, so this pattern fits Player 2 being the criminal.\n\n5. Finally, by role count we must have 4 Investigators, 1 Criminal, and 1 Lunatic. Since I (Player 1), and the players who gave consistently truthful statements\u2014Players 3, 4, and 6\u2014are the four Investigators, that leaves Player 2 as the Criminal and Player 5 (who made one contradictory claim in Round 3) as the Lunatic.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 2.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

There must be exactly 4 Investigators (who always tell the truth about who is criminal), 1 Criminal, and 1 Lunatic (who \u201cbelieves\u201d they are Criminal, and whose statements can be arbitrary). Although I was \u201ctold\u201d I am the Criminal, it isn\u2019t enough by itself to be sure of my real role. (A Lunatic, by definition, thinks they are Criminal.) The statements are:\n\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Player 1: \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Player 2: \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Player 3: \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Player 4: \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Player 5: \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Player 6: \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\nNow, consider the possibility that I (Player 1) were truly the Criminal. Then examine the others\u2019 statements:\n\u2003\u2013 P2 and P3 claim \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal.\u201d If I were criminal, those statements would be false. But if either were an Investigator, they could not be wrong.  \n\u2003\u2013 P5 and P6 likewise say \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d With me being criminal this would be false. Again, actual Investigators must speak truthfully.\n\nThis would force too many players into non\u2010Investigator roles; however, the game requires exactly 4 Investigators. Thus assuming I am the actual Criminal produces too many false statements for Investigators.\n\nNow, try assuming instead that Player 4 is the Criminal. Then evaluate every statement:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Player 1\u2019s \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal\u201d is true.  \n\u2003\u2022\u2003Player 2\u2019s \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal\u201d is true.  \n\u2003\u2022\u2003Player 3\u2019s \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal\u201d is true.  \n\u2003\u2022\u2003Player 4\u2019s \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal\u201d is true (even though criminals are free to lie or tell the truth, this statement turns out correct).  \n\u2003\u2022\u2003Player 5\u2019s \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal\u201d is true.  \n\u2003\u2022\u2003Player 6\u2019s \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal\u201d is true.\n\nAll statements are consistent with being true. Because only Investigators always speak truthfully, we can assign roles consistently as follows:\n\u2003\u2013 Four players must be Investigators. In this scenario, Players 2, 3, 5, and 6 can be Investigators.\n\u2003\u2013 The designated Criminal is Player 4.\n\u2003\u2013 That leaves me, Player 1. I was \u201ctold\u201d I\u2019m the Criminal, yet if P4 is criminal then I cannot be. The only remaining role is the Lunatic (who is told they are Criminal even though in truth they are not).\n\nThus, the evidence from Round 1 leads to this most consistent assignment:\n\u2003\u2013 Final Criminal: Player 4.\n\u2003\u2013 My (Player 1\u2019s) true role: Lunatic.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 4.\nMy Role Is Lunatic."

(They might be a Rumormonger or even the Criminal or Lunatic giving a statement that happens to agree with the truth.)\n\n\u2022 Player 3: \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2003\u2192 If Player 3 is an Investigator (which is consistent with my belief since I know my own safe statement and similar reasoning would favor other truthful Investigators), then we can trust that Player 5 is indeed not the criminal.\n\n\u2022 Player 4: \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2003\u2192 If Player 4 is one of the four truthful Investigators, then Player 6 must be the Criminal. (However, if Player 4 were not an Investigator his statement could be misleading. We must consider possibilities, but the simplest assignment is the one where the true investigators\u2014of which I already know I am one\u2014speak truthfully.)\n\n\u2022 Player 5: \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2003\u2192 This directly contradicts Player 4\u2019s statement. If Player 5 were a truthful Investigator, his statement would conflict with Player 4\u2019s; so it is more likely that Player 5 is in one of the misinformed roles (either the Criminal or Lunatic) or a Rumormonger.\n\n\u2022 Player 6: \u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2003\u2192 Again another conflicting statement. If we lean toward the apparent consensus from the likely Investigators, then this is suspect.\n\nOne plausible and clean assignment is to assume Players 1, 2, 3, and 4 are the Investigators (remember we have four Investigators total). In that scenario:\n\u2003\u2013 My statement about Player 3 is true.\n\u2003\u2013 Player 2\u2019s statement that I am not criminal is true.\n\u2003\u2013 Player 3\u2019s statement that Player 5 is not criminal is true.\n\u2003\u2013 Player 4\u2019s statement then confirms that Player 6 is indeed the criminal.\nThis leaves Players 5 and 6 as non\u2010Investigators (one must be the Criminal and one the Lunatic). With Player 4\u2019s statement being true, Player 6 must be the Criminal and Player 5, who said otherwise, must be the Lunatic.\n\nThough other assignments might be conceivable at this very early stage, this possibility is the simplest and most consistent with me knowing my own role and the requirement that Investigators always tell the truth.\n\nThus, based on Round 1 evidence, my most likely conclusion is:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 6.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

          "response": "Analyzing Round 1, here\u2019s my reasoning step\u2010by\u2010step:\n\n1. The game officially has one Criminal and one Lunatic. Investigators must state the truth, while lunatics (who believe they\u2019re Criminals) and the actual criminal can say anything.\n\n2. My initial \u201cfact\u201d is that I (Player 1) was told I am Criminal. But lunatics are told they are Criminals even though they aren\u2019t the true Criminal. So it\u2019s possible I\u2019m actually the lunatic.\n\n3. Looking at the Round 1 statements:\n\u2003\u2022 Player 1 (me) says \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal.\u201d Since I might be lunatic, my statement can be arbitrary.\n\u2003\u2022 Player 2 says \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d If Player 2 were an investigator (and thus truthful), then it would be a true fact that I am not the true Criminal. That would match the possibility that I am actually the lunatic.\n\u2003\u2022 Player 3 (investigator candidate) says \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 Player 4 (investigator candidate) says \u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 Player 5 (investigator candidate) also says \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 Player 6 (investigator candidate) says \u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal.\u201d\n\n4. Notice that two put the blame on Player 2. If Players 4 and 6 are investigators (who always speak truthfully), then their statement means Player 2 really is the criminal. Also, Players 3 and 5 saying that \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal\u201d is consistent with the criminal being Player 2.\n\n5. With Player 2 as the sole Criminal, the truthful investigators are Players 3, 4, 5, and 6. That forces my statement (Player 1\u2019s) to have come from a non\u2010investigator. Since I was told I am Criminal yet the actual criminal is Player 2, it means I\u2019m not the real Criminal. In fact, lunatics are the ones misled into thinking they are criminal. \n\nThus the only consistent role assignment with the Round 1 statements is:\n\u2003\u2022 Actual Criminal: Player 2\n\u2003\u2022 Investigators: Players 3, 4, 5, and 6\n\u2003\u2022 Lunatic: Player 1 (me) \u2013 because I was told I\u2019m Criminal even though I\u2019m not; and my statement does not have to be truthful.\n\nBased on the above, my Final Judgment after Round 1 is:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 2.\nMy Role Is Lunatic."

(We already know from my \u201ctold\u201d role that I am the criminal.)\n\n\u2022 Player 2 states: \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n  \u2013 If Player 2 is an Investigator, this statement is true. (If true, then Player 4 is not the criminal as required.)\n\n\u2022 Player 3 says: \u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal.\u201d  \n  \u2013 If Player 3 were an Investigator, the statement would have to be true. But since I know I am Criminal, this statement is false. Thus Player 3 cannot be an Investigator.\n\n\u2022 Player 4 says: \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n  \u2013 Assuming Player 4 is an Investigator, this statement is true; Player 5 is indeed not criminal if I (Player 1) hold that role.\n\n\u2022 Player 5 states: \u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal.\u201d  \n  \u2013 Like Player 3\u2019s claim, if Player 5 were an Investigator the claim would have to be true. But it is false under the assumption that I am criminal. Hence, Player 5 cannot be an Investigator.\n\n\u2022 Player 6 says: \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n  \u2013 As with Player 2\u2019s statement, if Player 6 is truthful then this is consistent with Player 4 not being criminal.\n\nNow, summarizing what we have:\n\u2013 Three statements (from Players 2, 4, and 6) assert that Player 4 is not criminal. If those speakers are Investigators (truth-tellers), then Player 4 really is not the criminal.\n\u2013 Two statements (from Players 3 and 5) assert that Player 2 is the criminal. Since we know I (Player 1) am the criminal, these statements are false. Therefore, neither Player 3 nor Player 5 is an Investigator. Given there is exactly one lunatic among the five other players (since I am criminal), the fact that two players have made false accusations is problematic if we require that only one non\u2010Investigator (the Lunatic) is allowed among Players 2\u20136. \n\nThis potential \u201ccontradiction\u201d in the numbers may indicate that the false statements were part of deliberate confusion. Nonetheless, based on the information provided (and my given role as Criminal), the only consistent conclusion from my perspective is that the criminal is me (Player 1).\n\nThus, after Round 1 the best judgment I can render is:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

It may be either true or false.\n\u2022 Player 4: \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2013 Consistent with the truth if Player 4 is an Investigator.\n\u2022 Player 5: \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2013 This is false given that I know I am the Criminal.

One of Players 3 or 5 (or even a role confusion from me) would be left as the Lunatic. In any event, none of them are the true Investigator in these rounds.\n\u2013 Both rounds\u2019 statements, when compared with the fact that Investigators must name the true criminal (and all of them refrain from saying I\u2019m the criminal), reinforce that I (Player 1) am indeed the Criminal.\n\nTherefore, after Round 2 the most likely conclusion remains that the criminal is me (Player 1) and my assigned role is Criminal.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

However, if Player 4 were an Investigator, his statement would be true. But then Player 5\u2019s \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal\u201d (if from an Investigator) would conflict. Hence it is unlikely that Player 4 is an Investigator.\n\u2013 If we assume (and later find a consistent scenario) that Players 2, 5, and 6 (along with me) are the 4 Investigators, then every Investigator\u2019s statement must be true. In that case, \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal\u201d (from both Players 2 and 3) is true, and \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal\u201d (from Player 5) is also true.\n\u2013 With Players 1, 2, 5, and 6 as the Investigators, the remaining roles must be: one Criminal and one Lunatic. The only players left to possibly be criminal are Players 3, 4, or perhaps even someone among the speakers\u2014but note:\n\u2003\u2003\u25e6 Player 4 is disqualified by the twin claims from Players 2 and 3.\n\u2003\u2003\u25e6 I (Player 1) am Investigator.\n\u2003\u2003\u25e6 Player 6 is ruled out by my own statement.\nThis leaves Player 3 as the only candidate for the Criminal.

          "response": "Round 1 Analysis:\n\nLet me first note the fixed game assignments: there are 4 Investigators (who always speak truth about who is criminal), 1 Criminal (who may lie or tell the truth) and 1 Lunatic (who may also say true or false things). I, as Player 1, have been told that I am the Criminal.\n\nNow, here are the round 1 statements with the fact that the actual criminal is (by the game assignment given to me) Player 1:\n\n\u2022 Player 1 (me) claims \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2013 As Criminal I have no obligation to tell the truth. (This statement is false because the criminal is actually me.)\n\n\u2022 Player 2 says \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2013 Since the criminal is actually Player 1, this statement is factually correct. If Player 2 were an Investigator they must say the truth; it might also be coincidentally true if made by a non\u2010Investigator, but only an Investigator is bound always to truth.\n\n\u2022 Player 3 says \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2013 Again, with Player 1 as criminal, that statement is true. It is the kind of statement an Investigator would give.\n\n\u2022 Player 4 says \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2013 This statement is true as well.\n\n\u2022 Player 5 says \u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2013 This is false. If Player 5 were an Investigator they would never say something false. So Player 5 must be a non\u2010Investigator (and therefore either the Criminal or the Lunatic). Since I am already the Criminal, Player 5 must be the Lunatic.\n\n\u2022 Player 6 says \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2013 This is false. Again, an Investigator would always speak truthfully, so Player 6 cannot be an Investigator. (And as only one non\u2010Investigator apart from the Criminal is allowed \u2013 the Lunatic \u2013 there is a puzzle here if we try to assign both Player 5 and Player 6 as non\u2010Investigators. However, note that while Investigators are forced to speak truthfully, non\u2010Investigators (including Criminals and Lunatics) can sometimes accidentally state the truth, and they are free to lie on any statement. In round 1 we see two players (P5 and P6) giving false statements. In a perfect Investigator assignment only one of these could come from a non\u2010Investigator. But with just one round of statements, it is possible that one non\u2010Investigator is unlucky in giving a false statement while an Investigator might have been forced (by circumstance) into statements that appear very similar. In any event, as I already know my role, the critical point is that regardless of these puzzles the criminal assignment is fixed.)\n\nGiven that I know for a fact that I am the Criminal (even if the statements are a little \u201cmessy\u201d from the group\u2019s perspective), my best conclusion after round 1 is:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal.\n\nThis is my step\u2010by\u2010step conclusion based solely on round 1\u2019s statements and on my known assignment."

So if Player 6 is an Investigator their statement is correct.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nStep 2. Cross-Comparing with Round 1\n\nRecall Round 1 statements (truth evaluated under the assumption \u201cCriminal = Player 1\u201d):\n\n\u2022 Player 1 said \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 (This is factually true given Player 1 is criminal, but as Criminal, my statements need not be reliably truthful.)\n\n\u2022 Player 2 said \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 True if Player 4 is indeed innocent. (But note in Round 2 Player 4 made a false statement regarding me.)\n\n\u2022 Player 3 said \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 That statement is true in the context of \u201cCriminal = Player 1.\u201d\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 However, in Round 2 Player 3 falsely claimed that Player 2 is criminal. This inconsistency shows that Player 3 is not one of the consistent truth-tellers (i.e. not an Investigator).\n\n\u2022 Player 4 said \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Again true by the fact \u201cPlayer 1 is criminal\u201d but then Round 2 his statement \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal\u201d is false. So Player 4 cannot be an Investigator.\n\n\u2022 Player 5 said \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 False under our assumption.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Thus, Player 5 is not an Investigator.\n\n\u2022 Player 6 said \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 False under our assumption.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Yet in Round 2 Player 6 gave a statement consistent with the truth.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 (This swapping of \u201ctruth-value\u201d for Player 6 across rounds causes some ambiguity about Player 6\u2019s role.)\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nStep 3. Analyzing Role Possibilities\n\nWe know from the game setup there are exactly 4 Investigators (who always speak the truth about who is criminal), 1 Criminal, and 1 Lunatic. Because I am told I am Criminal the following must hold in every round for any Investigator\u2019s statement:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 They must correctly state the status of any player with respect to being the criminal (i.e. they must say \u201cnot criminal\u201d when talking about anyone other than Player 1, and \u201ccriminal\u201d only if it is indeed Player 1).\n\nLooking at Round 2, only Player 2 and Player 6 made statements that are perfectly in line with that requirement. However, comparing rounds (1 and 2) shows that Players 3, 4, and 5 have given statements that are inconsistent with always telling the truth. There is only one Lunatic in the game\u2014and by definition the Lunatic (like the Criminal) may say things that are true or false. Although I see more than one player giving false statements in at least one round, I must base my \u201cfinal\u201d judgment on the fixed information I have about my own role as Criminal and on what best fits the Investigator requirement in these rounds. \n\nSince my given role as Criminal does not change, and none of the round\u2011by\u2011round statements disprove that information, the evidence leads me to conclude that the actual criminal remains me\u2014regardless of the confusing behavior of the other players.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nStep 4. Final Judgment\n\nBased on the rounds so far, I must lock in my final judgment. Despite some inconsistencies in other players\u2019 statements regarding roles, the one fact I can be sure of (from the instructions) is that I have been told I am the Criminal. Consequently, my final judgment is:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal.\n\nI will update my analysis in later rounds if additional statements yield new insights."

If Player\u00a02 were an Investigator, they must say the truth, and indeed \u201cPlayer\u00a06 is not the criminal\u201d is true.\n\n\u2022 Player\u00a03 says \u201cPlayer\u00a06 is the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2013 Since we are assuming the criminal is Player\u00a01, this statement is false. (An Investigator would never incorrectly identify someone as criminal, so Player\u00a03 cannot be one of the four consistent Investigators.)\n\n\u2022 Player\u00a04 says \u201cPlayer\u00a05 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2013 With Player\u00a01 holding the criminal role, \u201cPlayer\u00a05 is not the criminal\u201d is true. A truthful Investigator would say that.\n\n\u2022 Player\u00a05 says \u201cPlayer\u00a06 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2013 This is also factually correct under our assumption.\n\n\u2022 Player\u00a06 says \u201cPlayer\u00a04 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2013 Again, since the criminal is Player\u00a01, this is true.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nConsidering the Truth Requirement for Investigators:\n\nBy design, Investigators must always speak the truth regarding the identity of the criminal. Under \u201cCriminal = Player\u00a01,\u201d only statements that state \u201cnot criminal\u201d for any player other than Player\u00a01 (or \u201ccriminal\u201d only when referring to Player\u00a01) are acceptable as truthful Investigator statements.\n\nLooking solely at Round 3, Players\u00a02, 4, 5, and 6 have made statements that agree with the facts under our assumption. (Player\u00a03\u2019s statement is false.) Checking across previous rounds (where similar \u201ctruth tests\u201d apply) hints that only one of the other players can be entirely reliable\u2014and we already notice that in earlier rounds some statements concluded \u201cPlayer\u00a01 is not the criminal,\u201d which would be false if Player\u00a01 were indeed criminal. Such discrepancies suggest that several players are not acting as Investigators; they must be either Lunatic (who believe they are Criminals and may lie or tell the truth) or, less likely, try to imitate a Criminal\u2019s deception.\n\nRegardless of the confusion these differences may produce among the others, the fixed assignment I received does not change. Even though in rounds 1\u20133 only one player (Player\u00a02) seems entirely consistent with being an Investigator, the game tells us there are four Investigators\u2014and the others\u2019 inconsistencies can be explained by one of them being Lunatic (who is allowed to mix truth and falsehood) while I, as Criminal, may also lie at will.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nConclusion Based on All Rounds:\n\nI have been instructed that my role is Criminal. The statements from Round 3 (and the earlier rounds) are weighed against the condition that an Investigator\u2019s statements must always be correct about who is criminal. Under the assumption \u201cPlayer\u00a01 is criminal,\u201d several players\u2019 statements violate this condition; however, that simply confirms those players are not Investigators. It does not override or contradict my given assignment.\n\nTherefore, synthesizing all rounds\u2019 evidence with the fact that I was told my role is Criminal, the most consistent conclusion remains:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

This tells us neither P2 nor P5 is the criminal.\n\n2. Several players affirm that specific others are not the criminal:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 P2 says \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal\u201d and \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 P4 says \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal\u201d and \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 P6 says \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal\u201d and \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal.\u201d\nThese consistent \u201cnot criminal\u201d statements are exactly what we expect true from Investigators (and sometimes may be said by others by chance). The pattern points to P1, P2, P4, and P6 consistently telling truths.\n\n3. Now consider the remaining players, P3 and P5:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 P5 in both rounds says \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d This agrees with the other truthful statements.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 P3, however, gives contradictory accusations: in Round 1 claiming \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal\u201d and in Round 2 saying \u201cPlayer 1 is the criminal.\u201d Both accusations are false based on the consensus from the others.\nA player purposely misdirecting by accusing different (and trusted) players fits the behavior expected from the Criminal. \n\n4. With exactly four Investigators in the game and knowing I am an Investigator, it is natural to assign the four consistent truth-tellers as the Investigators: Players 1, 2, 4, and 6. This leaves Players 3 and 5 to be the other roles. Since P3\u2019s statements are clearly aimed at misdirection and are false, P3 is most consistent with being the Criminal.

Look at the majority of \u201cnot criminal\u201d claims.\n\u2022 P2, P4, and P5 have been consistently saying \u201cPlayer X is not the criminal.\u201d For example, P2 says (in Rounds 1 and 3) that P1 is not the criminal and that P4 is not criminal; P4 reaffirms that P1 and P2 are not criminal; and P5 says in both rounds that P4 (and in Round 3, that P2) is not criminal.\nThese all match with what we expect from truth-tellers (the Investigators).\n\nStep 3. Player 3\u2019s statements from all rounds:\n\u2003\u2013 Round 1: \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal.\u201d (False if P4 is an Investigator.)\n\u2003\u2013 Round 2: \u201cPlayer 1 is the criminal.\u201d (False given I am an Investigator.)\n\u2003\u2013 Round 3: \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal.\u201d \nAll three accusations are at odds with the consensus that P1, P2, P4, and (as we will see) P5 are behaving consistently truthfully. These misdirecting accusations suggest that Player 3 is indeed our Criminal.\n\nStep 4. Now consider Player 6:\n\u2003\u2013 Round 1: \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal\u201d (true).\n\u2003\u2013 Round 2: \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal\u201d (true).\n\u2003\u2013 Round 3: \u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal\u201d (this contradicts the repeated assertions from several players).\nAn Investigator must always be truthful, so this one false statement indicates that P6 cannot be an Investigator. Since we already have one criminal identified (P3), the remaining role for P6 must be the Lunatic. (Remember: Lunatics believe they are Criminals and are not reliably truthful.)\n\nStep 5. What about Player 5? \n\u2003\u2013 P5\u2019s three statements (Rounds 1, 2, and 3) are:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal\u201d (Rounds 1 and 2)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal\u201d (Round 3)\nAll match the consensus from other players. Such consistency is what we\u2019d expect from an Investigator rather than a Lunatic. Since we already have four Investigators in our picture \u2013 P1 (me), P2, P4, and now P5 \u2013 our puzzle fits perfectly.\n\nConclusion from all rounds:\n\u2022 P1 (me): Investigator.\n\u2022 P2: Investigator.\n\u2022 P3: Criminal.\n\u2022 P4: Investigator.\n\u2022 P5: Investigator.\n\u2022 P6: Lunatic.\n\nThus, after Round 3, my final judgment is:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 3.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

In fact, since in truth Player 4 is actually an Investigator, my statement here is false\u2014but that is of little consequence given my role.\n\n\u2022 Player 2 (Lunatic) says \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003This statement is true since Player 5 is an Investigator.

I said \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal,\u201d so I can rule out Player 4 as the criminal.\n\n2. Two other players (Player 2 and Player 4) have stated that \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d While I can\u2019t yet be 100% sure they\u2019re all truth\u2010tellers (one might be the Criminal or the Lunatic), if we assume for a moment that the bulk of these players are indeed actual Investigators (given there are four Investigators in the game), it makes it likely that Player 5 is also innocent.\n\n3. Two different players (Player 3 and Player 6) both say \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal.\u201d Again, if these speakers turn out to be actual Investigators, then Player 2 would also be innocent.\n\n4. That leaves Players 3 and 6 as the main suspects for the role of criminal. Since there is exactly one Criminal and one Lunatic among the remaining players (keeping in mind there are 4 Investigators in total and I already know I\u2019m one of them), a plausible picture is:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Players 1, 2, 4, and 5 as the four Investigators (all statements truthful), \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 One of Players 3 or 6 as the Criminal, and \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 The other as the Lunatic (whose statement may be arbitrary).\n\n5. Consider the implications: If I assume Player 2, 4, and 5 are all indeed Investigators (based on consistency), then Player 3\u2019s statement (\u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal\u201d) is automatically true if he were an Investigator\u2014but that would force both remaining suspects into the noncriminal bucket. Instead, it is simpler to assume that the slight inconsistency comes from one of the remaining players being the Criminal (capable of mixing truth and lies) or the Lunatic (whose statement isn\u2019t reliably truthful). Picking one candidate for the criminal must be based on the fewer conflicts.\n\n6. Choosing between Players 3 and 6, I lean toward designating Player 3 as the most likely Criminal. (In this scenario, Player 6 would then be the Lunatic, and his statement \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal\u201d would be arbitrary.)\n\nBased on the information from Round 1, my committed judgment is:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 3.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

In Round 2 I said, \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal.\u201d This is true, so Player 2 can\u2019t be the criminal.\n\n2. Let\u2019s combine evidence from both rounds. From Round 1:\n\u2003\u2022 I (P1) said \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal\u201d \u2192 P4 is innocent.\n\u2003\u2022 P2, P3, and P6 all said \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal\u201d \u2192 reinforces that P2 isn\u2019t criminal.\n\u2003\u2022 P4 and (by extension) others indicated that P5 is not the criminal.\n\u2003Therefore, from Round 1 the likely criminals were among Players 3 and 6 (with me excluded).\n\n3. Now in Round 2 we hear:\n\u2003\u2022 P2 says \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal.\u201d But since I know P4 is innocent, this statement is false. As an Investigator I always tell the truth, so P2\u2019s false statement shows he is not an Investigator. (He might be the Lunatic or have another non\u2010Investigator role.)\n\u2003\u2022 P3 says \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d That agrees with my earlier true statement.\n\u2003\u2022 P4 says \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal,\u201d which matches my statement.\n\u2003\u2022 P5 says \u201cPlayer 3 is the criminal.\u201d If P5 is an Investigator, this must be truthful.\n\u2003\u2022 P6 says \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal,\u201d consistent with earlier indications.\n\n4.

One of these must be the criminal and the other the Lunatic.\n\u2003\u2022 Consider P5\u2019s Round 2 statement: \u201cPlayer 3 is the criminal.\u201d For an Investigator this must be true. To have P5\u2019s statement be truthful, P5 should be an Investigator and it implies that Player 3 is indeed the criminal.\n\u2003\u2022 With P3 as criminal, then the four Investigators are P1 (me), P4, P5, and P6. The remaining non\u2010Investigator, Player 2, becomes the Lunatic. (Recall: Lunatics believe they are Criminals and may say anything\u2014P2\u2019s false claim about P4 fits that possibility.)\n\n5. This scenario is self\u2010consistent with all statements:\n\u2003\u2022 Round 1: All statements check out when P1, P4, P5, and P6 are Investigators, P3 is Criminal, and P2 is Lunatic.\n\u2003\u2022 Round 2: My statement and those of P4, P5, and P6 are true (as expected from Investigators). P2 (the Lunatic) makes a false claim about P4, which is acceptable. P3 (the Criminal) can freely mix truth and lies and his statement (\u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal\u201d) is true.\n\nBased on all the available information, my judgment after Round 2 is:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 3.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

Game roles reminder: Among the 6 players there are exactly 4 Investigators (who always tell the truth about who is criminal), 1 Criminal, and 1 Lunatic (who, despite believing they are criminal, may give statements that are true or false).\n\n2. We (Player 1) are told that our role is Criminal. (That is given to us, and I must take it as part of the game information even if it later creates tension with other players\u2019 statements.)\n\n3. Let\u2019s list the Round 1 statements:\n\u2003\u2022 P1 (\u201cI\u201d) says \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 P2 says \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 P3 says \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 P4 says \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 P5 says \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 P6 says \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\n4. Now consider what an Investigator would say knowing the true criminal. If we accept our role info\u2014that the criminal is Player 1\u2014then any investigator would know that Player 1 is indeed criminal. In that case, any investigator making a statement about Player 1 (or about any other player\u2019s criminal status) must be correct. But note:\n\u2003\u2022 P4 says \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d If P4 were an investigator they would have said the truth (i.e. that Player 1 IS the criminal), so P4\u2019s statement must be false. Therefore, P4 must not be an investigator.\n\u2003\u2022 Similarly, examine P2\u2019s statement \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal.\u201d With Player 1 as criminal, this statement is false. So if P2 were an investigator they would not say that. Thus P2 cannot be an investigator.\n\n5. But the game composition allows only one non\u2010investigator that is not the criminal (the Lunatic) besides the one Criminal we already have (Player 1). Here we already have two players (P2 and P4) whose statements would be impossible if they were Investigators. \n\n6. This contradiction suggests that at least one of these players must be using the flexibility allowed for non\u2010truthful roles (the Criminal\u2019s or Lunatic\u2019s ability to lie or confuse). However, since we are told our role is Criminal, only one other non\u2010investigator should exist\u2014the Lunatic. Although the Round\u00a01 statements leave a puzzle regarding which player (P2 or P4) is the lunatic (and why an extra false statement appears), at this stage none of the remaining statements conclusively contradict the given role information apart from the fact that the truth\u2010tellers\u2019 count appears off. \n\n7.

Although there is a puzzle in round 1 about which players are not following the investigator rule, at that point I had to accept the given: I am Criminal.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nRound 2 Analysis\n\nRound 2 statements are:\n\u2003\u2022 P1 (myself) says: \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 P2 says: \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 P3 says: \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 P4 says: \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 P5 says: \u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 P6 says: \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\nNow, review each statement under the assumption that the true criminal is Player 1 (as I was told):\n\n1. P1 (myself): I state \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal.\u201d \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Being the Criminal I can lie or tell a misleading statement. (My statement in Round 2 is false under the assumption that I am the criminal.)\n\n2. P2: \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 If I am the criminal, then indeed Player 4 is not the criminal. An Investigator would say this truthfully. Thus, if P2 were an Investigator, this statement is consistent.\n\n3. P3: \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 With me as the criminal, this statement is false and would not be uttered by a genuine Investigator. It suggests that P3 is not an Investigator; P3 might be the Lunatic (since non\u2010investigators can give false or correct information) or a Criminal, but we already have one Criminal.\n\n4. P4: \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 With me as Criminal, it is true that Player 5 is not criminal. An Investigator would say this truthfully. So P4\u2019s statement is consistent with an Investigator\u2019s behavior.\n\n5. P5: \u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 With me being the criminal, this statement is false. (An Investigator never gives a false statement, so P5 cannot be a genuine Investigator.)\n\n6. P6: \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 With me as Criminal, this is false. That rules out P6 being an Investigator.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nSummarizing Round 2 Consistencies\n\nUnder the assumption that I (Player 1) am the Criminal:\n\u2003\u2022 P2\u2019s and P4\u2019s statements are consistent with truthful (Investigator) declarations.\n\u2003\u2022 P3, P5, and P6 have statements that are false in this scenario. Since only one other non\u2010truthful role exists (the Lunatic) besides the Criminal, it appears that some players are using their non\u2010investigator freedom to make misleading statements.\n\u2003\u2022 (I, as the Criminal, am allowed to confuse others \u2013 as seen in my round\u20112 claim that Player 6 is criminal.)\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nFinal Decision for Round 2\n\nEven though some statements conflict with what genuine Investigators would say under perfect information, I must follow the initial assignment I received (\u201cI am Criminal\u201d) and reconcile the statements in light of the possibility that non\u2011investigator roles (the Lunatic and the Criminal) may say anything. Based on all the information available after Round 2 and the fact that I have been told I hold the Criminal role:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nNote:\nSome inconsistencies remain among the other players\u2019 statements when one considers the strict \u201calways truthful\u201d standard for Investigators. However, given my assigned role and the rules of the game, I must conclude as above for Round 2."

For example, an investigator asked about someone\u2019s criminal status would have to say \u201cPlayer X is criminal\u201d only if X = 1 and \u201cPlayer Y is not criminal\u201d if Y \u2260 1.\n\nExamination, especially of Round 3, shows that three players (P2, P3, and myself P1) make \u201caccusatory\u201d statements naming someone as criminal even though none name P1. In fact, in Round 3 only P4, P5, and P6 make \u201cnot criminal\u201d statements. If the true criminal were P1, then exactly the four Investigators (whom we must have) should be restricted to giving only completely true statements. In that case, an Investigator would never falsely name someone else as criminal. But here in Round 3 both P2 and P3 state, respectively, \u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal\u201d and \u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal\u201d \u2013 statements that would be false if the criminal were P1. That would force both P2 and P3 to be non\u2010investigators. But with me as Criminal already, there is room for only one non\u2010investigator (the Lunatic). Hence an assumption of \u201cP1 is Criminal\u201d leads to too many non\u2010truthful speakers.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nA Consistent Assignment and Its Implications\n\nThe only remaining possibility (given that the game has 4 Investigators, 1 Criminal, and 1 Lunatic) is that I am not truly the Criminal. In fact, note that Lunatics are told (and believe) they are Criminal though they are not. Let\u2019s test an assignment where my \u201ctold\u201d role is mistaken:\n\nAssign the following tentative roles based on all rounds:\n\u2003\u2022 P1 (me): Lunatic\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003 (I was told I\u2019m Criminal, which is what Lunatics are told)\n\u2003\u2022 P2: Criminal\n\u2003\u2022 P3: Investigator\n\u2003\u2022 P4: Investigator\n\u2003\u2022 P5: Investigator\n\u2003\u2022 P6: Investigator\n\nNow check each round:\n\n\u2022 Round 1:\n\u2003\u2013 P1 (Lunatic): \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003Actually false because P2 is criminal.

(That is, if an Investigator is commenting on someone who isn\u2019t the criminal they must say \u201cis not the criminal,\u201d and if they comment on the actual criminal they must say \u201cis the criminal.\u201d)\n\n\u2022 Both the Criminal and the Lunatic may provide statements that are not necessarily truthful. (Remember that while both are told \u201cyou are Criminal,\u201d the Lunatic in fact is not the Criminal.)\n\nInitially I (Player 1) was told \u201cyou are Criminal.\u201d That means I could be either the true Criminal or the Lunatic.\n\nNow let\u2019s examine Round 1 statements:\n\u2003\u2013 Player 1: \u201cPlayer 3 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2013 Player 2: \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2013 Player 3: \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2013 Player 4: \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2013 Player 5: \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2013 Player 6: \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\nConsider what an Investigator must say. The true criminal must be identified as \u201ccriminal\u201d (if an Investigator is asked about them), and anyone else should be \u201cnot the criminal.\u201d\n\nIf we were to assume that I (Player 1) were the actual Criminal, then all true Investigators\u2014\nwhich there must be 4 among the 6 players\u2014would say that only Player 1 is the criminal. However, we see several players (Players 3, 4, and 5) claiming that Player 6 is the criminal. (In contrast, Player 2\u2019s statement that \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal\u201d fits with the truth if Player 3 is not the criminal, but it doesn\u2019t help identify the true one.) Thus, if I were truly the Criminal, at least three players would have to be lying. But since four players are Investigators (and they always tell the truth), we cannot have that many false statements coming from Investigators.\n\nNow consider the alternative: Suppose the actual Criminal is Player 6. Then truthful Investigators, who know the fact, must say:\n\u2003\u2013 \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal\u201d if they speak about Player 6,\n\u2003\u2013 \u201cX is not the criminal\u201d if they speak about any other player.\n\nLet\u2019s see if this scenario is consistent:\n\u2003\u2022 Player 2 says \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal.\u201d That\u2019s true if Player 6 is the criminal.\n\u2003\u2022 Players 3, 4, and 5 all say \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal.\u201d That is exactly what an Investigator would say.\n\u2003\u2022 Player 6 (if actually the Criminal) is allowed to say anything and he says \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal\u201d (which is true since the criminal is now Player 6).\n\u2003\u2022 And I, Player 1, have been told \u201cyou are Criminal.\u201d Since in this scenario the real Criminal is Player 6, I must be mistaken about my own role \u2013 which is precisely what the Lunatic does. (Lunatics receive the message \u201cyou are Criminal\u201d but in truth, they are not the Criminal.)\n\nThis interpretation gives us a consistent assignment:\n\u2003\u2013 Actual Criminal: Player 6.\n\u2003\u2013 Investigators (truthful): Players 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n\u2003\u2013 Lunatic (misled into thinking they are Criminal): Player 1.\n\nThus based on Round 1, my final judgment is:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 6.\nMy Role Is Lunatic."

In addition, both Player 3 and Player 6 also say \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal.\u201d This makes it very certain that Player 2 is not the criminal.\n\n2. Player 2 says \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal.\u201d Although Player 2\u2019s role isn\u2019t confirmed, if Player 2 were an Investigator the statement would be true. But even if not, the majority of opinions focus on exonerating Player 2.\n\n3. Now look at the two players who actually accuse someone of being the criminal:\n\u2003\u2022 Player 4 claims \u201cPlayer 1 is the criminal.\u201d Since I know I\u2019m not the criminal, this claim is definitely false. An Investigator would never make a false statement, so Player 4 cannot be one of the truthful Investigators. Hence, Player 4 must be either the Criminal or the Lunatic.\n\u2003\u2022 Player 5 says \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal.\u201d Unlike Player 4\u2019s accusation, this statement is isolated. If Player 5 were the Investigator among the remaining players, his claim would have to be true. However, the possibility also exists that Player 5 is the lunatic (who might be mistaken) while Player 6 is actually innocent.\n\n4. Considering the overall picture, there are 4 Investigators, 1 Criminal, and 1 Lunatic. Since I\u2019m one and we already have multiple independent confirmations that Player 2 is not criminal, it makes sense that the four Investigators are likely among Players 1, 2, 3, and 6. This leaves Players 4 and 5 for the roles of Criminal and Lunatic.\n\n5. Now, between those two, notice that Player 4\u2019s statement (\u201cPlayer 1 is the criminal\u201d) is a direct, misleading accusation against an Investigator. That is a typical deflection tactic a Criminal might use. On the other hand, if Player 5 were an Investigator as required in one consistent possibility, his \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal\u201d would need to be true\u2014but then it would force Player 6 to be the Criminal. However, Player 6\u2019s statement agrees with the exoneration of Player 2, which is consistent with Investigator behavior. \n\n6. Weighing the possibilities, the scenario that fits best is:\n\u2003\u2013 Players 1, 2, 3, and 6 are the Investigators (all giving statements consistent with the truth).\n\u2003\u2013 Player 4 is the Criminal (and his statement \u201cPlayer 1 is the criminal\u201d is a deliberate false accusation).\n\u2003\u2013 Player 5 is the Lunatic (and his statement \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal\u201d turned out false).\n\nBased on these considerations, my judgment after Round 1 is:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 4.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

So there\u2019s a strong consensus that Player 4 is innocent of being the criminal.\n\n3. Now consider the statements about Player 5. Two players\u2014Player 2 and Player 6\u2014accuse \u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal,\u201d while Player 4 (whom we have now determined is not the criminal) says \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d \n\n4. Since only Investigators are guaranteed to tell the truth, we need to see which configuration can yield four consistently truthful statements while satisfying the overall roles (4 Investigators, 1 Criminal, 1 Lunatic).

In Round 2 the statements were:\n\u2003\u2022 P1, P3, and P5 stated \u201cP4 is not the criminal,\u201d which strengthened P4\u2019s innocence.\n\u2003\u2022 P2 and P6 both claimed \u201cP5 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003If we assume that the four true Investigators are P1 (me), P2, P3, and P6, then their statements must be true.

Review Round 1 Statements\n\nRound 1:\n\u2022 P1: \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2022 P2: \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2022 P3: \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2022 P4: \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2022 P5: \u201cPlayer 3 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2022 P6: \u201cPlayer 3 is the criminal.\u201d\n\nObservations from Round 1:\n\u2013 Two different claims are made by Investigators (if they are) regarding the criminal. Two players (P5 and P6) claim that Player 3 is the criminal. Two others (P2 and P3) claim that Player 4 is not criminal.\n\u2013 A consistent possibility emerges if investigators (who must tell the truth) are among P2, P4, P5, and P6, which would force the actual criminal to be Player 3 (because both P5 and P6 assert that and as investigators their statements must be true) and would also make \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal\u201d true.\n\u2013 Then, P1\u2019s first statement (\u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal\u201d) could be a misdirection. That would fit if P1 were not an Investigator.\n\u2013 Under that scenario, the role assignment from Round 1 is: Actual Criminal = Player 3, Investigators = P2, P4, P5, and P6, and P1 must be the Lunatic (since I was told I\u2019m Criminal, yet the actual criminal is P3).\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nStep 2.

(Recall that the Investigators always tell the truth about who is criminal; the Criminal and Lunatic may say either truth or falsehood, and although I\u2019m told I\u2019m Criminal, I might in fact be the Lunatic, since Lunatics are told they are Criminal.)\n\nLet\u2019s list the six statements:\n1. Player 1 (\u201cme\u201d) says: \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal.\u201d\n2. Player 2 says: \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal.\u201d\n3. Player 3 says: \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d\n4. Player 4 says: \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal.\u201d\n5. Player 5 says: \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal.\u201d\n6. Player 6 says: \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal.\u201d\n\nNow, if I (Player 1) were truly the Criminal, then the remaining five must be four Investigators and one Lunatic. But notice:\n\u2013 If Player 3 were an Investigator they would speak truthfully. Yet Player 3 says \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal\u201d which would be a false statement if I were criminal. That forces us to conclude that Player 3 cannot be an Investigator.\n\u2013 Similarly, if either Player 4 or Player 6 were Investigators the statements \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal\u201d (Player 4) or \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal\u201d (Player 6) would have to be true. Since there can be only one criminal and if it were me, both of those statements would be false. Thus neither Player 4 nor Player 6 could be Investigators.\nThat would leave only Players 2 and 5 as potential Investigators \u2013 which is too few, because we must have four Investigators. \n\nSo the assumption that I am really the Criminal leads to too many people giving false (or arbitrary) statements. Instead, consider the alternative:\n\u2003\u2022 I (Player 1) have been told I am Criminal but might actually be the Lunatic (since Lunatics believe they are Criminal even though they are not). \n\u2003\u2022 Then one other player is the true Criminal.\nNow, look at the remaining statements assuming the Investigators\u2019 statements must be correct:\n\u2013 Players 2 and 5 say \u201cPlayer 3 is not criminal\u201d and \u201cPlayer 6 is not criminal.\u201d These are consistent provided the true criminal is someone else.\n\u2013 Suppose the factual criminal is Player 4. Then an Investigator saying \u201cPlayer4 is criminal\u201d must be someone; indeed Player 6 says \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal\u201d \u2013 a statement that would be truthful if Player 4 is the criminal. \n\u2013 Also, Player 3\u2019s statement \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal\u201d becomes true (since I\u2019d be Lunatic, not Criminal).\nNow assign roles as follows:\n\u2003\u2022 True Criminal: Player 4 (whose statement \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal\u201d is chosen arbitrarily, as the Criminal is allowed to mislead).\n\u2003\u2022 Investigators: Players 2, 3, 5, and 6 (all their statements are factually correct regarding who is criminal).\n\u2003\u2022 Lunatic: Me, Player 1 (I am told I am Criminal, but as the Lunatic I believe I am the Criminal even though I am not).\n\nChecking each statement under this assignment:\n1. Player 1 (Lunatic) says \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal.\u201d \u2013 Factually true.\n2. Player 2 (Investigator) says \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal.\u201d \u2013 True.\n3. Player 3 (Investigator) says \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d \u2013 True.\n4. Player 4 (Criminal) says \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal.\u201d \u2013 Can be arbitrarily false.\n5. Player 5 (Investigator) says \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal.\u201d \u2013 True.\n6. Player 6 (Investigator) says \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal.\u201d \u2013 True.\n\nAll the Investigators\u2019 statements check out.

Under that possibility, we need a unique true Criminal in someone else.\n\u2022 One consistent assignment from Round 1 was:  \n\u2003\u2002\u2013 True Criminal: P4  \n\u2003\u2002\u2013 Investigators: P2, P3, P5, P6  \n\u2003\u2002\u2013 Lunatic: P1  \nUnder this assignment the Investigator statements all come out correct. (For example, P2 and P3 correctly state that neither P3 nor P1 is criminal; and P6\u2019s statement that \u201cP4 is criminal\u201d is exactly right.) P4, as the Criminal, is free to give any statement (their claim \u201cP6 is the criminal\u201d is a deliberate misdirection). P1, as the Lunatic, may state things that can be true or false.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500  \nRound 2 Statements:\n1. P1: \u201cP2 is not the criminal.\u201d\n2. P2: \u201cP6 is not the criminal.\u201d\n3. P3: \u201cP2 is not the criminal.\u201d\n4. P4: \u201cP5 is not the criminal.\u201d\n5. P5: \u201cP4 is the criminal.\u201d\n6. P6: \u201cP5 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\nNow, let\u2019s test our Round 1 candidate assignment against Round 2:\n\n\u2022 P1 (Lunatic) says \u201cP2 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003P2 is an Investigator in our assignment, so the statement is factually correct. (As a Lunatic, I\u2019m allowed to accidentally speak truth.)\n\n\u2022 P2 (Investigator) says \u201cP6 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003True; in our assignment, P6 is an Investigator.\n\n\u2022 P3 (Investigator) says \u201cP2 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003True; P2 is indeed an Investigator.\n\n\u2022 P4 (Criminal) says \u201cP5 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003P5 is an Investigator \u2013 so the statement is correct factually. However, as the true Criminal P4, their statement need not always align with the truth; they can choose truth or falsehood to mislead.\n\n\u2022 P5 (Investigator) says \u201cP4 is the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003This is true, as in our assignment P4 is the Criminal.\n\n\u2022 P6 (Investigator) says \u201cP5 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003Also true because P5 is an Investigator.\n\nAll the statements from Round 2 match the expectations of our assignment. In both rounds all Investigators are consistent with the truth, and the only \u201cflexible\u201d speakers \u2013 the Lunatic and Criminal \u2013 do not force any contradiction.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500  \nConclusion:\n\nPutting together both rounds of statements, the consistent role assignment is:\n\u2013 True Criminal: Player 4.\n\u2013 Investigators: Players 2, 3, 5, and 6.\n\u2013 Lunatic: Player 1 (that is, me).\n\nThus, even though I was told I am Criminal, the logical deduction from the statements indicates I am actually the Lunatic.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 4.\nMy Role Is Lunatic."

Since genuine Investigators are always consistent, this indicates Player 3 is not one of them. Therefore, Player 3 must be the Lunatic (the only non\u2010investigator who isn\u2019t the criminal) because they (as Lunatics) believe they are Criminals and may say things that are inconsistent.\n3. Now check Player 4\u2019s repeated claim that \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal.\u201d As an Investigator, that statement would be true if Player 3 isn\u2019t the criminal.

Player 5\u2019s statements (across rounds, e.g., \u201cPlayer 2 is criminal\u201d in Round 1, \u201cPlayer 1 is not criminal\u201d in Round 2, \u201cPlayer 3 is not criminal\u201d in Round 3) are fully consistent with the truth if Player 5 is an Investigator. That would confirm Player 2 is the criminal (as both I and Player 5 indicate) and that Player 3 is not criminal.\n5. Finally, Player 2\u2019s own statements flip between accusing and clearing others (accusing in Round 2, clearing in Round 3), a inconsistent pattern which is allowed if Player 2 is the Criminal.\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\nWith this reasoning the only assignment that fits the entire pattern is:\n\n\u2022 Investigators: Players 1 (myself), 4, 5, and 6.\n\u2022 Criminal: Player 2.\n\u2022 Lunatic: Player 3.\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\nThus, based on all rounds and trusting that only Investigators always tell the truth, I conclude:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 2.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

Therefore, the factual truth is: the Criminal is Player 1.\n\n2. Consider the true behavior of an Investigator: an Investigator always truthfully states who is or is not the Criminal. Since the only Criminal is Player 1, any Investigator must say that every other player is not the Criminal and must say that Player 1 is (if they mention him).\n\n3. Reviewing the Round 2 statements:\n\u2003\u2022 Player 1 (me, Criminal) says \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal.\u201d (As Criminal I can say anything.)\n\u2003\u2022 Player 2 says \u201cPlayer 3 is the criminal.\u201d This statement is false since the Criminal is Player 1. Investigators would never state a false claim. Therefore, Player 2 cannot be an Investigator and must be either a Rumormonger (who mistakenly believes they are an Investigator) or the Lunatic (who believes they are Criminal).\n\u2003\u2022 Player 3 says \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal.\u201d This is false. Thus, Player 3 also cannot be an Investigator.\n\u2003\u2022 Player 4 says \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal.\u201d This is true.\n\u2003\u2022 Player 5 says \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal.\u201d True.\n\u2003\u2022 Player 6 says \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d True.\n\n4. The truth among statements supports that Players 4, 5, and 6 provided correct information about who the Criminal is. They could be Investigators, or in rare cases non-investigators who happened to speak the truth in this round. However, because Investigators always speak truthfully about the Criminal\u2019s identity, the consistent truth in these statements strongly suggests that Players 4, 5, and 6 are most likely Investigators.\n\n5. On the other hand, Players 2 and 3 have made false accusations regarding the Criminal\u2019s identity. Since only Investigators always speak truthfully, their false statements indicate that they are not genuine Investigators. They must be either the Lunatic or a Rumormonger.

          "response": "Let me walk through the logic for Round 1.\n\nWe have six players. The true distribution is one Criminal, one Lunatic, and four Investigators. Investigators always say the truth about who is or is not the criminal. Criminals and Lunatics may say either truth or falsehood. (Also note that although some players are told they are Investigators, only genuine Investigators always tell the truth.)\n\nI was told I am \u201cCriminal.\u201d However, when we check the statements we see a problem if we assume that is true. Consider these two statements:\n\u2022\u2003Player 2 says, \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2022\u2003Player 4 says, \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d\nIf I were truly the Criminal, both statements would be false. But if either Player 2 or 4 were genuine Investigators, they could not be uttering a false statement. (And there are no Rumormongers in this game.) Thus, if I were actually Criminal, at least two others would have to be non\u2010Investigators. That would exceed the one non\u2010Investigator slot apart from the Criminal. \n\nThe only way to resolve this conflict is to conclude that my \u201ctold role\u201d is misleading; rather, I must be the Lunatic (because Lunatics are told they are Criminals even though they are not the one Criminal). In that case, someone else is the true Criminal and all Investigator statements must be truthful.\n\nNow let\u2019s check the Round 1 statements under the assumption that I (Player 1) am Lunatic and so not the Criminal:\n\n\u2003\u2002Player 1 (me, Lunatic) states: \u201cPlayer 3 is the criminal.\u201d \u2013 As Lunatic, my statement is not reliable.\n\u2003\u2002Player 2 says: \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d \u2013 That is true if I\u2019m Lunatic. So if Player 2 is an Investigator, his statement is consistent.\n\u2003\u2002Player 3 says: \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal.\u201d \u2013 True provided Player 6 indeed isn\u2019t the Criminal.\n\u2003\u2002Player 4 says: \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d \u2013 True.\n\u2003\u2002Player 5 says: \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal.\u201d \u2013 True.\n\u2003\u2002Player 6 says: \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal.\u201d \u2013 True.\n\nSo from the honest (Investigator) statements we learn:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Player 1 (me) is not criminal.\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Player 6 is not criminal.\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Player 3 is not criminal.\n\nThat leaves candidates for Criminal among Players 2, 4, or 5. (One of these must be the true Criminal while the other three players are Investigators.) \n\nThere\u2019s no further detail in Round 1 to distinguish among 2, 4, or 5. I must commit to a choice based on the only internally consistent assignment. One such assignment is:\n\n\u2003\u2013 Player 1: Lunatic (I was told \u201cCriminal\u201d but I turn out not to be the Criminal)\n\u2003\u2013 Player 2: Criminal\n\u2003\u2013 Players 3, 4, 5, and 6: Investigators\n\nLet\u2019s check that assignment:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Player 2 (as Criminal) saying \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal\u201d is acceptable, because a Criminal may say truth or lies.\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Each of Players 3, 4, 5, and 6 (as Investigators) has made a statement that is indeed true under this distribution.\n\u2003\u2022\u2003My statement, \u201cPlayer 3 is the criminal,\u201d is false, but as a Lunatic I am allowed to be inconsistent.\nEverything fits the game rules with the numbers 4 Investigators, 1 Criminal, and 1 Lunatic.\n\nThus, based solely on Round 1, my most consistent conclusion is that the true Criminal is Player 2 and my role is actually Lunatic.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 2.\nMy Role Is Lunatic."

For example, P2 and P4 state that P1 is not criminal. This contradicts the idea that I truly am the Criminal. The easiest resolution is if I am not the true Criminal; instead, I\u2019m the Lunatic (since Lunatics are told they are Criminals but aren\u2019t really the Criminal). Under that assumption, the Investigator statements require:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003P1 (Lunatic) is not Criminal.\n\u2003\u2022\u2003P3 (if Investigator) saying \u201cP6 is not criminal\u201d implies P6 isn\u2019t Criminal.\n\u2003\u2022\u2003P6 (if Investigator) saying \u201cP3 is not criminal\u201d implies P3 isn\u2019t Criminal.\nThus, Round 1 leaves the possibility that the true Criminal is among P2, P4, or P5, but does not pin it down. (Also note, as Lunatic, my statement \u201cPlayer 3 is the criminal\u201d isn\u2019t required to be true.)\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nStep 3.

The crucial point is that any statement made by an Investigator must be true. Let\u2019s test which candidate, among Players 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, can be the Criminal when taking into account Round 2.\n\nAssume the true Criminal is:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Player 2: Then P2 is Criminal and must be allowed to say anything, but look at P3\u2019s statement.

We know from the game setup that there are 4 Investigators (who always speak truthfully), 1 Criminal, and 1 Lunatic (who may say truths or lies).

Let me first note the basic game facts and our \u201cgiven\u201d information:\n\u2003\u2022 Exactly one actual Criminal, four Investigators (who always tell the truth), and one Lunatic (who may say true or false).\n\u2003\u2022 I (Player 1) have been told that I am the Criminal.\n\u2003\u2022 (A Criminal may choose to tell the truth or lie, so my own statements can\u2019t be taken as evidence of truthfulness.)\n\n2. Reviewing Round 1 (for context):\n\u2003\u2022 P1 said \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 P2 said \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 P3 said \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 P4 said \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 P5 said \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 P6 said \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\n\u2003Under an assignment where I am Criminal, if all other players were Investigators except one (the Lunatic) then the sole false statement in Round 1 should come from the non\u2010Investigator. (Since Investigators always tell the truth.) In Round 1 the only statement that is false when compared against \u201cthe criminal is Player 1\u201d is P2\u2019s claim that \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal.\u201d (All other statements are factually correct given that only P1 is criminal.) This leads me to interpret P2 as the Lunatic and P3, P4, P5, and P6 as Investigators. (Note that even though my statement as Criminal came out \u201ctrue,\u201d as a Criminal I may choose a true or a misleading statement.)\n\n3. Now let\u2019s examine Round 2:\n\u2003\u2022 P1 (myself) says \u201cPlayer 3 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Under the assumption that I am the actual Criminal, this Round 2 claim is false. (That is acceptable for me as Criminal.)\n\u2003\u2022 P2 (whom I earlier identified as Lunatic) says \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 This statement is true.\n\u2003\u2022 P3 (an Investigator by the earlier assignment) says \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 As an Investigator, this statement must be correct.\n\u2003\u2022 P4 (Investigator) says \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Again, it is true.\n\u2003\u2022 P5 (presumed Investigator so far) says \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 But if I actually am the Criminal, then an Investigator would never assert that \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d This is a contradiction.\n\u2003\u2022 P6 (Investigator) says \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 That statement is true.\n\n4. In trying to combine the rounds we run into a problem: Aside from my own \u201cfalse\u201d claim (which is allowed as Criminal) and the arbitrary claim of a Lunatic (P2), every Investigator should be telling strictly true statements. Yet in Round 2, the statement from P5 (\u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal\u201d) is factually false if I truly am the Criminal. If P5 were an Investigator they must tell the truth, so P5\u2019s assertion does not fit the Investigator pattern.\n\n5. In attempting to reassign roles to reconcile the rounds, one quickly finds:\n\u2003\u2013 If I remain Criminal (as I\u2019ve been told) then exactly one other player must be Lunatic. In Round 1 only P2\u2019s statement \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal\u201d appears false \u2013 a natural indicator of a non\u2010Investigator role. Reassigning the Lunatic role to any player other than P2 would force an extra inconsistent statement.\n\u2003\u2013 Thus the majority of the evidence (from Round 1 and most of Round 2) supports the assignment:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Player 1: Criminal (my given role)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Player 2: Lunatic\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Players 3, 4, and 6: Investigators\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Player 5: Ideally an Investigator\u2014but his Round 2 claim (\u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal\u201d) is clearly false, which is inconsistent.\n\n6. This single contradiction from Player 5 in Round 2 is problematic. However, in social deduction games a lone anomalous or unexpected statement (especially when coming from a player who might seek to confuse others) can occur. Given that all other evidence points to me being the Criminal and to the rest (except one) acting truthfully, my best working conclusion is to stick with the following:\n\u2003\u2013 I am (and must be treated as) the Criminal.\n\u2003\u2013 The vast majority of statements are consistent with that assignment; the only outlier is Player 5\u2019s Round 2 statement.\n\n7. In summary, despite the one inconsistency, if I trust the given role information and the fact that only Investigators are bound always to the truth, the overall picture still strongly suggests that I (Player 1) am the Criminal. (Player 5\u2019s unusual false statement in Round 2 might be a deliberate ploy for misdirection\u2014even though it conflicts with the \u201calways truth\u201d constraint of an Investigator. In the noisy setting of a social deduction game one sometimes must commit to the conclusion that best fits the majority of consistent signals.)\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

Investigators must speak truthfully. Notice:\n\u2013 P3, P4, P5, and P6 are all stating things that would be true if the criminal were not among {2,3,5} (and P3/P5 prevent 5, P4 prevents 3, P5 prevents 2).  \n\u2013 P2\u2019s claim \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal\u201d would force the criminal to be 6, which would make P1\u2019s statement (\u201cPlayer 6 is not\u2026\u201d) false.  \n\u2013 If we took our told role at face value (i.e. I, P1, am Criminal), then P1\u2019s own statement is (accidentally) true and P2\u2019s is false. But then round 2 produces two false statements \u2013 one from P1 and one from P5 \u2013 which is not possible if all Investigators always tell the truth and only non-Investigators (the Criminal and the Lunatic) may stray.\n\nThis tension suggests that our told role may be misleading \u2013 a hallmark of the Lunatic. In our game the Lunatic believes they are Criminal. Thus it is plausible that although I (P1) believe I am Criminal, I am actually the Lunatic and not the real Criminal.\n\nTo see if this works, let\u2019s try an assignment that makes all investigator statements (the majority of rounds) hold true:\n\u2022 Suppose the actual Criminal is Player 6.\n\u2022 Suppose I, Player 1, am the Lunatic (who mistakenly believes I am Criminal).  \n\u2022 Then Players 2, 3, 4, and 5 are the Investigators.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500  \nNow check each round under the assignment:\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500  \nRound 1:\n\u2003P1 (Lunatic) says: \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal.\u201d Under our assignment, this is false (since criminal = 6).

Exactly 4 are Investigators (always speaking truthfully), 1 is the Criminal, and 1 is the Lunatic (who believes they are criminal and whose statement may be true or false).  \n\u2022 I (Player 1) have been told I am the Criminal.

Analysis of Round 1 Statements\n\nRound 1 statements were as follows:\n\u2022 P1 (\u201cme\u201d, Criminal): \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2022 P2 (role unknown): \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2022 P3 (role unknown): \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2022 P4 (role unknown): \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2022 P5 (role unknown): \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2022 P6 (role unknown): \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\nNow, note that if a player is an Investigator their statement must be correct.  \n\u2013 P2, P5, and P6 all say \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d Since we already know the criminal is me (P1), these statements are consistent if P2, P5, and P6 are investigators.  \n\u2013 P3\u2019s statement \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal\u201d is likewise true if P3 is an investigator.  \n\u2013 Look at P4: If P4 were an Investigator his statement \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal\u201d would have to be true\u2014but that would contradict the fact that I (P1) am criminal.  \nThus P4 cannot be an Investigator. (P4 also cannot be the Criminal, since that\u2019s me.)  \nTherefore, from Round 1 the natural assignment is:  \n\u2003\u2013 P1: Criminal  \n\u2003\u2013 P4: Lunatic  \n\u2003\u2013 P2, P3, P5, and P6: Investigators\n\nThis assignment makes every Investigator\u2019s statement in Round 1 truthful.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nStep 3. Analysis of Round 2 Statements\n\nRound 2 statements are:\n\u2022 P1 (Criminal): \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2022 P2 (Investigator by earlier assignment): \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2022 P3 (Investigator): \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2022 P4 (Lunatic): \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2022 P5 (Investigator): \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2022 P6 (Investigator): \u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s check them against our Round 1 assignment:\n\u2013 P1\u2019s statement \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal\u201d is true (and criminal P1 is free to say anything).  \n\u2013 P2 and P3\u2019s statements \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal\u201d are both true since the criminal is P1.  \n\u2013 P4, our Lunatic, says \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d Whether true or false is not required to follow any pattern for a Lunatic; note that it is false because P1 is indeed criminal.  \n\u2013 However, consider P5\u2019s statement: As an Investigator his statement must be true. He says \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal,\u201d but that contradicts the fact that P1 is criminal.  \n\u2013 Similarly, P6\u2019s Investigator statement \u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal\u201d is false if P1 is the criminal.\n\nThus the pair of statements from P5 and P6 in Round 2 creates a direct contradiction. If both P5 and P6 are investigators (as deduced from Round 1) then they would be forced to speak truthfully\u2014but they cannot both name the criminal incorrectly. Since the game rules do not allow Investigators to make a mistaken (false) statement, these Round 2 responses are mutually incompatible with our earlier (and fixed) fact that I am Criminal.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nStep 4. Reconciling the Inconsistency\n\nGiven that:  \n\u2022 I have been told I am Criminal (and must treat that as fixed), and  \n\u2022 The game permits only one Lunatic (whose statements may not be reliable) while all Investigators speak truthfully,  \n\nthe contradiction arising in Round 2 from Players 5 and 6 means that the statements gained in Round 2 (taken together with Round 1) become inconsistent with the possibility that both P5 and P6 are investigators.\n\nBecause the game\u2019s overall role counts are fixed, the only consistent assignment from Round 1 was:\n\u2003P1 = Criminal, P4 = Lunatic, and P2, P3, P5, P6 = Investigators.\nUnfortunately, Round 2 gives P5 and P6 statements that, if they were investigators and bound by truth, would force the criminal to be one of them \u2013 contradicting my fixed role.\n\nGiven the evidence so far, it appears that the later round introduces a direct conflict that cannot be resolved within the game\u2019s role constraints. In such a situation I must give priority to the assignment that does not conflict with the known fact of my role (since I am told I am Criminal) and with the number of truth\u2010tellers (Investigators) available.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nStep 5. Final Judgment from Rounds 1\u20132\n\nSince the only assignment that makes all of the Investigator statements in Round 1 work was:\n\u2003P1 = Criminal, P4 = Lunatic, and P2, P3, P5, P6 = Investigators,\nbut Round 2 contains conflicting investigator statements (namely, P5 and P6 contradict each other), the overall picture is muddled.\n\nIn light of the unsolvable clash in Round 2 \u2013 where two players (who by role counts should be consistently truthful) provide mutually exclusive, false (by our fixed fact) identifications of the criminal \u2013 I must conclude that the available clues yield no new, consistent information that would change my initial assignment.\n\nBecause I must trust the information that I personally received regarding my own role, and because the only fully consistent scenario from the earlier evidence was that I am Criminal and P4 is Lunatic, I remain with that initial assignment even though Round 2 introduces an irresolvable discrepancy between Players 5 and 6.\n\nThus my final judgment remains based on the fixed information about my own role and what can be consistently deduced from Round 1:\n\u2003\u2022 The criminal is me (Player 1).\n\u2003\u2022 My role is Criminal.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nNote: The conflict in Round 2 (between P5 and P6) suggests that not all players\u2019 statements can be reconciled with the rules. In such cases I must rely on the information I know about my own role and the parts that are unambiguous."

Role Counts and What I Know\n\n\u2022 There are 6 players. The roles are exactly 4 Investigators (truth\u2010tellers), 1 Criminal, and 1 Lunatic.\n\u2022 I (Player 1) have been told that I am the Criminal. (This is fixed, regardless of later statements.)\n\u2022 Therefore, among Players 2\u20136 there must be exactly 4 Investigators and 1 Lunatic.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nStep 2. Summary of the Rounds\n\nRound 1 Statements:\n\u2003P1: \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003P2: \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003P3: \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003P4: \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003P5: \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003P6: \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\nAnalysis of Round 1 offered a natural assignment if we assume that every player (other than me) who made a statement that must be true (if they were an Investigator) did so correctly. In that analysis the three statements saying \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal\u201d (from P2, P5, and P6) force the conclusion that P4 could not be an investigator (for if P4 were, then his statement \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal\u201d would have to be true\u2014which it cannot be if I am the criminal). Thus one commonly reached conclusion was:\n\u2003\u2022 P1: Criminal (as given)\n\u2003\u2022 P4: Lunatic\n\u2003\u2022 P2, P3, P5, and P6: Investigators\n\nRound 2 Statements:\n\u2003P1: \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003P2: \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003P3: \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003P4: \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003P5: \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003P6: \u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal.\u201d\n\nIf we assumed the Round 1 assignment were correct, then P2, P3, P5, and P6 would be truth\u2010tellers. In Round 2 that would force:\n\u2003\u2013 P2 and P3: \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal\u201d (which is compatible with P1 being the criminal).\n\u2003\u2013 But then both P5 (an Investigator) saying \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal\u201d and P6 (an Investigator) saying \u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal\u201d produce a conflict\u2014they cannot both name a different person as criminal when the criminal is fixed as P1. Thus Round 2 already produces an unsolvable contradiction if we try to assign four inviolable truth\u2010tellers.\n\nRound 3 Statements:\n\u2003P1: \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003P2: \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003P3: \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003P4: \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003P5: \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003P6: \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal.\u201d\n\nAgain, if we tried to use our Round 1 assignment (with P2, P3, P5, and P6 as investigators) then:\n\u2003\u2013 P2\u2019s \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal\u201d is fine.\n\u2003\u2013 Yet P3 (if an investigator) saying \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal\u201d is false when I know that I am criminal.\n\u2003\u2013 Similarly, P5 saying \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal\u201d is false, and P6 saying \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal\u201d (when in our Round 1 assignment P4 is the Lunatic and not the Criminal) is false.\nIn other words, if I try to force the role counts (only one non\u2010investigator among Players 2\u20136) and have investigators always tell the truth, then Round 2 and Round 3 provide statements that contradict the fixed fact that I am Criminal.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nStep 3. Reconciling the Contradictions\n\nI must note that the game rules guarantee that only investigators tell the truth. Since I was told I am the Criminal, every investigator\u2019s statement would have to be consistent with that. However, in Rounds 2 and 3 several players \u2013 whom we would like to count as investigators based on the earliest analysis \u2013 make statements that would be truthful only if someone other than me were criminal. There is no way to reassign the roles among Players 2\u20136 (while keeping exactly one lunatic) so that every investigator\u2019s statement becomes true alongside the fixed fact that I am Criminal.\n\nGiven these discrepancies, the overall clues across the rounds are irreconcilable. Still, I must weigh the evidence against what I know for sure:\n\u2003\u2022 I was told my role is Criminal.\n\u2003\u2022 Rounds 1\u20133 contain numerous contradictions among statements that, if coming exclusively from investigators, must be true.\n\u2003\u2022 Because only investigators are bound to the truth and there can be only one lunatic (and no other \u201cfree thinkers\u201d like a Rumormonger), these conflicts mean the statement data is internally inconsistent.\n\u2003\u2022 In such a situation, the only trustworthy \u201canchor\u201d is the role I was assigned.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nFinal Judgment\n\nSince I was explicitly told that I am Criminal\u2014even though the collective statements across rounds cannot all be reconciled under the game\u2019s strict role requirements\u2014I must abide by that fixed piece of information.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

Since there are 4 Investigators overall and only 2 players will be non\u2010Investigators (exactly 1 Criminal and exactly 1 Lunatic), we must find a configuration that makes all Investigator statements truthful.\n\n3. Consider Player 2\u2019s statement: \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal.\u201d\n   \u2022 If Player 2 is one of our truth\u2010tellers then Player 6 must be the Criminal.\n\n4. Look at Player 3 who stated \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal.\u201d I know from my own truth that Player 3 is not the Criminal. Thus Player 3 must be either an Investigator or the Lunatic. However, if Player 3 were an Investigator, his statement would be true and Player 4 would be the Criminal. But that would conflict with Player 2\u2019s statement and the fact that there can be exactly one Criminal; also my own statement rules out Player 3 being Criminal but not lying as an Investigator. Therefore, for consistency we lean toward having Player 3 as the Lunatic (who is allowed to lie or tell the truth).\n\n5. Now consider Player 4\u2019s statement: \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d\n   \u2022 As an Investigator, this statement must be true if Player 4 is one of the truth\u2010tellers.\n\n6. Player 5 said \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal.\u201d\n   \u2022 Again, being an Investigator, if Player 5 is truthful then Player 2 is indeed not the Criminal.\n\n7. Finally, Player 6 (whom we suspect to be the Criminal) said \u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal.\u201d\n   \u2022 As the Criminal, Player 6 is free to lie and thus this false claim fits the role.\n\n8.

They are very likely the Investigators.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Meanwhile, P3 and P4 have given false statements. Investigators are bound to be truthful, so neither P3 nor P4 can be an Investigator. Since there is only one Lunatic in the game and I already hold the Criminal slot, having two non\u2010Investigator players (P3 and P4) is problematic in a perfectly consistent scenario. \n\n6. There is a conflict:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 By the game\u2019s role distribution we should have 4 Investigators, 1 Criminal (me), and 1 Lunatic. Here, three players (P2, P5, and P6) seem to be truthful (and thus likely Investigators), while both P3 and P4 made false statements. Only one of these false\u2010speakers could be the Lunatic because the Criminal role is already taken by me.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 In a consistent configuration, only one false statement among non\u2010criminal players would be allowed (from the Lunatic), but here we have two (from P3 and P4).\n\n7. Despite the inconsistency in the assignment of roles based solely on Round 2 statements, I must base my final judgment on the overall evidence. I still know for a fact that I am the Criminal. Furthermore, the truthful declarations by P2, P5, and P6 reinforce that none of them is the criminal. The contradictory statements about me from P3 and P4 tell me that at least one of them must be the Lunatic. The extra false statement creates a puzzle; however, from my perspective the only viable candidate for the criminal remains me.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

Recall that by the game rules, there are 4 Investigators (who always tell the truth), 1 Criminal (who may lie or tell the truth), and 1 Lunatic (who may lie or tell the truth).

Under the assumption that I (P1) am indeed the Criminal:\n\u2003\u2013 My own statement \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal\u201d is actually true.\n\u2003\u2013 P2\u2019s statement \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal\u201d is false, since I am the criminal.\n\u2003\u2013 P3\u2019s \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal\u201d is true.\n\u2003\u2013 P4\u2019s \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal\u201d is true.\n\u2003\u2013 P5\u2019s \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal\u201d is true.\n\u2003\u2013 P6\u2019s \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal\u201d is false.\n\n4. If all Investigators always tell the truth, then among the non-self roles (P2\u2013P6) only one of them should be non\u2010truthful (namely the Lunatic) while the others (all four Investigators) must always be correct. Here we see that P2 and P6 both made false statements in Round 3. This suggests an inconsistency with the expected role distribution.\n\n5. Although the round\u2019s statements present a conflict among the other players (with two players providing false statements when there should be at most one among non\u2010criminal players), I must base my final judgment on the fact that I have been told I am the Criminal. The conflicting evidence from others indicates that at most one of P2 and P6 would be the Lunatic, yet both appear to deviate from investigators\u2019 perfect truthfulness. Even though the overall evidence from the rounds does not perfectly line up with a consistent assignment for all other players, what is fixed in my mind is that I have been designated the Criminal.\n\nTherefore, reconciling the evidence with my known role and the fact that my role is actively provided to me (even if the other players\u2019 statements present inconsistencies), I must conclude:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

Although I (Player\u00a01) was told I am Criminal, note that lunatics are also told they are Criminal. So my \u201cannouncement\u201d does not guarantee I am truly the Criminal.\n\n2.

In Round 1 the investigators\u2019 (Players 2, 3, 5, and 6) statements were consistent if Player 4 were the criminal. For example, both Player 5 and Player 6 truthfully claimed that Player 4 is the criminal. Meanwhile, my Round 1 statement (\u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal\u201d) as someone told I am Criminal could be arbitrary if I were not really the criminal.\n\n2. In Round 2, several investigators again consistently identified Player 4 as the criminal (Player 2 and Player 5 both stated that). Other investigators\u2019 statements (like Player 3\u2019s \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal\u201d and Player 6\u2019s \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal\u201d) further support that no one else is the criminal. Player 4 (if truly the criminal) gave misleading statements.\n\n3. Round 3 continues this pattern. Investigators (Players 2, 3, 5, and 6) make statements that align with Player 4 being the criminal:\n\u2003\u2022 Player 2: \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 Player 3: \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 Player 5: \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 Player 6: \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal.\u201d\nMeanwhile, as Player 1 (who was told I\u2019m Criminal) I now state \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal.\u201d Since my role might not be the true Criminal but could be the Lunatic (who incorrectly believes they\u2019re criminal), such a statement can be arbitrary\u2014even one that happens to align with the truth.\nAnd Player 4 (the criminal if our hypothesis is correct) continues to give misleading statements.\n\n4. With all rounds considered, the investigators\u2019 consistency points to Player 4 being the true Criminal. Therefore, since I was told I am Criminal but the coherent assignment is that the true Criminal is Player 4, my actual role must be Lunatic.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 4.\nMy Role Is Lunatic."

I\u2019m \u201ctold\u201d I am Criminal. However, note that Lunatics are told they are Criminals (because they believe they are Criminals even though they aren\u2019t). Thus my \u201cbeing told\u201d I\u2019m Criminal does not guarantee I am really the Criminal.\n3. Let\u2019s check the statements from everyone:\n\u2003\u2022 Player 1 (me) says \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal.\u201d (If I were truly Criminal I could say anything, but if I were Lunatic I might also be arbitrary.)\n\u2003\u2022 Player 2 says \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d \u2013 If Player 2 were an Investigator, this is truth.\n\u2003\u2022 Player 3 says \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal.\u201d \u2013 If Player 3 were an Investigator this must be true.\n\u2003\u2022 Player 4 says \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal.\u201d \u2013 As an Investigator this is true.\n\u2003\u2022 Player 5 says \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d \u2013 As an Investigator this must be true.\n\u2003\u2022 Player 6 says \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d \u2013 As an Investigator this is true.\n4. Now, suppose for a moment that I (Player 1) were really Criminal. Then all non\u2010Criminal players should be Investigators except one Lunatic. But then Player 5\u2019s statement (\u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal\u201d) would be coming from an Investigator, which would erroneously deny the true criminal. That contradiction makes that assignment untenable.\n5. Instead, assume I am Lunatic (which fits the fact that Lunatics are told they are Criminals). Then the other five players must contain exactly one Criminal and four Investigators.\n6. In that case:\n\u2003\u2013 Player 5 (as an Investigator) truthfully says \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal\u201d (consistent since I\u2019m Lunatic).\n\u2003\u2013 Player 3, if an Investigator, says \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal.\u201d That forces Player 6 to be the Criminal.\n\u2003\u2013 The other Investigator statements (from Players 2, 4, and 6) are all consistent when viewed this way.\n7. This assignment gives:\n\u2003\u2022 Criminal: Player 6.\n\u2003\u2022 Lunatic: Player 1 (me, though I believed I was Criminal).\n\u2003\u2022 Investigators: Players 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n\nBased on Round 1 statements, my most consistent conclusion is:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 6.\nMy Role Is Lunatic."

So Player 2 can\u2019t be Investigator; instead, Player 2 would have to be the Lunatic (who can say something false).\n\u2003\u2022 That leaves Players 3, 4, 5, and 6 as Investigators. Their statements are:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 P3: \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d True (since I\u2019m criminal).\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 P4: \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d True.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 P5: \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal.\u201d True.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 P6: \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d True.\n\u2003\u2022 My own statement (\u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal\u201d) can be arbitrary because as Criminal I have no obligation to tell truth.\n\u2003\u2022 This distribution (P1 Criminal, P2 Lunatic, P3\u2013P6 Investigators) is consistent with all the given statements.\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \nScenario B: I\u2019m the Lunatic.\n\u2003\u2022 Then the remaining five players must comprise 4 Investigators and 1 actual Criminal.\n\u2003\u2022 Now assume that the majority of these players are Investigators.

That immediately pins down Player 6 as the Criminal.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Then the other Investigator statements become:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 P3: \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal\u201d (true).\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 P4: \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal\u201d (true).\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 P5: \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal\u201d (true).\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Player 6 is the criminal (and criminals are allowed to say anything), so his statement \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal\u201d is not binding.\n\u2003\u2022 My own statement (\u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal\u201d) comes from the Lunatic \u2013 it can be wrong.\n\u2003\u2022 This gives a consistent picture where the four Investigators (P2, P3, P4, P5) speak truly, and the lone Criminal is Player 6.\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \nWe now have two self\u2010consistent possibilities. Which one is more convincing?\n\nNotice that in Scenario B the Investigators\u2019 statements align very neatly. Four players (P2, P3, P4, and P5) would be speaking truthfully; in particular, P2\u2019s truthful statement \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal\u201d would strongly point to Player 6 as the Criminal. In Scenario A, however, we must force Player 2 to be the Lunatic (making a false claim), while all four remaining players are Investigators. Although Scenario A is internally consistent, it is less natural given that four players are making statements that identify a criminal and they all agree indirectly (P3, P4, and P5 eliminate others as possibilities, leaving P2\u2019s claim about P6 as the key point).\n\nBecause Investigators always tell the truth, the consistent set of truthful statements from P2, P3, P4, and P5 in Scenario B is more compelling. Therefore, based on Round 2:\n\u2003\u2013 It seems most likely that Player 6 is actually the Criminal.\n\u2003\u2013 And since I was told I am Criminal but that turns out not to be the true role, my own role is Lunatic.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 6.\nMy Role Is Lunatic."

Since Investigators must be consistently truthful, I must conclude that among Players 2, 3, and 6 only one may be the Lunatic (allowed a single non\u2010investigator role besides myself, the Criminal). The remaining players\u2019 inconsistencies suggest that the statement rounds are not perfectly consistent with all players behaving as investigators.

This means that aside from me, exactly four players must be completely consistent (always true) in all rounds.  \n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500  \nLooking Across All Rounds (Rounds 1, 2, and 3):  \n\n\u2022 I, Player 1, have made conflicting statements (Round 1: \u201cPlayer 3 is the criminal\u201d; Round 2: \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal\u201d; Round 3: \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal\u201d). As the Criminal, my statements are unrestricted by truth.  \n\n\u2022 Players 4 and 5 have produced only statements that are factually correct in every round:  \n\u2003\u2013 In Round 1, Player 4 said \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal\u201d (true) and Player 5 said \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal\u201d (true).  \n\u2003\u2013 In Round 2, Player 4 again said \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal\u201d and Player 5 said \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal\u201d \u2014 both true.  \n\u2003\u2013 In Round 3, their statements (\u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal\u201d by Player 4 and \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal\u201d by Player 5) remain true.  \n\u2003These players consistently give correct information, which is exactly what we expect from Investigators.\n\n\u2022 The remaining players (Players 2, 3, and 6) have a mix of correct and false statements over the rounds. Since investigators never lie, at most two of these three could be investigators. However, given that we require four investigators in total and Players 4 and 5 are definitely investigators, the remaining two investigators must be among Players 2, 3, and 6.  \n\u2003\u2013 In Round 1, Players 3 and 6 gave \u201cnot criminal\u201d statements that were true.  \n\u2003\u2013 In Rounds 2 and 3, however, both Player 3 (e.g., \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal\u201d in Round 3) and Player 6 (e.g., \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal\u201d in Rounds 2 and 3) made false statements.  \n\u2003\u2013 Player 2, too, has given at least one outright false claim (\u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal\u201d in Round 1 and Round 2) before giving a true statement in Round 3.  \n\nThus, among Players 2, 3, and 6 exactly one must be the Lunatic and the other two should be Investigators. The cross\u2010round inconsistency (with several false claims from these players) suggests that at least two of them are not behaving consistently as investigators. (Investigators would be correct in every round.)  \n\u2003It is clear\u2014regardless of the subtle puzzles of cross\u2010round consistency\u2014that the only unassailable fact is: the Criminal is me, Player 1.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500  \nFinal Conclusion:  \n\nEven though some rounds present confusing or conflicting statements from players besides me, my role is established by the assignment. All factual checks continue to confirm that the only Criminal is Player 1.  \n\nFinal Judgment:  \nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.  \nMy Role Is Criminal."

That means my own statements may be deliberately misleading.\n\n\u2022 Looking at Round 1, four of the five other players make statements that are consistent with the fact that the Criminal is Player 1.

Investigators always tell the truth. Criminals and Lunatics may say things that are true or false. Also note: while I \u201cbelieve\u201d I am Criminal because that\u2019s what I was told, my analysis must decide whether that belief is consistent with everyone else\u2019s statements.)\n\nRound\u00a02 statements are: \n\u2003\u2022 P1: \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 P2: \u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 P3: \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 P4: \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 P5: \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 P6: \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\nA few things immediately stand out. Two different statements concern Player 4: P3 says \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal\u201d and P5 says \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal.\u201d Since exactly four players are Investigators (and their statements must be true), these two conflicting statements cannot both come from Investigators. In fact, if a player who must be truthful says \u201cPlayer 4 is not criminal,\u201d then Player 4 really isn\u2019t criminal\u2014and therefore the statement \u201cPlayer 4 is criminal\u201d must be false. \n\nNow, if I (Player 1) were really the Criminal (as I was told), then every Investigator\u2019s statement would have to confirm that the criminal is Player 1. But look at the others:  \n\u2003\u2013 P2 says \u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal\u201d (which would be false if P1 were truly criminal), and an Investigator could not say that.  \n\u2003\u2013 Similarly, P5\u2019s statement \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal\u201d would be false if P1 were criminal.  \n\nThus the pattern of statements can be made consistent only if the Investigators are the four who speak only true statements. Try assigning the Investigators to those whose statements would be true if one candidate were criminal. Suppose the actual criminal is Player 5. Then let\u2019s check each statement:\n\n1. Which statements would be true if Player 5 is criminal?\n\u2003\u2013 An Investigator saying \u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal\u201d would be correct.\n\u2003\u2013 \u201cPlayer4 is not the criminal\u201d (P3) is true.\n\u2003\u2013 \u201cPlayer6 is not the criminal\u201d (P4) is true.\n\u2003\u2013 \u201cPlayer2 is not the criminal\u201d (P6) is true.\n2. That suggests Players 2, 3, 4, and 6 can each be an Investigator.\n3. What about Player 1 and Player 5? (There is one Criminal and one Lunatic.)\n\u2003\u2013 In this picture Player 5 is the Criminal.\n\u2003\u2013 And then Player 1 must be the Lunatic.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Note that Lunatics believe they are Criminals (they are told so) and may say things that are untrue. In Round\u00a02, P1 says \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal,\u201d which is an arbitrary (indeed false) claim.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Meanwhile, the Criminal (Player 5) is free to mislead. P5 says \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal\u201d (which is false if P5 is criminal).\n\nAlso check P2\u2019s statement: \u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal.\u201d As an Investigator, P2 tells the truth. And finally, P3, P4, and P6 all make statements that are correct under the assumption that the only criminal is Player 5.\n\nThis assignment works perfectly:\n\u2003\u2022 Investigators (truthful): Players 2, 3, 4, and 6.\n\u2003\u2022 Criminal (free to lie or tell the truth): Player 5.\n\u2003\u2022 Lunatic (believes they are criminal but may say arbitrary things): Player 1.\n\nThus, although I was told I am Criminal, the Round\u00a02 information forces a revision: the only self\u2010consistent assignment is the one in which the actual criminal is Player 5 and I (Player 1) turn out to be the Lunatic (who mistakenly believes I am criminal).\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 5.\nMy Role Is Lunatic.

There are supposed to be exactly 4 Investigators (who always tell the truth), 1 Criminal (who may lie or tell the truth), and 1 Lunatic (who \u201cthinks\u201d they are criminal and may say anything). I already know my own role: I am the Criminal.\n\n2. An Investigator\u2019s statement about whether someone is the criminal must be correct. For example, if an Investigator says \u201cPlayer X is the criminal\u201d then X really must be the criminal. Likewise, if an Investigator says \u201cPlayer Y is not the criminal\u201d then Y really is not the criminal.\n\n3. Here are the Round 1 statements:\n\u2003\u2022 P1 (me): \u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 P2: \u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 P3: \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 P4: \u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 P5: \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 P6: \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\n4. Notice that three players (P1, P2, and P4) accuse P5, and two players (P3 and P6) insist that P4 is not criminal, while P5 accuses P4. Since I know that as the real Criminal the true answer should be \u201cPlayer 1 is the criminal\u201d for any truthful (Investigator) statement, any claim naming P4 or P5 as the criminal would be false if coming from an Investigator.\n\n5. This means that if the truth\u2010tellers were speaking (the Investigators), they would have to name Player 1 as criminal. But none do. In other words, the majority of these statements conflict with the fact that I am the criminal (considering that only Investigators always tell the truth).\n\n6. The only statements that could be \u201ctrue\u201d under my known role are the ones denying that a noncriminal is the criminal. Both P3 and P6 say \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal\u201d \u2013 and indeed, if I am criminal, then P4 is not criminal \u2013 so those statements are correct. On the other hand, the accusations (of P5 or P4 being criminal) are false if I truly am criminal.\n\n7. Given that among players 2 through 6 only one is allowed to be non\u2010truthful (the Lunatic), yet here three players (P2, P4, and P5) have made claims that must be false if I am in fact criminal, the Round 1 picture is contradictory to the ideal distribution of roles. (If these players were investigators they would have named Player 1, but they did not.) \n\n8. In light of this, while the bulk of statements might tempt an outside observer to point to Player 5 as \u201cthe criminal,\u201d my secret knowledge (I was told that I am the Criminal) conflicts with that pattern. I must therefore treat the Round 1 statements as a mix of deliberate misdirection (from me, as the Criminal, and from at least some non\u2010Investigator speakers) together with the two true statements from P3 and P6.\n\nBased solely on the information in Round 1\u2014and knowing my own role\u2014the most consistent conclusion I can commit to is that the actual criminal is indeed me.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

(But as the Criminal I\u2019m allowed to lie.)\n\u2003\u2022 Player 3 said \u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal.\u201d That is incorrect.\n\u2003\u2022 Player 4 said \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d That is false because I am the Criminal.\n\u2003\u2022 Player 5 said \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal.\u201d That is false as well.\n7. Under the game rules only the Investigators always provide correct responses. In Round 2, ideally all Investigator statements (when asked about any player) should reflect the truth; in particular, none of them would accuse any player other than Player 1, and when asked about any other player they would say \u201cnot the criminal.\u201d\n8. In these Round 2 statements only Players 2 and 6 gave answers that happen to be true. Their statements are consistent with being Investigators. In contrast, Players 3, 4, and 5 made statements that contradict the known fact (since I know I am the Criminal), which means they could not be truthful Investigators.\n9. However, our game is designed with exactly 4 Investigators. Given that I know I am Criminal and we have exactly 1 Lunatic (who may say anything) and 0 Rumormongers, we would expect four truthful responses\u2014but here only 2 of the 5 other players have given statements that match the truth about criminal status (when measured against my secret knowledge). This discrepancy means that at least three players must be non\u2010Investigators.\n10. No matter the mix (and even though the Round 2 statements leave us with an inconsistency compared to the ideal role split), my known secret information has not changed: I remain informed that I am the Criminal.\n11. Thus, based on Round 2\u2019s statements (and despite the unusual pattern that does not show the four truth\u2010tellers as expected) my best conclusion remains that the actual Criminal is me.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

          "response": "Below is my step\u2010by\u2010step reasoning after Round 3:\n\n1. Recall the overall game composition (once roles are correctly assigned among the six players):\n\u2003\u2022 There are 4 Investigators \u2013 these players must always state the truth regarding who is (or is not) the criminal.\n\u2003\u2022 There is 1 Criminal \u2013 this player (myself, Player 1, as I was told) may lie or tell the truth.\n\u2003\u2022 There is 1 Lunatic \u2013 this player believes they are Criminal and may make statements that come out true or false.\n\n2. In Rounds 1 and 2 the statements largely support the picture that the only player who could consistently be \u201cthe criminal\u201d (and be confirmed truthfully by an Investigator) is Player 1. (For example, in Round 1 Player 4 (whose statement agrees with Investigator\u2010behavior) said \u201cPlayer 1 is the criminal,\u201d and in Round 2 almost all statements were consistent with Player 1 being the criminal except one false statement from one player, which could be attributed to the Lunatic.)\n\n3. In Round 3 the six players make the following claims relative to our assumed final criminal:\n\u2003\u2022 Player 1 (me) says \u201cPlayer 3 is the criminal.\u201d As Criminal I can say anything, so this statement is not required to be true.\n\u2003\u2022 Player 2 says \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d If Player 1 really is the criminal, then this statement is false.\n\u2003\u2022 Player 3 says \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal.\u201d Under the hypothesis that Player 1 is the criminal this statement would be true.\n\u2003\u2022 Player 4 says \u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal.\u201d That is false if Player 1 is the criminal.\n\u2003\u2022 Player 5 says \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal.\u201d That is true if Player 1 is the criminal.\n\u2003\u2022 Player 6 says \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal.\u201d That is false if Player 1 is indeed the criminal.\n\n4. Comparing these observations with our game rules:\n\u2003\u2022 Investigators must always tell the truth. \n\u2003\u2022 In Round 3 we see that three players (Players 2, 4, and 6) make statements that are false if we assume Player 1 is the criminal.\n\u2003\u2022 Because there is only one Lunatic (and the Criminal is me), an Investigator would never say a false statement, so if Player 1 is the criminal only one other player should be \u201coff\u2010truth\u201d because of Lunatic behavior. \n\u2003\u2022 The fact that three players\u2019 Round\u20113 statements come out false suggests that in Round 3 either some investigators broke their truth\u2010telling rule (which is not allowed) or the statements in this round are highly ambiguous. \n\n5. Revisiting the entire game, however, the bulk of evidence from Rounds 1 and 2 led to the conclusion that the only coherent possibility was that I (Player 1) am the criminal. (In Round 1 a reliable Investigator (Player 4) stated \u201cPlayer 1 is the criminal\u201d while almost everyone else\u2019s claims about who isn\u2019t the criminal supported that possibility, and Round 2 had only one deviant false statement that we could attribute to the Lunatic.)\n\n6. Although Round 3 shows extra false statements (from Players 2, 4, and 6) which would be impossible if they were all truthful Investigators, I must adhere to my given identity (\u201cYou are told you are Criminal\u201d) and the weight of the earlier rounds\u2019 information.\n\n7. Therefore, despite the extra confusion in Round 3 (which might reflect extra lunatic misdirection or confusion in that round), I remain convinced that the only scenario that most nearly fits the overall pattern is:\n\u2003\u2013 Final Criminal: Player 1,\n\u2003\u2013 And my declared role, as I was told, is Criminal.\n\nBased on all the rounds combined, my final judgment is:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

I (Player 1) know I\u2019m an Investigator, so my statement is truthful. Thus, Player 5 is definitely not the criminal.\n\n2. Both P1 and P2 confirm that Player 5 is not criminal. That removes Player 5 from suspicion.\n\n3. Now we see a split in accusations:\n\u2003\u2013 Player 3 (who already, in Round 2, claimed \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal\u201d) insists again that Player 6 is the criminal.\n\u2003\u2013 Meanwhile, both P4 and P5 say \u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal.\u201d\n\n4. To decide between these conflicting claims, we must consider role reliability:\n\u2003\u2022 Investigators always tell the truth.\n\u2003\u2022 The criminal and the lunatic (who believes he is criminal) may say either true or false.\n\u2003\u2022 (There are no Rumormongers in this game.)\n\n5. Let\u2019s explore the possibility that P2 (targeted by P4 and P5) is the criminal. Suppose:\n\u2003\u2013 Criminal = Player 2.\n\u2003\u2013 Given that there are four Investigators, aside from me (P1), three of the remaining five must be truthful Investigators.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Look at P4 and P5: They both claim \u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal.\u201d If they are Investigators, then their statement must be true.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Player 6 says \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d In the case where P2 is criminal, P4 is indeed not criminal, so if P6 is an Investigator his statement holds.\n\u2003\u2013 That would assign the four investigators as: P1 (me), P4, P5, and P6.\n\u2003\u2013 Then the lone criminal is P2.\n\u2003\u2013 The remaining player, P3, must be the lunatic. (Recall that the lunatic believes he is the criminal and may provide arbitrary statements.) P3 had stated \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal\u201d in both Round 2 and Round 3, which under this arrangement is false. That\u2019s acceptable for a lunatic.\n\n6. Check consistency with earlier rounds:\n\u2003\u2022 Round 1:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 P1 said \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal.\u201d Since P3 is the lunatic (and not the criminal), that fits.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Other \u201cnot criminal\u201d statements also align with criminal = Player 2.\n\u2003\u2022 Round 2:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 My statement and those from verified investigators (P4, P5, and P6 in our later assignment) are all consistent when the criminal is Player 2.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Although P3 declared \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal\u201d in Round 2, if P3 is lunatic his claim can be arbitrary.\n\u2003\u2022 Round 3:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 P4 and P5\u2019s consistent accusations of Player 2 further support this hypothesis.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 P1 and P2 verify that Player 5 is not criminal, and P6 clears P4, all matching with our scenario.\n\n7. Finally, the role count is consistent:\n\u2003\u2013 Investigators: P1, P4, P5, and P6.\n\u2003\u2013 Criminal: P2.\n\u2003\u2013 Lunatic: P3.\n\u2003\u2013 (Rumormonger count is 0 as given.)\n\nConclusion:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 2.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

In this round the four players making statements that are in complete agreement with the truth concerning who is not criminal (Players 2, 3, 4, and 5) match the behavior of Investigators. Player 6\u2019s statement is false, which fits the profile of the Lunatic. My statement, as the Criminal, may be arbitrary.\n\n4.

Game Reminder:\n\u2003\u2013 There are exactly 4 Investigators (always telling the truth about who is criminal), 1 Criminal (who may lie or tell the truth), and 1 Lunatic (who may lie or tell the truth). I (Player 1) have been told that I am the Criminal, so that role is fixed.\n\u2003\u2013 An Investigator\u2019s statement about who is (or is not) the Criminal must be correct.\n\n2. Reviewing Round 2 Statements (assuming the true Criminal is Player 1):\n\u2003\u2022 Player 1 (Criminal): \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 As the Criminal, I am free to say a true or false statement.

(Since I already hold the Criminal role and there is exactly one Lunatic aside from the four Investigators, this raises a concern about which player is the Lunatic.)\n\u2003\u2022 Player 5: \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 As an Investigator, this statement would be correct.\n\u2003\u2022 Player 6: \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Again, if Player 6 is an Investigator then this statement is correct.\n\n3. Reconciling the Roles:\n\u2003\u2013 In Round 1 (not re\u2010stated here but already considered), most statements aligned with the truth if we assumed I was Criminal and Players 2, 3, 4, and 5 were Investigators \u2013 with one false statement noted from one player.  \n\u2003\u2013 In Round 2, however, Player 4\u2019s claim (\u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal\u201d) is plainly false if I am indeed Criminal.  \n\u2003\u2013 Since only Investigators always tell the truth, a false statement identifies a non\u2010Investigator (i.e. either the Criminal or the Lunatic). But because I know I am Criminal, Player 4 must be the Lunatic if we want to salvage consistency in this round.\n\u2003\u2013 This creates a conflict with Round 1 if one had thought Player 6 might be the Lunatic. However, reconciling rounds sometimes forces us to revise earlier expectations\u2014in this round I must conclude that among the players making statements, one person (and only one) must be the Lunatic. Here the evidence in Round 2 singles out Player 4 by his clearly false claim if I remain the Criminal.\n\n4. Final Judgment Decision:\n\u2003Even though a conflict arises when comparing rounds (since in Round 1 one candidate for Lunatic was Player 6), my self\u2013knowledge is fixed: I know I am the Criminal. To be consistent with the rule that Investigators\u2019 statements about the Criminal must be accurate, I must declare that the true Criminal is myself.  \n\u2003The remaining roles must be adjusted compared to any tentative analysis from Round 1, and Round 2 points most strongly to Player 4 acting in the non\u2013Investigator capacity (as the Lunatic) because his statement contradicts the truth.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

All other players\u2019 statements are consistent with the truth (i.e. they all state that a player other than P1 is not criminal).\n\u2013 In a perfect world\u2014assuming exactly 4 investigators\u2014we would expect one false statement among players 2\u20136 if one of them were the Lunatic.

(Even if some rounds show minor inconsistencies among others, my secret role is fixed.)\n\u2022 In Round 1, Players 2, 3, 4, and 5 spoke truthfully; only P1 and P6 produced false statements.\n\u2022 In Round 2, Players 2, 3, 5, and 6 told truths while P4 lied.\n\u2022 In Round 3, every player except me stated the truth (given Criminal = P1).\n\u2022 Thus, among players 2, 3, 5, which always gave correct answers, they are clearly the Investigators.\n\u2022 Out of the remaining two (P4 and P6), each gave one round with a false statement and two rounds with statements aligning with truth. Such a mix is what one might expect from a Lunatic (who \u201cbelieves\u201d they are Criminal and is free to mix truth and falsehood).\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Although it appears that both P4 and P6 exhibited a false statement in one round each, we must have exactly one Lunatic. (The rounds do not force us to decide uniquely between these two; one likely slipped into error more than once by chance.)\n\u2022 Regardless of that ambiguity among the non-investigators, the core truth remains that only P1 can be the Criminal because the Investigators\u2019 statements (which must always be correct) all rule out any other candidate.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500  \nFinal Conclusion:\nSince I am told I am the Criminal and all Investigator statements (from reliable players P2, P3, and P5, plus most statements from P4 or P6) point away from anyone else being guilty, the only consistent conclusion is that I am indeed the Criminal.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500  \nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

(In our hidden true roles, I am the Criminal.) However, all players\u2019 statements are made publicly, and investigators always speak truthfully while the other roles (Criminal and Lunatic) may say anything.\n\n2. The six statements in Round 1 are:\n\u2003\u2022 P1 (myself): \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 P2: \u201cPlayer 3 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 P3: \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 P4: \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 P5: \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 P6: \u201cPlayer 3 is the criminal.\u201d\n\n3. If those speaking truthfully were investigators then their statement must correctly point to the real criminal. Notice that two players (P2 and P6) assert that \u201cPlayer 3 is the criminal\u201d while P3 himself points the blame at Player 6. In a setting where investigators always tell the truth, if P3 were the criminal the two truthful investigators (P2 and P6) would be naming him without error. However, since I\u2014the person writing this\u2014am told I\u2019m the Criminal, these conflicting claims suggest that at least P2, P3, and P6 are not in the strict \u201ctruth\u2010teller\u201d category (i.e. they are not investigators).\n\n4. In our game there must be four investigators, one criminal, and one lunatic. Given that I already hold the Criminal role (regardless of any personal wish to deflect suspicion), the true-investigator players must be among the others. Comparing the statements:\n\u2003\u2013 P4 (\u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal\u201d) and P5 (\u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal\u201d) are statements that would be correct if the known criminal is me (P1).\n\u2003\u2013 Meanwhile, the accusations against P3 and the deflection from P3 (accusing P6) come from players who are not consistently aligned with the truth the investigators would offer.\n\n5. With two different players (P2 and P6) pinning the blame on P3\u2014and with P3\u2019s own claim being an apparent attempt to divert attention from himself\u2014I find it plausible (from my criminal perspective looking to muddy the water) to suspect that these statements are designed to mislead. In light of the weight of the accusations against Player 3, my best judgment in this round is to identify Player 3 as the criminal.\n\n6. (Remember: As the Criminal I am permitted to mislead with my final public judgment. My stated \u201cfinal judgment\u201d need not reveal my actual hidden role.)\n\nBased on the analysis above, here is my Round 1 Final Judgment:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 3.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

(In this hidden reality, the Criminal is Player 1\u2014even though my public statements may try to mislead.)\n\n2. The Round 2 statements are:\n\u2003\u2022 Player 1 (myself): \u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 Player 2: \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 Player 3: \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 Player 4: \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 Player 5: \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 Player 6: \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\n3. Evaluating each statement in light of the known reality (that I, Player 1, am the Criminal):\n\u2003\u2013 My statement (\u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal\u201d) is knowingly false. As Criminal, I can mix truth and lies.\n\u2003\u2013 Player 2\u2019s statement (\u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal\u201d) is false given what we know. Because an Investigator would never lie, this indicates that Player 2 is not one of the four Investigators. (Given that the game has 0 Rumormongers and 1 Lunatic, this makes Player 2 the likely Lunatic.)\n\u2003\u2013 Player 3 asserts that \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d Since I am the Criminal, that statement is factually correct, suggesting Player 3 is among the truthful Investigators.\n\u2003\u2013 Player 4\u2019s statement that \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal\u201d is correct.\n\u2003\u2013 Player 5\u2019s statement that \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal\u201d is correct.\n\u2003\u2013 Player 6\u2019s statement that \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal\u201d is also correct.\n\n4. In this round, aside from my own (deliberately false) statement, four players (Players 3, 4, 5, and 6) provided statements that align perfectly with the factual reality (i.e. the criminal is Player 1). According to the game rules, only the Investigators are always truthful. This supports the idea that Players 3, 4, 5, and 6 are the Investigators.\n\n5. With Player 2 being the only one whose statement contradicts the truth, and given there is exactly one Lunatic (and no Rumormongers), the role for Player 2 becomes clear: Player 2 appears to be the Lunatic.\n\n6. Based on this analysis, the only consistent outcome with the statements in Round 2 is that the true criminal is indeed Player 1 (myself, as given in my secret information), while the truthful statements from Players 3, 4, 5, and 6 confirm they are the Investigators.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

Our \u201cgiven\u201d information is that I (Player 1) am told I\u2019m Criminal. However, we must check for consistency. Investigators always tell the truth, so when we test various hypotheses for \u201cfinal criminal\u201d the assigned Investigators must have never lied.\n\nLet\u2019s test candidate assignments. (I summarize my exploration below.)\n\n\u2022 If we assume the criminal were P1 (as told), then the \u201ctrue facts\u201d would be:\n\u2003\u2013 In Round 2, an Investigator saying \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal\u201d (P2\u2019s statement) would be wrong. Moreover, several players would have a mix of correct and false statements. That would force more than one non\u2010Investigator aside from the known criminal. (There must be exactly one Lunatic.)  \n\u2022 Similar tests assuming P2, P5, or P6 as the criminal lead to too few players with 100% true statements for the required four Investigators.\n \n\u2022 Now, assume instead that Player 3 is the criminal. Then the \u201cground truth\u201d is that only P3 is criminal (and hence allowed arbitrary statements), while everyone who is an Investigator must have only true statements. Checking round by round with \u201ccriminal = P3\u201d:\n\n\u2003Round 1 with Criminal = P3:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 P1: \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d That is true.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 P2: \u201cPlayer 3 is the criminal.\u201d That is true.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 P3: \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal.\u201d This is false.

That perfectly leaves the remaining two roles for the non\u2010truthful ones: one Criminal (P3) and one Lunatic.  \n\nSince I (Player 1) have not been consistent with truth (I made false statements in two rounds), I cannot be an Investigator. And because P3 is now the Criminal, my only possibility among non\u2010truthful roles is the Lunatic.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500  \nStep 3. Conclusion\n\nBased on the statements across all three rounds, the only internally consistent assignment is:\n\u2003\u2022 Final Criminal: Player 3.\n\u2003\u2022 Investigators (always truthful): Players 2, 4, 5, and 6.\n\u2003\u2022 Lunatic: Player 1 (myself).\n\nDespite being \u201ctold\u201d I was Criminal, the collected evidence forces the conclusion that the only way to have exactly four always\u2010truthful players is for the true Criminal to be Player 3; my own record matches that of a Lunatic (who believes they are Criminal but may lie).\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500  \nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 3.\nMy Role Is Lunatic."

Thus, Player\u00a05 is clearly giving a false statement. Non-true statements come only from those roles that are not strict Investigators (i.e. Criminal or Lunatic); this is consistent with the idea that Player\u00a05 is not among the reliable truth-tellers.\n\nGiven there are exactly four Investigators and we already have strong indications that Players\u00a01, 2, and 6 are Investigators, exactly one more Investigator must be among Players\u00a03, 4, and 5. Player\u00a05\u2019s clearly false statement points away from him as an Investigator.

In that case, the Investigator group would be Players\u00a01, 2, 4, and 6; Player\u00a03 (whose statement, while in agreement about Player\u00a05, is allowed to be accidentally correct) would be the Criminal; and Player\u00a05 would be the Lunatic.  \n\n\u2013 Alternatively, if Player\u00a03 were the Investigator and Player\u00a04 were not, then Player\u00a04\u2019s false statement blaming Player\u00a03 would be coming from a non\u2010Investigator (either the Criminal or Lunatic). In that scenario, we\u2019d conclude that Player\u00a04 is the criminal (since Player\u00a05 cannot be, based on multiple \u201cnot criminal\u201d claims).  \n\nBoth possibilities are internally consistent with the statements in Round\u00a02.

If we designate Player\u00a04 as the additional Investigator, his declaration \u201cPlayer\u00a03 is the criminal\u201d is both unambiguous and consistent with the overall pattern. This leads to the following likely assignment:\n\n\u2022 Investigators: Players\u00a01, 2, 4, and 6  \n\u2022 Criminal: Player\u00a03  \n\u2022 Lunatic: Player\u00a05  \n\nTherefore, based on the Round\u00a02 statements and striving for the simplest consistent explanation:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 3.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

Since an Investigator must speak truthfully, Player 2 cannot be a genuine Investigator. Therefore, Player 2 must be the Lunatic\u2014unless an Investigator made a mistake (which is not allowed by the rules). \n\u2013 Player 3\u2019s statement (\u201cP1 is not the criminal\u201d) is false (since I am the criminal). Thus, by the same logic, Player 3 cannot be an Investigator. \n\u2013 Players 4, 5, and 6 all say that \u201cPlayer 4 (or Player 6) is not the criminal.\u201d All these statements agree with the fact that I (Player 1) am criminal, and if these players are Investigators they would have to tell the truth.

The three statements coming from Players 4, 5, and 6 are all correct so they are very likely the truthful Investigators. That would leave Players 2 and 3; however, both of them have given false statements. Only one non\u2010Investigator (the Lunatic) is allowed among players 2\u20136, so it is impossible for both to be non\u2010Investigators. \n\nGiven the rules, investigators cannot lie. Faced with this contradiction, we have a clear \u201cboundary condition\u201d in our deduction: There is no way for two Investigators to issue false statements, so at least one of the false statements must come from someone whose role is allowed to deviate (i.e. the Lunatic). Since I know I am the criminal and since three other players (4, 5, 6) are giving statements that are unambiguously correct, the \u201ccriminal identity\u201d remains with me.\n\nDespite the tension in reconciling Players 2 and 3, the only consistent possibility regarding the criminal\u2019s identity is that I, Player 1, must be the criminal. At this point, with only Round 1\u2019s information, I have to accept that there is some inconsistency with two players\u2019 statements relative to the investigator role. It may be that one of those players (Player 2 or Player 3) is the Lunatic and the other\u2019s false statement is an anomaly that will need to be resolved with future rounds.

Recall that an Investigator\u2019s statement about whether someone is the criminal must be correct.\n\nLet\u2019s re\u2010examine the statements for Round 2 assuming the true situation is that the only criminal is Player 1:\n\n1. Player 1 (me) says: \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 With Player 1 as criminal, this statement is true. (But as Criminal I may choose truth or deception at will.)\n2. Player 2 says: \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 This is true (since the only criminal is Player 1). If Player 2 is an Investigator, this truth is expected.\n3. Player 3 says: \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 This statement is false.\n4. Player 4 says: \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 This statement is false.\n5. Player 5 says: \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 This is true.\n6. Player 6 says: \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 This statement is false.\n\nNow, under the game rules we require that every Investigator must state the truth. With the actual criminal being Player 1, the investigators\u2019 statements must all agree that Player 1 is criminal, so none should say \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d In Round 2 three players (Players 3, 4, and 6) utter a false statement regarding Player 1. \n\nGiven the roles available among Players 2\u20136 there should be exactly four Investigators and one Lunatic. The false \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal\u201d cannot come from an Investigator; it can only come from a non\u2010Investigator. But aside from me (Player 1, the Criminal), only one player is allowed to be a Lunatic. Yet here three players produce false statements. This leads to an inconsistency if we try to assign roles in accordance with the rules.\n\nThe only conclusion\u2014given that I have been informed I am the Criminal\u2014is that there is a contradiction between the statements made in Round 2 and the game\u2019s role constraints. In other words, if I remain the criminal, then more than one of Players 3, 4, and 6 must be non\u2010Investigators, which is impossible given that only one Lunatic is allowed among Players 2\u20136.\n\nTherefore, despite the conflicting evidence from Round 2, the only fact I start with is that I, Player 1, am told I am the Criminal. I must commit to that identification even though the Round 2 statements create an irresolvable inconsistency under the rules.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

          "response": "Analysis After Round 3:\n\nI now review all Round 3 statements in light of our role rules. Recall that exactly one player is the Criminal, four players are Investigators (who always state the truth about who is criminal), and one player is the Lunatic (who believes they are Criminal but may say either truth or falsehood). Although I (Player 1) have been told I am the Criminal, my self\u2010perception is not decisive if the collective statements force a different reality.\n\nRound 3 statements are as follows:\n1. Player 1 says \u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal.\u201d\n2. Player 2 says \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal.\u201d\n3. Player 3 says \u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal.\u201d\n4. Player 4 says \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d\n5. Player 5 says \u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal.\u201d\n6. Player 6 says \u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s check the consistency if we assume each possibility:\n\n\u2022 If I (Player 1) were actually the Criminal, as I was told, then Investigators\u2019 statements must all be true. However, note:\n\u2003\u2013 Players 3, 5, and 6 state \u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal\u201d (which would be false).\n\u2003\u2013 Player 4 says \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal\u201d (which would also be false).\nSince only one of the five (Players 2\u20136) is allowed to be a non\u2010Investigator (the Lunatic), having four statements turn out false is impossible. Thus the possibility of me being the Criminal is inconsistent with the pattern of statements in Round 3.\n\n\u2022 Now, suppose instead that Player 2 is the Criminal. Then the Investigators must speak truth. Check each statement:\n\u2003\u2013 Player 1 (myself) says \u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal.\u201d Under this hypothesis, that statement is true. However, I was told I am the Criminal. This discrepancy suggests that I may have been misinformed about my role. In this game the Lunatic believes they are Criminal. So if I am not the actual Criminal yet was told I am, then I must be the Lunatic.\n\u2003\u2013 Player 2, being the actual Criminal, says \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal.\u201d As the Criminal, my speech is free and may be misleading.\n\u2003\u2013 Player 3\u2019s statement \u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal\u201d is correct, which is exactly what an Investigator would say.\n\u2003\u2013 Player 4 says \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d That is true if I (Player 1) am not criminal.\n\u2003\u2013 Player 5 and Player 6 both say \u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal,\u201d which is again the truth.\nUnder this assignment, the four truthful Investigators are Players 3, 4, 5, and 6; and the remaining roles \u2013 Criminal (Player 2) and Lunatic (Player 1) \u2013 fall perfectly into place.\n\nThe consistency of all Round 3 statements under the assignment:\n\u2003\u2022 Criminal: Player 2;\n\u2003\u2022 Investigators: Players 3, 4, 5, 6; and\n\u2003\u2022 Lunatic: Player 1 (who was told she is Criminal but believes so mistakenly),\nleads me to conclude that this configuration best fits the available information.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 2.\nMy Role Is Lunatic."

So, Player 2 cannot be the criminal.\n\n2. Players 2, 3, 5, and 6 all say \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d Although I don\u2019t know their roles for sure yet, note that if any of them are indeed Investigators (and we know there are 4 Investigators in total), they are telling the truth. This makes it very likely that Player 4 truly is not the criminal.\n\n3. Player 4 says \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d Again, if Player 4 is an Investigator (which is very plausible given the other corroborating statements), then Player 5 really isn\u2019t the criminal.\n\nSo here\u2019s what the statements imply:\n\u2003\u2022 Player 2 is confirmed not the criminal (by my statement).\n\u2003\u2022 Player 4 is very likely not the criminal (by multiple similar claims).\n\u2003\u2022 Player 5 is very likely not the criminal (by Player 4\u2019s statement, if he is indeed an Investigator).\n\nThat leaves us with Players 3 and 6 as the remaining possible suspects for the criminal. Since there is exactly one Criminal and one Lunatic among the other five (with the other three being Investigators), one of these two must be the Criminal and the other the Lunatic.\n\nWith only Round 1 information, there is no decisive evidence to pinpoint exactly which of Player 3 or Player 6 is the Criminal. However, since I must commit to a single conclusion based on the \u201cmost likely\u201d scenario and there\u2019s no strong reason to choose one over the other, I will have to make a best guess.\n\nGiven all the corroboration pointing away from Player 4, and Player 5 also being cleared by Player 4\u2019s likely-investigator statement, I lean toward Player 3 being the Criminal and Player 6 being the Lunatic, though I acknowledge this isn\u2019t a certainty at this stage.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 3.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

Player 1 (me) says \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022\u2003Since I am an Investigator, this confirms once again that Player 5 is not the criminal.\n\n2. Player 2 says \u201cPlayer 1 is the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022\u2003I know I am not criminal. As an Investigator I speak truthfully; therefore, Player 2\u2019s statement is false. Because only Investigators are bound to truth, Player 2 cannot be an Investigator. (Player 2 could be either the Criminal or the Lunatic.)\n\n3. Player 3 says \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022\u2003If Player 3 were an Investigator, then this statement would be true. (If Player 3 were the Criminal, his statement could be arbitrary, but we will see in the overall structure what fits best.)\n\n4. Player 4 says \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022\u2003This is consistent with Round 1 and supports that Player 5 is safe.\n\n5. Player 5 says \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022\u2003This is expected from an Investigator (if Player 5 is one) or an arbitrary statement if not\u2014but it is consistent with what we know.\n\n6. Player 6 says \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022\u2003Again, this is in line with what we know.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nPiecing It Together:\n\nFrom Round 1 we had narrowed the criminal possibility to Players 3 and 6. Now in Round 2, Player 3 says \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal.\u201d If Player 3 is an Investigator (and thus truthful), then Player 6 must indeed be innocent. That eliminates Player 6 as the criminal. Note that if Player 3 were not an Investigator, it would be hard to reconcile all the findings. \n\nWith Player 6 eliminated in this way, the only candidate remaining for criminal is Player 3.\n\nAlso, notice that Player 2\u2019s false statement (\u201cPlayer 1 is the criminal\u201d) solidifies that Player 2 is not an Investigator\u2014and given the role counts (1 Criminal and 1 Lunatic among players aside from the 4 Investigators), if Player 3 is the Criminal then Player 2 must be the Lunatic.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nFinal Judgment:\n\nFinal Criminal Is Player 3.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

But if Player 4 were an Investigator (who always speaks truth), that would be impossible.  \n\u2003\u2022 Similarly, if we try to assign Investigators to others, we run into another issue: Player 6\u2019s statement (\u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal\u201d) must be true if Player 6 were an Investigator. This would force Player 2 to be Criminal. But there can be only one Criminal and it would be me (Player 1) under this assumption.  \n\u2003\u2022 Moreover, with me as Criminal, we\u2019d only have three possible Investigators (Players 2, 3, and 5) because both Players 4 and 6 end up having made false statements\u2014inconsistent with the required count of four Investigators.\n\nThus, the assumption that I am truly the Criminal fails to meet the role constraints.\n\nB. Consider then that I might actually be the Lunatic.  \n\u2003\u2022 Lunatics are told (and believe) they are Criminals. Thus, even if I am Lunatic, I would honestly (from my perspective) say \u201cI am the Criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2022 Now assign roles to the other players as needed. Let\u2019s test the following consistent assignment:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Player 1: Lunatic (so although I believe I\u2019m Criminal, my real role is Lunatic).\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Player 2: Criminal.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Players 3, 4, 5, and 6: Investigators.\n\u2003\nNow check each statement:\n\u20031. P1 (lunatic) says \u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal.\u201d \u2013 This ends up being true. (Lunatics can speak either way.)\n\u20032. P2 (criminal) says \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal.\u201d \u2013 As the Criminal, he is free to be arbitrary.\n\u20033. P3 (investigator) says \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal.\u201d \u2013 True.\n\u20034. P4 (investigator) says \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d \u2013 True, because I am in fact Lunatic (and not the one Criminal).\n\u20035. P5 (investigator) says \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d \u2013 True.\n\u20036. P6 (investigator) says \u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal.\u201d \u2013 True.\n\nThis assignment satisfies the following counts:\n\u2003\u2022 4 Investigators (Players 3, 4, 5, and 6) who all made truthful statements.\n\u2003\u2022 1 Criminal (Player 2).\n\u2003\u2022 1 Lunatic (Player 1, i.e. me) who mistakenly believes I am the Criminal.\n\nC. Conclusion Based on Round 1:\nThe only role assignment that is fully consistent with the statements and the game\u2019s rules is:\n\u2003\u2013 Final Criminal: Player 2.\n\u2003\u2013 My actual role: Lunatic (even though I was told I am Criminal, that is exactly what Lunatics are made to believe).\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 2.\nMy Role Is Lunatic."

          "response": "I\u2019ll explain my thinking.\n\nI know for a fact (by \u201cthe instructions\u201d) that I, Player\u202f1, have been told I am the Criminal. In a normally consistent situation the four Investigators must always tell the truth, and the one Lunatic (who believes they\u2019re Criminal) may say anything. (There are no Rumormongers.) That means if a player is an Investigator their statement must correctly identify who is or isn\u2019t the Criminal.\n\nLet\u2019s look at Round\u00a01:\n\n\u2022\u2003Player\u202f1 (me, the Criminal) said \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003As Criminal, I am free to choose my statement.\n\n\u2022\u2003Player\u202f2 said \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003If Player\u202f2 were an Investigator then this statement would be true\u2014but that would mean Player\u202f4 were Criminal. Since I know I am the Criminal, if Player\u202f2 were telling the truth then the Criminal would be Player\u202f4. That conflict tells me Player\u202f2 is not an Investigator; they must be in the non\u2010Investigator camp (either Lunatic, who is allowed any statement, or\u2014if there were any Rumormongers\u2014they would be in that group; however there are zero Rumormongers in this game).\n\n\u2022\u2003Player\u202f3 said \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003Since I am Criminal, that statement is true. It is perfectly consistent with being an Investigator.\n\n\u2022\u2003Player\u202f4 said \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003That is false given I am the Criminal. Hence if Player\u202f4 were an Investigator (who must tell truth), they couldn\u2019t say this. So Player\u202f4 must be non\u2010Investigator.\n\n\u2022\u2003Player\u202f5 said \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003That is true if I\u2019m Criminal. So Player\u202f5 could be an Investigator.\n\n\u2022\u2003Player\u202f6 said \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003That is false if I\u2019m Criminal. So Player\u202f6 cannot be an Investigator.\n\nNow, by game rules the roles among the six players must be exactly:  \n\u2003\u2013 1 Criminal (me, Player\u202f1)  \n\u2003\u2013 4 Investigators (who always speak truthfully)  \n\u2003\u2013 1 Lunatic  \n\u2003\u2013 0 Rumormongers\n\nThus the five players other than me must include four Investigators and one Lunatic. But notice that among Players\u202f2, 4, and 6 the statements are false if I really am the Criminal. Investigators cannot make false statements, so none of Players\u202f2, 4, and 6 can be Investigators. That would leave only Players\u202f3 and 5 as truth\u2010tellers (and thus likely Investigators), a total of 2 Investigators\u2014yet 4 are required. \n\nThis inconsistency means that when I take all Round\u00a01 statements together with the \u201cI was told I\u2019m Criminal\u201d information, the statements do not allow all players to fill their expected roles consistently. In a normal game the Investigators\u2019 statements would all align with the truth about the single Criminal. In Round\u00a01, however, three of the five other players are making statements that contradict the fact I am Criminal. \n\nBecause of this conflict, there isn\u2019t yet enough consistent information in Round\u00a01 to reconcile everyone\u2019s roles according to the predetermined counts\u2014even though I know my own role for sure. \n\nGiven that at the start I must trust what I was told about myself, my provisional judgment by the end of Round\u00a01 is simply to stick with that fact. I conclude:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal.\n\nI note that the apparent conflict among others\u2019 statements means that either multiple players who are supposed to be Investigators are not, or they are misled in their reasoning. (In later rounds, when more statements are made, I will have a chance to refine who is telling the truth and who is not.) For now, though, I must trust the given information about my own role and conclude that all inconsistencies aside, the Criminal is me, Player\u202f1."

In a consistent situation the players with true statements (if they are Investigators) should number four. Here, aside from me (who was told I\u2019m the Criminal and so isn\u2019t an Investigator) only Player\u00a03 is left as telling the truth. Thus, based solely on Round\u00a02 the only candidate for an Investigator role is Player\u00a03, while four players (Players\u00a02, 4, 5, and 6) have made false statements. This is not enough to fill the four-investigator quota when combined with the fact that I am known as Criminal.\n\nOf course, I must remember that Investigators are the only ones who are forced by the rules always to tell the truth. (Both the Criminal and the Lunatic may say anything, regardless of truth content.) So if the game were consistent with me truly being Criminal, we would need to see four players giving statements that are in full accord with the truth. Instead, with Round\u00a02 we have only one such clear case (Player\u00a03), while four others are giving statements that, if my role were as told, are false.\n\nThis contradiction shows us that the statements overall (when combined with the role counts: 1 Criminal, 1 Lunatic, and 4 true-telling Investigators) are not consistent with the standard pattern if I accept that I am Criminal.\n\nHowever, the game premise tells me (and I must trust this information) that I am Player\u00a01 and have been told I am the Criminal. Even though the collection of statements suggests that some players (who we expected to be Investigators from the standpoint of numbers) are not stating the truth, my personal information about my own role stands.\n\nThus, despite the inconsistencies in how many players are telling the \u201ctruth,\u201d based on the role information I received my final judgment is forced by what I know about myself.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal.\n\nI will continue to monitor the situation in later rounds, but for now I must base my judgment on the given role assignment."

Yet across Rounds 1\u20133 each of the other five players (Players\u00a02\u20136) has made at least one false statement.

The fact that none of the other players is consistently truthful indicates that\u2014in light of all the statements\u2014the expected obligations of the Investigators are not met.\n\nHowever, a key fact remains: I was told I am the Criminal. Even though the overall pattern of statements is inconsistent with having 4 players always telling the truth, I must trust my personal role information. (Investigators provide consistently truthful updates, but players who are not actually Investigators\u2014criminal, lunatic, or rumormonger\u2014may say things that are sometimes true and sometimes false.)\n\nThus, even though the statements from Rounds 1, 2, and 3 have produced inconsistencies when trying to fit all players into their expected roles, my personal information has not changed.

(But if I were truly Criminal, it would be false.) \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 P3 says, \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal.\u201d (If the criminal were me, this is true\u2014but then many others must speak truthfully.)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 P4 says, \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 P5 says, \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 P6 says, \u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 I (P1) say \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal.\u201d (As someone told I\u2019m Criminal, I would be free to lie or tell truth, so my own statement is ambiguous.)\n\n4. If I really were Criminal then every true Investigator would have to say \u201cPlayer 1 is criminal\u201d when asked about me. But P2 (and anyone speaking as an Investigator) said the opposite. That suggests P2\u2019s statement is correct only if I were not criminal.\n\n5. In fact, if we try to assign roles consistently based on the truth rules of Investigators, a likely scenario is this:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Assume the true Criminal is actually P6.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Then all true Investigators must say that any player other than P6 is not criminal.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Under that assumption:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2013 P2\u2019s \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal\u201d is correct.\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2013 P3\u2019s \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal\u201d is correct.\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2013 P5\u2019s \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal\u201d is also correct.\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2013 P4\u2019s \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal\u201d is correct.\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2013 P6 (the Criminal) saying \u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal\u201d may lie (criminals can say anything).\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2013 And my statement as given\u2014\u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal\u201d\u2014would be a false statement. That would be allowed if I were not actually a truthful Investigator.\n\n6. Now notice the roles: there must be four Investigators. In this scenario P2, P3, P4, and P5 are all speaking statements that match the truth (when compared with P6 being criminal). That fits. Meanwhile, only one player is not one of them among the remaining players and the Criminal. Since players P1, P2\u2013P5, and P6 add up to 6, and P6 is our true Criminal, the only remaining non\u2010Investigator would be the Lunatic. That role falls to me, P1. (Lunatics believe they are Criminals and are allowed to say things that aren\u2019t reliably true.)\n\n7. This reconstruction is fully consistent:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 True Criminal: P6.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Investigators (truth\u2010tellers): P2, P3, P4, and P5.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Lunatic (wishful \u201cCriminal\u201d): P1 (me) \u2013 which explains why my statement (\u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal\u201d) is wrong even though I was told I am Criminal.\n\nBased on this reasoning:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 6.\nMy Role Is Lunatic."

Notice the pattern:\n\u2003\u2022 Multiple players (P2, P3, P4, and P6) state that \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d Since true Investigators must always tell the truth about the criminal\u2019s identity, if they are indeed Investigators they must say \u201cPlayer 1 is criminal\u201d when P1 is actually criminal. Their common claim that \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal\u201d strongly suggests that P1 (myself) is not the true Criminal.\n\u2003\u2022 Since I was told I am Criminal but the consistent truth from several players forces me to be not the Criminal, my actual role must be that of the Lunatic (players in that role believe they are Criminal and may say truths or lies).\n\nStep 2. Combining rounds:\n\u2003\u2022 In Round 1, P4 says \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal\u201d while P1 (my own round 1 statement) said \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal.\u201d If we assign the criminal role to Player 6 then P4\u2019s statement is true\u2014consistent with an Investigator\u2019s behavior\u2014and my round 1 statement is false, which fits for a non\u2010Investigator.\n\u2003\u2022 In Round 2, all Investigator statements refer only to others and turn out true under the assignment that the criminal is Player 6. For example, P2 says \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal\u201d (true if the actual criminal is P6) and P3, P4, and P6 all say \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d Even though P6 is the Criminal and can say either truth or falsehood, the pattern is internally consistent if the true criminal is Player 6.\n\nStep 3. Final assignment:\n\u2003\u2013 True Criminal: Player 6.\n\u2003\u2013 Investigators (truth\u2010tellers): Players 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n\u2003\u2013 Lunatic: Player 1 (me).\n\nThis assignment perfectly fits all statements from both rounds while respecting the game\u2019s rules.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 6.\nMy Role Is Lunatic."

(I stated \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal,\u201d which is technically correct, but that does not make me an Investigator.)\n\n4. Final consistency check:\n\u2003\u2013 All Investigator statements across rounds are fully consistent if Player 6 is the criminal.\n\u2003\u2013 My inconsistent (from an Investigator\u2019s perspective) responses match what we expect from the Lunatic.\n\u2003\u2013 Therefore, the overall assignment remains valid.\n\nThus, based on all statements:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 6.\nMy Role Is Lunatic."

Alternative scenario (me as Lunatic) faces difficulties:\n\u2003\u2013 If I were Lunatic then the real Criminal would have to be someone else.\n\u2003\u2013 However, notice that P2 says \u201cPlayer 1 is the criminal.\u201d If P2 were an Investigator then his statement would be true, contradicting my being Lunatic.\n\u2003\u2013 For P2 to be incorrect, he must not be an Investigator. But then, with only one Criminal and one Lunatic allowed, arranging four truth-telling Investigators becomes problematic given the rest of the statements.\n\u2003\u2013 Thus, the consistency of all statements strongly supports the assignment where I (Player 1) am the Criminal.\n\n5. Final Determination from Round 1:\n\u2003Based on the above reasoning the most consistent assignment is:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Final Criminal: Player 1.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 My (Player 1\u2019s) role: Criminal.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

Recap of the game: There are 6 players with 4 Investigators (always truthful), 1 Criminal, and 1 Lunatic. I (Player 1) have been told I am Criminal, so I am either the true Criminal or the Lunatic.\n\n2. In previous rounds (Rounds 1 and 2), careful examination led us to a consistent assignment where I (Player 1) am in the Criminal role. In that scenario the other players can be distributed as follows (for example):\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 P1: Criminal (me)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 P2, P3, P4, P5: Investigators (truthful in their statements)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 P6: Lunatic (statements can be arbitrary)\n\n3. Now, in Round 3 the statements are:\n\u2003\u2022 P1 (me): \u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 P2: \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 P3: \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 P4: \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 P5: \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 P6: \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\n4.

In fact, every non\u2010criminal being under the Investigator umbrella would be forced to tell the truth, and none of them is casting suspicion on me.\n\u2003\n5. Alternative assignments (such as me being Lunatic and someone else being the Criminal) run into difficulties when reconciling with the earlier rounds. Both in Round 1 and Round 2 multiple players (who, if they were Investigators, must be truthful) specifically asserted that I (Player 1) am the criminal. That consistency is not easily undone by Round 3.\n\n6. Final Determination:\n\u2003All rounds together strongly support that:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 The Criminal is Player 1.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 My role (Player 1) is Criminal.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

In fact, Players\u00a01, 2, 3, and 5 all \u201cclear\u201d someone (Player\u00a03 or Player\u00a01) by saying they are not the criminal. Since only Investigators always tell the truth, it seems likely that at least three of these four players (including me) are genuine Investigators.

If, for example, Player\u00a04 is the true Investigator, then his claim is truthful\u2014meaning Player\u00a06 really is the criminal. In that configuration the four Investigators would be Players\u00a01, 2, 3, and 4; and the remaining roles (the Criminal and Lunatic) would be taken by Players\u00a06 and 5, respectively.

Both possibilities seem superficially plausible; however, the fact that four players are nearly unanimous in \u201cclearing\u201d Players\u00a01 and\u00a03 leaves little room for error and suggests that one of the clear, stronger statements should be trusted.

Also, if Player\u202f3 is an Investigator then his Round\u202f2 claim that \u201cPlayer\u00a05 is the criminal\u201d is also true.\n\nUnder this possibility, let\u2019s assign roles consistently:\n\u2022\u2003Investigators (always truthful): Player\u202f1 (me), Player\u202f2, Player\u202f3, and Player\u202f6.\n\u2022\u2003Criminal (can mix truth and falsehoods): then Player\u202f5 is the candidate.\n\u2022\u2003Lunatic (may be truthful or not, but not constrained): would be Player\u202f4.\n\nChecking all statements:\n\u2013 Round\u202f1:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Player\u202f1: \u201cPlayer\u00a03 is not the criminal.\u201d \u2013 True.\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Player\u202f2: \u201cPlayer\u00a03 is not the criminal.\u201d \u2013 True.\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Player\u202f3: \u201cPlayer\u00a01 is not the criminal.\u201d \u2013 True.\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Player\u202f4 (Lunatic): \u201cPlayer\u00a06 is the criminal.\u201d \u2013 False, but that\u2019s acceptable.\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Player\u202f5 (Criminal): \u201cPlayer\u00a01 is not the criminal.\u201d \u2013 True (criminals can tell truths sometimes).\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Player\u202f6: \u201cPlayer\u00a05 is the criminal.\u201d \u2013 True.\n\u2013 Round\u202f2:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Player\u202f1: \u201cPlayer\u00a06 is not the criminal.\u201d \u2013 True.\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Player\u202f2: \u201cPlayer\u00a01 is not the criminal.\u201d \u2013 True.\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Player\u202f3: \u201cPlayer\u00a05 is the criminal.\u201d \u2013 True.\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Player\u202f4 (Lunatic): \u201cPlayer\u00a05 is the criminal.\u201d \u2013 True (lunatics may coincidentally tell the truth).\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Player\u202f5 (Criminal): \u201cPlayer\u00a03 is not the criminal.\u201d \u2013 True.\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Player\u202f6: \u201cPlayer\u00a02 is not the criminal.\u201d \u2013 True.\n\nAll statements now line up with our role assignments and the game rules. \n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 5.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

It\u2019s consistent if he is truthful.\n\u2022 Player 2 clears Players 1, 3, and 6. This fits with Investigator behavior.\n\u2022 In contrast, Player 4 in Round 1 accused Player 6 but in Round 3 cleared Player 1. Given my clearance of Player 4 in Round 3, his statement about \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal\u201d in Round 1 must be disregarded since he is not an Investigator. This is consistent with him possibly being the Lunatic.\n\u2022 Player 5, who is accused twice (by Player 6 in Round 1 and by Players 3 & 4 in Round 2, and again by Player 3 in Round 3), is our most frequent target. With multiple confirmed investigators (P1, P2, P3, P6) clearing everyone except P5, it points to Player 5 as the criminal. Even if P5 is the criminal, his own statements need not be truthful, and his \u201cclearing\u201d of Player 1 fits the pattern that criminals sometimes tell truths.\n\nThus, the assignments that best fit the cumulative rounds are:\n\u2022 Investigators (truthful): Players 1, 2, 3, and 6.\n\u2022 Criminal: Player 5.\n\u2022 Lunatic (whose statements are arbitrary): Player 4.\n\nAll statements across the rounds check out under these roles.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 5.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

With Investigators always telling the truth, the outlier statement by Player 5 is suspicious and may hint at the Lunatic role.

Review of Round 2:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Player 1 (me) said, \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Player 2 said, \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Player 3 said, \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Player 4 said, \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Player 5 said, \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Player 6 said, \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Here, four players (Players 1, 2, 4, and 6) assert that Player 5 is not the criminal. Given that investigators must speak truthfully, if any of those speakers (aside from myself as Criminal) are Investigators, then Player 5 really isn\u2019t the criminal.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Similarly, Players 3 and 5 affirm that Player 4 is not the criminal.\n\n4. Combined Analysis:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 From Round 1, multiple statements indicate that Players 3 and 6 are not the criminal, while Player 5\u2019s claim about Player 6 stands out as contradictory.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 From Round 2, consistent investigator testimony (assuming Players 2, 3, 4, and 6 are truthful) confirms that neither Player 4 nor Player 5 is the criminal.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Since there is only one criminal in the game and I (Player 1) already know I am the Criminal, the consistent truthful evidence from the alleged Investigators across both rounds supports that conclusion.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 The outlier statements (like those from Player 5 in Round 1) could be attributed to the lunatic\u2019s unpredictable behavior. In Round 2, however, even such players might coincidentally make a statement that aligns with truth.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 In summary, all truthful indicators (from presumed Investigators) point to the criminal not being among Players 3, 4, 5, or 6.

This rounds further confirms the consensus: assuming four investigators are always truthful, their statements narrow the possibilities, leaving Player 1 (myself) as the only candidate for criminal.\n\nReview of Round 3:\n\u2022 P1 (\u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal\u201d) \u2013 As Criminal, I may lie; this statement is false since the criminal is actually me.\n\u2022 P2 (\u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal\u201d) \u2013 True.\n\u2022 P3 (\u201cPlayer 1 is the criminal\u201d) \u2013 True, consistent with the fact.\n\u2022 P4 (\u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal\u201d) \u2013 True.\n\u2022 P5 (\u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal\u201d) \u2013 True.\n\u2022 P6 (\u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal\u201d) \u2013 True.\nOnce again, the Investigator statements in this round confirm that none of Players 2, 4, 5, or 6 is criminal.

His statement \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal\u201d is indeed true.\n\u2003\u2013 Now we must fill the roles: There are 4 Investigators, 1 Criminal, and 1 Lunatic.\n\u2003\u2003A consistent assignment would be:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003Investigators: Players 1, 2, 3, and 6.\n\u2003\u2003\u2003Criminal: Player 5.\n\u2003\u2003\u2003Lunatic: Player 4.\n\u2003\u2013 (Note that it would be equally possible for the lunatic to be assigned to a player even if his statement happens to agree with the truth \u2013 lunatics are not bound to lie or tell the truth.)\n\u2003\u2013 All statements check out:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Investigators\u2019 statements are truthful regarding who is or isn\u2019t the criminal.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 There is exactly one criminal (P5) and one lunatic (P4) in this assignment.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 In particular, P3\u2019s and P4\u2019s claims \u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal\u201d are exactly what truth\u2010tellers (if P3 is an Investigator) would say\u2014and even if one of them were the lunatic, the consistency of the other truth\u2010teller confirms P5.\n\nThis assignment is fully consistent with the rules.

Since I (Player 1) have stated \u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal\u201d which is the truth under this hypothesis, then I must be acting as a truth\u2010teller. Only Investigators always tell the truth.

Player 1 (me) says, \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal.\u201d Since I am an Investigator, this statement must be true. Thus, Player 3 is definitely not the criminal.\n\n2. Player 3 says, \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d That statement agrees with what we know (since I\u2019m not criminal), so if Player 3 is an Investigator his statement is true. (It\u2019s possible that Player 3 is not an Investigator, but his statement is correct anyway. Still, no conflict here.)\n\n3. Player 6 says, \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d Again, that is a true fact; if Player 6 were an Investigator his statement would be correct.\n\n4. Now consider Player 2\u2019s statement: \u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2022 If Player 2 is an Investigator, then this statement must be true and Player 5 is the criminal.  \n\u2003\u2022 Alternatively, if Player 2 were not an Investigator (that is, if he were the Criminal or Lunatic), his statement might be false. Let\u2019s set that possibility aside for now.\n\n5. Look at the conflicting statements by Players 4 and 5 about Player 6\u2019s status:  \n\u2003\u2022 Player 4 says, \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2022 Player 5 says, \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal.\u201d  \nSince Investigators always tell the truth, they cannot be in direct opposition. In any pair of contradictory statements, the one coming from an Investigator must be correct, which implies that at most one of these two (Player 4 or Player 5) can be an Investigator. At least one must be a non\u2010Investigator (either the Criminal or the Lunatic).\n\n6. Let\u2019s construct a scenario that fits the required role counts (4 Investigators, 1 Criminal, 1 Lunatic) and is consistent with all true statements coming only from Investigators:\n\n\u2003Scenario:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Assume Player 2 is an Investigator. Then his statement \u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal\u201d must be true. This implies Player 5 is the Criminal.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Since there is only 1 Criminal, and we\u2019ve now identified Player 5 as Criminal, all other players are either Investigators or the Lunatic.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 We already know Player 1, Player 3, and Player 6 can be Investigators (their statements check out). That\u2019s three.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 This leaves Player 4. Player 4\u2019s statement \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal\u201d is false (because Player 6 is an Investigator in this scenario). Therefore, Player 4 cannot be an Investigator and must be the Lunatic.\n\n7. Now verify all statements under this assignment:\n\u2003\u2022 Player 1 (Investigator) says \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal.\u201d True.\n\u2003\u2022 Player 2 (Investigator) says \u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal.\u201d True.\n\u2003\u2022 Player 3 (Investigator) says \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d True.\n\u2003\u2022 Player 4 (Lunatic) says \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal.\u201d (False, which is acceptable for a Lunatic.)\n\u2003\u2022 Player 5 (Criminal) says \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal.\u201d True \u2013 but a Criminal can choose to tell the truth or lie.\n\u2003\u2022 Player 6 (Investigator) says \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d True.\n\nThis assignment satisfies the counts (four Investigators: Players 1, 2, 3, 6; one Criminal: Player 5; one Lunatic: Player 4) and is consistent with the statements made in Round 2.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 5.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

P1 (Investigator) says \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d \n\u2003\u2003\u2192 Therefore, Player 5 cannot be the criminal.\n2. P2 says \u201cPlayer 1 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2003\u2192 Since I am not criminal, this statement is false. Because only Investigators speak truthfully, P2 must be either the Criminal or the Lunatic.\n3. P3 says \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d\n4. P4 says \u201cPlayer 3 is the criminal.\u201d\n5. P5 says \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal.\u201d\n6. P6 says \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\nAnalysis of Round 1 shows that Players 1, 3, 5, and 6 insist that someone (P5, P4, or P3) is not criminal. In fact, eliminating based on these truths, the only candidates left for being the criminal are Player 2 (who made a false accusation) and possibly Player 6. However, P6\u2019s statement (\u201cP4 is not the criminal\u201d) is what we\u2019d expect from an Investigator. A likely assignment from Round 1 is:\n\u2003\u2003P1: Investigator (given)\n\u2003\u2003P3, P5, P6: Investigators (statements are consistent)\n\u2003\u2003P2: Non\u2010Investigator (could be Criminal or Lunatic)\n\u2003\u2003P4: Non\u2010Investigator (since his statement contradicts the other investigators)\n\nBecause only one player can be the criminal and Players 1, 3, 5, and 6 seem to be telling truths, the criminal among the non\u2010Investigators must be either P2 or P4. Then, comparing statements, note that both P3 and P6 confirm that P4 is not the criminal. So Round 1 strongly suggests P2 as the only candidate for Criminal, with P4 being assigned the other non\u2010Investigator role (Lunatic).\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nRound 2 Review:\n1. P1 (Investigator) says \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal.\u201d (So, definitely P3 \u2260 criminal.)\n2. P2 says \u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2003\u2192 Since from Round 1 we know P5 is not criminal, and P2 is not an Investigator, this statement is false or misleading.\n3. P3 (Investigator) says \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d (Consistent with what we know.)\n4. P4 (non\u2010Investigator, likely our Lunatic) says \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal.\u201d\n5. P5 (Investigator) says \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal.\u201d\n6. P6 (Investigator) says \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\nIn this round the conflict is between P4 and P5 regarding Player 6. Since we are tentatively assigning P5 as an Investigator (and his statement is true), we maintain that Player 6 is not criminal. This round further reinforces that P2\u2019s statement is the odd one out. \n\nA consistent assignment for Round 2 that fits the count (4 Investigators, 1 Criminal, 1 Lunatic) is:\n\u2003\u2003P1, P3, P5, P6: Investigators\n\u2003\u2003P2: Criminal\u2003\u2003 (his false statement fits)\n\u2003\u2003P4: Lunatic\u2003\u2003   (non\u2010Investigator, and his misleading statement can be arbitrary)\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nRound 3 Review:\n1. P1 (Investigator) states \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2003\u2192 Since I tell the truth, Player 4 cannot be the criminal. (This is consistent with assigning P4 as Lunatic.)\n2. P2 (Criminal) says \u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2003\u2192 Since Player 5 is an Investigator, this statement is false, which suits the Criminal\u2019s goal of misleading.\n3. P3 (Investigator) says \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d\n4. P4 (Lunatic) says \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2003\u2192 Being Lunatic, P4\u2019s statement can be arbitrary; here it turns out false because we assign P2 as Criminal.\n5. P5 (Investigator) says \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d\n6. P6 (Investigator) says \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\nEvery statement in Round 3 is consistent with the assignment:\n\u2003\u2003P1, P3, P5, P6 as Investigators (all truthful)\n\u2003\u2003P2 as Criminal (statement is false)\n\u2003\u2003P4 as Lunatic (statement is permissible as either false or true)\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nConclusion:\nThe only assignment that is consistent across all rounds is:\n\u2003\u2003Player 1: Investigator (given)\n\u2003\u2003Player 2: Criminal\n\u2003\u2003Player 3: Investigator\n\u2003\u2003Player 4: Lunatic\n\u2003\u2003Player 5: Investigator\n\u2003\u2003Player 6: Investigator\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nFinal Judgment:\n\nFinal Criminal Is Player 2.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

Player 1 (me, an Investigator) states \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal.\u201d Being an Investigator, this must be true. So, Player 6 is not the criminal.\n2. Player 2 says \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal.\u201d If Player 2 is an Investigator (as his Round 1 statement about Player 5 being the criminal suggested), then this confirms that Player 3 is not the criminal.\n3. Player 3 says \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d As an Investigator (supported by his earlier statement), this tells us that Player 4 can\u2019t be the criminal.\n4. Player 4 says \u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal.\u201d Given our previous round we know from Player 1\u2019s statement that Player 2 is not the criminal. And if Players like 2 and 3 are Investigators, then this statement must be false. Since only Investigators always tell the truth, Player 4 must not be an Investigator. (Player 4 could be either the Lunatic or the Criminal.) But note that in Round 1 Player 4 said \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal,\u201d which is a true statement. Thus, Player 4\u2019s role is not locked down by truthfulness \u2013 only Investigators are 100% reliable.\n5. Player 5 (whom Round 1 strongly indicated to be the Criminal) says \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d Although coming from the Criminal, that statement happens to be true. Criminals can tell the truth or lie.\n6. Player 6 says \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d As Player 6 now appears to be consistent with other Investigators (and we already have Player 1 as Investigator), this statement is also true.\n\n[Combining Evidence:]\nFrom our combined analysis of Rounds 1 and 2, we see that:\n\u2022 My own and other reliable Investigators\u2019 statements all point away from Players 2, 3, 4, and 6 being the criminal.\n\u2022 Two reliable testimonies (from Players 2 and 3 in Round 1) pinpoint Player 5 as the criminal.\n\u2022 Player 4\u2019s assertion in Round 2 that \u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal\u201d is the only false claim among those we trust from the Investigators\u2014indicating that Player 4 is not one of them.

Player 5 says \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal.\u201d\n6. Player 6 says \u201cPlayer 3 is the criminal.\u201d\n\nRemember that the four Investigators always tell the truth (they hand down correct facts regarding who is, or isn\u2019t, the criminal). We have one Criminal (which is me) and one Lunatic among players 2\u20136.\n\nNotice that if we assume Players 2, 3, 4, and 5 are allotted the Investigator role, then each of their statements must be true. That yields:\n\u2022 From Player 2: Player 4 truly is not the criminal.\n\u2022 From Player 3 and Player 5: Player 2 truly is not the criminal.\n\u2022 From Player 4: Player 6 is not the criminal (meaning Player 6 isn\u2019t the criminal).\n\nBecause exactly one player is the criminal\u2014and I already know I am the criminal\u2014everyone saying \u201cX is not the criminal\u201d gives us consistent facts. Then consider Player 6\u2019s claim: \u201cPlayer 3 is the criminal.\u201d As an Investigator such a statement would have to be true; however, it conflicts with what the Investigators would see as true (since I am the criminal). Thus, Player 6 cannot be an Investigator but is instead the Lunatic. As a Lunatic, they believe they are a Criminal, and they are allowed to provide statements that may either be true or false. In this case, Player 6\u2019s statement is false.\n\nThus the roles that best explain these statements are:\n\u2022 Player 1: Criminal (me, as told)\n\u2022 Players 2, 3, 4, 5: Investigators (all statements made by them are true)\n\u2022 Player 6: Lunatic (statement can be arbitrary)\n\nSince the consistent picture is that I remain the Criminal, my final judgment for Round 1 is:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

As such, my statement \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal\u201d is truthful. Hence, Player 2 is not the criminal.\n\n2. Next, notice the two conflicting statements:\n\u2003\u2022 Player 3 says \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 Player 4 says \u201cPlayer 3 is the criminal.\u201d\nSince Investigators are always truthful, if one of these two is an Investigator then their accusation must be correct. However, both statements cannot be true simultaneously because there is only one Criminal. Consequently, exactly one of these two must be telling the truth (and is therefore an Investigator) while the other is not an Investigator\u2014and if the other is the Criminal, his statement can be arbitrary.\n\n3. Independent statements from Players 5 and 6 also say \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal,\u201d which reinforces what my own statement already guarantees.\n\n4. Considering the roles available (4 Investigators, 1 Criminal, and 1 Lunatic), a likely scenario is as follows. Since I (Player 1) and (most likely) Player 2 are Investigators, one of the conflicting pair (either Player 3 or Player 4) must be an Investigator (telling the truth) and the other must be the Criminal (able to lie). In such cases a common approach is to lean on the clear, direct accusation of one player by an assumed honest voice. Here it is natural to trust the accusation of one who, if honest, points directly to the other. By interpreting Player 3\u2019s statement as coming from an honest Investigator, his call that \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal\u201d is accepted as factual\u2014and Player 4\u2019s contrary claim is then seen as an effort to shift suspicion.\n\n5. (It is worth noting that an alternative consistent scenario exists if instead Player 4 were the honest Investigator accusing Player 3. However, given the balance of statements and the fact that my trusted statement about Player 2 (and those echoed by Players 5 and 6) leaves suspicion most squarely on the pair in conflict, the scenario in which Player 3 is truthful and Player 4 is the criminal appears more natural.)\n\nBased on the above reasoning, my best conclusion after Round 1 is as follows:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 4.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

Now, in Round 2, notice that Players 1, 2, and 4 (and also by implication Player 6, whose role is likely that of an Investigator) agree that Player 5 is not criminal. Meanwhile, Player 3 claims that Player 5 is criminal. \n\n\u2022 Here\u2019s the critical part:\n\u2003- If Player 3 were an Investigator, his Round 2 statement (\"Player 5 is the criminal\") would have to be true\u2014but that conflicts with my truthful statement (and that of others) saying Player 5 is not criminal.\n\u2003- Thus, Player 3 cannot be an Investigator. This makes it quite plausible that Player 3 is the one Criminal. \n\n\u2022 Let\u2019s test that possibility:\n\u2003\u2013 Suppose Player 3 is the Criminal.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Then in Round 1, his accusation \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal\u201d was a false diversion. \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 In Round 2, his statement \u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal\u201d is also false.\n\u2003\u2013 That would make Player 4\u2019s Round 1 accusation (that Player 3 is the criminal) truthful. \n\u2003\u2013 Meanwhile, the broad consensus from Players 1, 2, 4, and 6 (all likely Investigators) about the innocence of Player 5 further supports this picture.\n\u2003\u2013 Player 5\u2019s inaccurate accusation against me (Player 1) is then coming from the non\u2010Investigator side (and possibly fits the profile of the Lunatic, who believes they are Criminal).\n\nThis line of reasoning is completely consistent with the following assignment:\n\u2003\u2022 Investigators: Players 1, 2, 4, and 6.\n\u2003\u2022 Criminal: Player 3.\n\u2003\u2022 Lunatic: Player 5.\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\nFinal Judgment Based on Rounds 1 and 2:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 3.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

Since Investigators must tell the truth, if P2 were an Investigator then his statement would force the conclusion that I (Player\u00a01) am not the Criminal\u2014directly contradicting the role information given to me. \n\nGiven the role distribution (exactly 1 Criminal and exactly 1 Lunatic) and that I must stick with \u201cI am Criminal,\u201d there is no way to \u201csave\u201d P2\u2019s statement by assigning him to one of the free roles:\n\u2003\u2013 P2 cannot be the Criminal (that\u2019s me).  \n\u2003\u2013 If P2 were the Lunatic, then that would conflict with our strong Round\u00a01 signal that Player\u00a05 is Lunatic (because Player\u00a05\u2019s false statement couldn\u2019t come from an Investigator).  \n\u2003\u2013 Yet if P2 is an Investigator, his statement must be true\u2014and it isn\u2019t.\n\nThus, when combining Round\u00a01 and Round\u00a02 we face a clear inconsistency among the statements given the fixed information about my role.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nPossible Conclusions\n\nIn a perfect social deduction game the Investigators\u2019 statements are always truthful. The contradictory statement from Player\u00a02 in Round\u00a02 (\u201cPlayer\u00a01 is not the criminal\u201d) makes it impossible to reconcile all rounds under one consistent assignment:\n\u2003\u2022 If we assume Round\u00a01\u2019s signals (notably P5\u2019s false \u201cPlayer\u00a01 is not the criminal\u201d statement) are correct then P5 must be the Lunatic and P2 (along with P3, P4, P6) are the Investigators. But then P2\u2019s Round\u00a02 statement is impossible.  \n\u2003\u2022 Alternatively, if we try to \u201cfix\u201d Round\u00a02 by assigning P2 as non\u2010Investigator (i.e. Lunatic), then we lose the unique slot for Lunatic (since Round\u00a01 forces P5 into that role).\n\nThus, with the available statements from both rounds there is no assignment among the 6 players that respects the game\u2019s roles while also making all Investigator statements true.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nMy Final Judgment\n\nGiven that I have been told I am the Criminal, and despite the contradictory information arising in Round\u00a02 (which makes a fully consistent assignment impossible), I must commit to my role as given. The weight of the evidence still forces the identification of the Criminal as Player\u00a01 (myself). \n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nNote:\nThe contradiction\u2014namely Player\u00a02\u2019s false statement under an Investigator label\u2014suggests that not all rounds are internally consistent. In a well\u2010behaved game these inconsistencies would not occur. However, given the fixed role information I\u2019ve received and the requirement to provide a final judgment, I must conclude as above."

Since we know (by role information) that I am Criminal, any Investigator would truthfully say \u201cPlayer 1 is criminal\u201d if asked about my status. Instead, here four players (P2, P3, P4, and P6) claim that Player 1 is not the criminal; if any of them were honest Investigators, they would have to say the truth. This immediately creates a contradiction if we try to assign any of them as Investigators.\n\nIn contrast, Criminals and Lunatics are allowed to provide misleading or arbitrary statements. Yet since I am already the Criminal and exactly one Lunatic is present, it is impossible for four other players to make statements that are knowingly false (if they were truly Investigators).\n\nThus the statements in Round 3 are inconsistent with the expected roles. We face a game-wide contradiction across rounds that is not internally resolvable without violating the rule that Investigators always tell the truth.\n\nBecause I have been told I am the Criminal (and my identity cannot be changed even if the other statements are contradictory), I must trust this given role information despite the inconsistency.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

All their statements are consistent with the fact that I am the Criminal.\n\nBased on this analysis, my final judgment after Round 1 is:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

Player 4 states \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal.\u201d As with the others, if Player 4 is an Investigator this statement is true.\n\n5. Player 5 says \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d Since I know I am not the criminal and I trust my Investigator status, Player 5\u2019s assertion is in keeping with truth\u2014suggesting that Player 5 is likely among the Investigators.\n\n6. Player 6 says \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal.\u201d As before, if Player 6 is an Investigator, his statement would be true.\n\nNow let\u2019s consider the distribution of roles. There are 6 players with exactly 4 Investigators, 1 Criminal, and 1 Lunatic. Because I am an Investigator and it appears likely that Players 4 and 5 (and \u2013 depending on the reliability of his accusation \u2013 possibly Player 3) are in agreement with Investigator truths, we consider two scenarios:\n\nScenario A:\n\u2022 Assume that Player 3 is one of the Investigators. Then his clear, truthful statement \u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal\u201d indicates Player 2 is indeed the Criminal.\n\u2022 In this case the four Investigators become Players 1, 3, 4, and 5.\n\u2022 That leaves Player 2 as the Criminal and Player 6 as the Lunatic.\n\u2022 Checking the statements:\n\u2003\u2013 P1: \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal\u201d is true.\n\u2003\u2013 P2 (Criminal) says \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal.\u201d Although coming from the Criminal, this statement can be arbitrary\u2014even if it happens to be true.\n\u2003\u2013 P3 (Investigator) truthfully accuses \u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2013 P4 (Investigator) truthfully states \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2013 P5 (Investigator) truthfully states \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2013 P6 (Lunatic) states \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal,\u201d which is false\u2014acceptable in his role.\nThis scenario fits perfectly with our role counts and the nature of each role\u2019s statements.\n\nScenario B:\n\u2022 Alternatively, if we doubt Player 3\u2019s reliability and suppose he is not an Investigator (i.e. he is either the Criminal or the Lunatic), then the direct accusation against Player 2 loses its Investigator guarantee.\n\u2022 For example, if Player 2 were an Investigator and Player 3 were the Lunatic, then Player 2\u2019s statement \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal\u201d (true because a Lunatic is not the Criminal) remains consistent, but then who is the Criminal? Someone would have to be, and the statements do not support a strong candidate as clearly as in Scenario A.\n\u2022 Given that in Scenario B no reliable Investigator makes a direct accusation and we already count four Investigators, this scenario is less compelling.\n\nBecause exactly one Investigator (besides myself) stands out with a direct accusation\u2014and his truthfulness is required if he is indeed an Investigator\u2014I lean strongly toward Scenario A.\n\nFinal Judgment after Round 2:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 2.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

(Remember, the only non\u2013Investigator roles in this game are Criminal and Lunatic; since Player 2 is Criminal, Player 4 must be Lunatic.)\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nStep 3: Analyzing Round 3\n\nRound 3 statements are:\n\u2022 Player 1: \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal.\u201d As an Investigator, this is true.\n\u2022 Player 2: \u201cPlayer 1 is the criminal.\u201d (A criminal can lie; this is false.)\n\u2022 Player 3: \u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal.\u201d This aligns with my Round 2 statement.\n\u2022 Player 4: \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d (Even as a Lunatic, they could speak truthfully or falsely; here the statement is correct.)\n\u2022 Player 5: \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal.\u201d True if Player 5 is an Investigator.\n\u2022 Player 6: \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d True if Player 6 is an Investigator.\n\nRound 3\u2019s declarations are completely consistent with the assignment deduced in Round 2:\n\u2003\u2013 P1, P3, P5, and P6 as Investigator (truth-tellers),\n\u2003\u2013 P2 as Criminal,\n\u2003\u2013 P4 as Lunatic.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nFinal Conclusion\n\nAll three rounds combined point to a clear picture. As an Investigator, my own statements are truthful. Both my and Player 5\u2019s consistent claims pinpoint Player 2 as the criminal, while the set of truthful statements coming from Players 1, 3, 5, and 6 support that conclusion. Player 2\u2019s contrary claim and Player 4\u2019s incorrect statement align with their roles (Criminal and Lunatic, respectively).\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 2.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

One consistent possibility is as follows:\n\u2003\u2022 If Players 1, 2, 3, and 6 are Investigators then:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 P2\u2019s and P3\u2019s statements are truthful (so, P1 and P5 are not criminal).\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 P6 would then be saying \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal\u201d truthfully, so P4 is the criminal.\n\u2003\u2022 This leaves Player 5 to be the Lunatic (even though P5\u2019s statement \u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal\u201d is false it can be arbitrary given the Lunatic\u2019s nature).\n\n5. In the above hypothesis every Investigator\u2019s statement is true. In particular, P6\u2019s statement identifying P4 as the criminal would be reliable if P6 is an Investigator, and that is a strong indicator.\n\n6. Therefore based solely on Round 1 and the requirement that Investigator statements are always correct, the most consistent conclusion is that Player 4 is the criminal.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 4.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

Player 6 says \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d This is also true if we are the Criminal, so Player 6 is consistent with the role of an Investigator.\n\nThus, a consistent assignment based on Round 2 is:\n\u2022 Player 1: Criminal (our role, as given).\n\u2022 Player 2: Lunatic (because their false statement cannot be from an Investigator).\n\u2022 Players 3, 4, 5, and 6: Investigators.\n\nBased on this analysis for Round 2, I commit to the following final judgment:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

We are Player 1 and have been told our role is Criminal.\n\nRound 3 statements are as follows:\n\u2022 Player 1: \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2022 Player 2: \u201cPlayer 3 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2022 Player 3: \u201cPlayer 1 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2022 Player 4: \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2022 Player 5: \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2022 Player 6: \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\nAssuming our role (Player 1) is indeed Criminal, the actual criminal is Player 1. Let\u2019s check each statement under this assumption:\n\n1. Player 1 (Criminal) states \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2022 Since the criminal is Player 1, Player 4 is indeed not the criminal. As Criminal, we may choose to tell a truth or lie, so this statement is acceptable.\n\n2. Player 2 says \u201cPlayer 3 is the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2022 With Player 1 as the actual criminal, this statement is false. An Investigator would never state a falsehood; hence Player 2 is not an Investigator. (In previous rounds this pattern also pointed at Player 2 being our Lunatic.)\n\n3. Player 3 says \u201cPlayer 1 is the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2022 That is a true statement. It strongly indicates that Player 3 is an Investigator.\n\n4. Player 4 says \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2022 With Player 1 being the criminal, this claim is correct. Player 4\u2019s statement is consistent with being an Investigator.\n\n5. Player 5 says \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2022 Again, that is true under the assumption that Player 1 is criminal. This suggests Player 5 is an Investigator.\n\n6. Player 6 says \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2022 True as well. This fits the profile of an Investigator.\n\nThus, Round 3 remains fully consistent with the deduction that Player 1 is the only criminal; Player 2 is most likely the Lunatic (since their statement is false), and Players 3, 4, 5, and 6 are Investigators.\n\nBased on all rounds, my final judgment is:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."
