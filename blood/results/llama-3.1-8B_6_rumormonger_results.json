Since I am told I am the Criminal, and I am Player 1, I must be careful about my statement. However, as a Criminal, I might try to mislead others. If I were to say Player 4 is the Criminal, it would be a straightforward lie, but it could also be a clever way to make others doubt Player 4. However, given the nature of the game, it's more likely that I'm trying to protect myself or another Criminal, rather than accusing an innocent player. Therefore, this statement does not strongly indicate my role or the identity of the Criminal.\n\n2. **Player 2's statement**: Player 2 says Player 1 is the criminal. This statement directly accuses me, which is consistent with the role of an Investigator (or a Rumormonger, who believes they are an Investigator but may provide incorrect information). However, given that I am the Criminal, it's possible that Player 2 is trying to deceive others into believing I am the Criminal to clear their own name or to confuse the group. But, given the context, it's also possible that Player 2 genuinely believes they are an Investigator and made a mistake, or that they are a Rumormonger trying to spread misinformation.\n\n3. **Player 3's statement**: Player 3 says Player 4 is not the criminal. This statement does not directly involve me, so it doesn't give much away about my role. However, it does suggest that Player 3 is either an Investigator (who would be telling the truth) or a Rumormonger (who might be trying to deceive others about Player 4's innocence).\n\n4. **Player 4's statement**: Player 4 says Player 1 is the criminal. This statement directly accuses me, which, if I were to believe it, would mean I am indeed the Criminal. However, as the Criminal, I know I am not the Criminal, so this statement seems like a lie. It's likely that Player 4 is either a Rumormonger trying to spread false information or a Lunatic who believes they are the Criminal but is making statements that may or may not be true.\n\n5. **Player 5's statement**: Player 5 says Player 3 is not the criminal. This statement does not directly involve me, so it doesn't give much away about my role. However, it suggests that Player 5 is either an Investigator (who would be telling the truth) or a Rumormonger (who might be trying to deceive others about Player 3's innocence).\n\n6. **Player 6's statement**: Player 6 says Player 4 is not the criminal. This statement does not directly involve me, so it doesn't give much away about my role.

This could mean they are trying to deceive others, making them likely candidates for being the Rumormonger or the Lunatic.\n- **Player 1's, Player 3's, Player 5's, and Player 6's statements** all involve some level of ambiguity, making it difficult to pinpoint their roles with certainty.\n\nGiven the information, I will make a final judgment based on the most likely scenario:\n\n**Final Judgment:**\nFinal Criminal Is Player 2.\nMy Role Is Unknown.\n\nThis conclusion is based on the fact that Player 2's direct accusation of me could be a deliberate attempt to spread misinformation, aligning with the role of a Rumormonger.

However, considering the previous rounds, I lean towards Player 3 being a Lunatic.\n- Player 4 says Player 5 is not the criminal. This statement could be a self-defense from a Criminal (Player 5) or a false accusation from a Rumormonger (Player 2). However, considering the previous rounds, it's possible that Player 4 is a Lunatic.\n- Player 5 says Player 1 is not the criminal. This statement is consistent with being an Investigator, as Investigators provide truthful information about themselves.\n- Player 6 says Player 2 is not the criminal. This statement could be truthful from an Investigator or a Lunatic, or incorrect from a Rumormonger. However, considering the previous rounds, I lean towards Player 6 being an Investigator.\n\nBased on the analysis, my best guess is:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 4.\nMy Role Is Investigator.\n\nI'm more confident in this judgment because the statements from Players 1, 5, and 6 are consistent with being Investigators, and the statements from Player 2 and Player 6 are consistent with being a Rumormonger and an Investigator, respectively. However, the statement from Player 3 is inconsistent with being an Investigator, and the statement from Player 4 is inconsistent with being a Lunatic. Considering the previous rounds, I lean towards Player 4 being the Criminal."
