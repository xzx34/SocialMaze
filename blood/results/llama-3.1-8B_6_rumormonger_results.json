In that case, the Final Judgment would be different.\n\nLet me reevaluate the information. \n\nIf Player 3 is a Lunatic, then their statement that I am not the criminal is likely truthful. This means that Player 3 is trying to mislead the group by saying I am not the criminal, when in fact I am trying to say they are the criminal.\n\nGiven this new information, I will make the following judgment:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 3.\nMy Role Is Investigator.\n\nHowever, I still have some doubts about the roles of the other players.

If Player 3 is an Investigator, this statement would be truthful, but if Player 3 is a Lunatic, this statement could be false.\n- Player 4 says Player 3 is not the criminal. This statement could be from an Investigator, a Rumormonger, or a Lunatic. If Player 4 is an Investigator, this statement would be truthful. However, if Player 4 is a Rumormonger, this statement could be false.\n- Player 5 says Player 1 is not the criminal. Since I'm Player 1 and I know I'm an Investigator, this statement could be from a Rumormonger or a Lunatic. If Player 5 is a Rumormonger, this statement could be false.\n- Player 6 says Player 3 is not the criminal. This statement could be from an Investigator, a Rumormonger, or a Lunatic. If Player 6 is an Investigator, this statement would be truthful. However, if Player 6 is a Rumormonger or a Lunatic, this statement could be false.\n\nConsidering the statements, I'll make some preliminary observations:\n\n- If Player 3 is the Lunatic, Player 3's statement about Player 2 being the criminal would be false, and Player 4's statement about Player 3 not being the criminal would be true. However, Player 2's statement about Player 4 being the criminal would be false, and Player 6's statement about Player 3 not being the criminal would be true.\n- If Player 2 is the Rumormonger, Player 2's statement about Player 4 being the criminal would be false, and Player 3's statement about Player 2 being the criminal would be true.\n\nBased on these observations, I'm not confident in identifying the Criminal or my own role yet. I'll wait for more statements to refine my analysis.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Unknown.\nMy Role Is Unknown."
