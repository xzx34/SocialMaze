This could go either way since you are not bound to the truth.\n- Player 2 claims Player 3 is not the criminal. This statement could be from an Investigator, Rumormonger, or Lunatic.\n- Player 3 claims Player 6 is not the criminal. This statement also could come from any role and does not provide definitive information.\n- Player 4 and Player 5 both claim Player 3 is not the criminal. Since multiple players are saying the same thing about Player 3, if any of them are truthful, that could imply Player 3 is not the criminal.\n- Player 6 claims Player 4 is not the criminal. Again, this doesn't provide enough insight into who the criminal might be since Player 6 could be any role.\n\n**Considering that there are 4 Investigators and 1 Criminal, the majority of the statements could be true and point towards Player 3 being innocent. However, since there are still multiple roles that could influence the statements, it is hard to definitively identify the criminal.**\n\n**Conclusion for Round 1:**\nWe cannot determine the criminal with certainty yet, but Player 3 seems to be a strong candidate for being innocent given multiple corroborating statements.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player Unknown.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

Given that you know you are the Criminal, their statements are either truthful or misleading, depending on their roles.\n- Player 4 claims that Player 2 is not the criminal.

However, you know your role, and players accusing you could be targeting the actual criminal, which is the nature of the game.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

However, knowing your role as the Criminal, you must navigate this with the understanding that players might be misled or confused by the other roles in the game.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

This could indicate they are either Investigators or potentially a Rumormonger or Lunatic believing they are Investigators.\n- Players 1, 2, and 6 point towards Player 4 being the criminal.

This might reflect either an Investigator's truth or a Lunatic or Rumormonger\u2019s misleading statement.\n- Player 2 and Player 4 seem to be protecting others, while Player 5 and Player 6 also point away from Player 4 being the criminal.\n\nGiven that you are the Criminal, your statements might be attempting to confuse the other players. However, Player 6's consistency with previous rounds (saying Player 4 is not the criminal) could suggest they are an Investigator. \n\nConsidering the overall dynamics and the fact that Players 3 and 4 are making conflicting statements, we can tentatively conclude that the Criminal likely has to be one of the players still being pointed at, but you have to consider that you cannot be the Criminal since you are claiming others are innocent.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 3.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

(This statement is direct and if Player 2 is an Investigator or Rumormonger, it may hold weight.)\n3. **Player 3**: Claims Player 1 is the criminal.

This could be a tactic to mislead other players since you are the Criminal.\n- Players 2 and 3 both claim you are the Criminal, which reinforces the idea that they might be Investigators or Rumormongers. Their statements are consistent, which gives them credibility.\n- Player 4's statement about Player 6 being the criminal is new and needs to be weighed against the other statements.\n- Player 5's claim that Player 6 is not the criminal aligns with Player 6's own statement about Player 2.\n  \nBased on the statements, the following deductions can be made:\n\n- The consistency of Player 2 and Player 3's claims about you (Player 1) being the criminal suggests they are likely correct, especially since you are the Criminal.\n- Player 4's statement about Player 6 being the criminal contradicts with both Player 5 and Player 6's statements, suggesting Player 4 may be misled or lying.\n- The fact that you are the Criminal and are trying to deflect suspicion by saying Player 5 is not the criminal indicates that Player 5 may indeed be innocent based on the majority consensus against Player 6.\n\nGiven this analysis, I must conclude that the weight of the evidence points to you (Player 1) being the Criminal, as supported by the claims made by Players 2 and 3.\n\n### Final Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

Similar analysis as Player 4.\n6. **Player 6**: Claims Player 5 is not the criminal. This could be true or false depending on Player 6's role.\n\nFrom this round, we have the following points to consider:\n- My statement about Player 3 could just be an attempt to mislead.\n- Player 2 is making a strong claim that Player 3 is the criminal, which could either be true or a misdirection depending on Player 2's role.\n- Player 3's statement about Player 4 also adds to the suspicion of Player 4.\n- Players 4 and 5 both claim Player 6 is innocent, which again raises suspicion of Player 6 being innocent.\n- Player 6's statement about Player 5 does not provide much clarity.\n\nAt this point, we see conflicting statements about Players 3, 4, and 6. It\u2019s clear that Player 2 and Player 3 are accusing each other, which could mean one of them is likely the Criminal or a Lunatic.\n\nHowever, given that I am the Criminal and I have stated Player 3 is not the criminal, I have to consider that Player 2, who claims Player 3 is the criminal, could be more likely to be an Investigator than Player 3.

This is interesting because it contradicts the truth (as I am the Criminal), and if Player 6 is an Investigator, this statement would be false.\n\nNow, let\u2019s summarize the conflicting statements about Player 6:\n- Players 2 and 4 say Player 6 is not the criminal.\n- Player 3 claims Player 6 is the criminal.\n\nIf we consider Player 6's statement that I (Player 1) am not the criminal:\n- If Player 6 is telling the truth, they must be an Investigator, meaning I am not the Criminal, which contradicts my known role.\n- If Player 6 is lying, they could be either the Criminal or a Lunatic, which supports my claim that Player 5 is the criminal.\n\nPlayer 2's claim that Player 6 is not the criminal aligns with Players 4 and 5's statements. Thus, Player 5's claim about Player 2 being innocent might align them with the role of Investigator.\n\nGiven the conflicting statements, I will consider the following:\n- Player 3 is suspicious for accusing Player 6, and if they are a Lunatic, that claim could be false.\n- Player 6\u2019s claim about my innocence is suspicious, especially since I know I am the Criminal.\n\nI believe the most plausible criminal based on the statements in this round might be Player 3, considering their accusation against Player 6 and the conflicting statements from other players.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 3.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

This creates a strong case against Player 3 if any of those players are Investigators.\n- Player 3's claim that Player 4 is the criminal directly contradicts Player 4's statement about Player 3.\n\nConsidering the previous rounds:\n- In Round 2, Player 4 and Player 5 had conflicting statements, indicating one of them might be lying.\n- In Round 3, the consistent claims by Players 2, 4, 5, and 6 against Player 3 suggest that they may collectively be truthful about Player 3's role.\n- Player 3\u2019s assertion that Player 4 is the criminal does not hold up against the majority's statements, which imply that Player 3 is likely the criminal.\n\nBased on the analysis of all three rounds, it seems most plausible that Player 3 is indeed the criminal, as they are contradicted by multiple players who have no reason to lie if they are Investigators.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 3.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

If Player 3 were the criminal, then Player 2 could be the Investigator, but since you are the confirmed criminal, Player 2's statement cannot be validated with certainty.\n- Players 3, 4, and 6 all agree that Player 3 is not the criminal. If Player 3 were the Lunatic, then they could believe they were criminal, and thus their statement could be misleading. However, since you are the criminal, Player 3 cannot be the criminal.\n- Player 5's statement about Player 4 not being the criminal does not provide clarity since we still have conflicting claims.\n  \nGiven the statements, we can conclude:\n\n- Player 2 is likely an Investigator, as they correctly identify Player 3 as a potential criminal.\n- Players 3, 4, and 6 seem to be corroborating each other about Player 3's innocence, but we cannot definitively determine their roles without more context.\n\nOverall, the situation remains complex, but we can ascertain that Player 1 (you) is the Criminal.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

This indicates that Player 6 is likely either a Rumormonger or Lunatic.\n\nGiven the information:\n\n- Players 2, 3, and 5 all say Player 6 is not the Criminal, reinforcing the idea that Player 6 is likely safe from that label.\n- Player 4 claims Player 2 is also not the Criminal, which could mean that the guilty party is among Players 1, 4, or potentially Player 6, despite the majority labeling Player 6 as innocent.\n\nYou are aware that you are the Criminal, and Player 6's claim about you is false. Therefore, it seems Player 1 cannot be the Criminal according to Player 6.\n\nAs a result, the most likely conclusion at this point is:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

This suggests Player 2 could be lying. Thus, Player 2 might be a Lunatic or Rumormonger.\n\n- Player 3 says Player 2 is not the Criminal, which is an attempt to protect Player 2. If Player 3 were an Investigator, Player 2 would be innocent. However, if Player 2 is indeed lying, then Player 3 is either mistaken or misleading.\n\n- Player 4 also states that you (Player 1) are not the Criminal, which is another contradiction since you know your role. This indicates that Player 4 might be a Lunatic or Rumormonger.\n\n- Player 5 claims Player 6 is not the Criminal, which could be true or false. If Player 5 is an Investigator, then Player 6 is not the Criminal.\n\n- Player 6\u2019s statement about you not being the Criminal is again a contradiction, adding to the uncertainty surrounding their role.\n\nGiven the statements across all three rounds, we can deduce the following:\n\n- Players 2, 4, and 6 are all claiming you are not the Criminal, which is impossible since you know your role is Criminal. Therefore, at least one of these players must be misleading others.\n- The consistency from Players 2 and 4 in claiming you are innocent suggests they might be either Lunatics or Rumormongers.\n- Since you are the Criminal, any claim that you are innocent must be false, meaning Players 2, 4, and 6 are likely not Investigators.\n\nSince you are aware of your role as Criminal, and given all this information, it seems that the strongest claim about the Criminal could still lead back to Player 1 (yourself) based on the contradictions presented by others.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

If either one of them is an Investigator, that would suggest Player 2 is likely a Rumormonger or Lunatic.\n\nSince I have consistently identified Player 5 as the criminal from the first round, and there hasn't been any new evidence contradicting that, I will stick to my conclusion.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 5.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

This is aligned with my own statement and could be true.\n6. **Player 6**: Says I (Player 1) am not the criminal. This is true, reaffirming my role as Investigator.\n\nAnalysis:\n- My statement about Player 4 being innocent is consistent with my claim as an Investigator.\n- Player 2 continues to make allegations against other players, which raises suspicion about their role.\n- Player 3's statement about Player 4 also supports my claim, but Player 4's defense of Player 2 is questionable.\n- Player 5's alignment with my assertion about Player 4 increases their credibility.\n- Player 6's statement reinforces my innocence.\n\nBased on all three rounds, I have consistently pointed to Player 2 as a likely candidate for the criminal role due to their misleading statements and alignment with the Lunatic or Rumormonger behavior.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 2.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

If Player 4 is truthful, then Player 2 is indeed the criminal, but that contradicts Player 2\u2019s and Player 6\u2019s claims.\n- Player 5's statement about Player 4 not being the criminal is interesting because if Player 4 is indeed the criminal, then Player 5 would be providing false information, potentially indicating that Player 5 is either a Rumormonger or the Lunatic.\n- Finally, Player 6\u2019s assertion that you are the criminal can only be false because you are confirmed as an Investigator.\n\nNow, let's summarize the implications:\n- You are confirmed not to be the criminal.\n- Players 3 and 5 are also confirmed not to be the criminal (you confirmed Player 5, and Player 3 confirmed Player 5).\n- Player 4 claims Player 2 is the criminal, but we cannot confirm if this is true or false since Player 2 claims Player 4 is not the criminal. \n- Player 6's assertion that you are the criminal is false, which means Player 6 might be the criminal or the Lunatic.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we still cannot definitively conclude who the criminal is, but we can deduce more about the players based on their statements and conflicts.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player Unknown.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

However, if Player 5 is innocent, at least one of Players 2 and 3 must be lying.\n- Player 4's defense of Player 6 does not directly implicate Player 5.\n\nAt this point, Player 5 is the most implicated by two statements (from Players 2 and 3).

If Player 2 is an Investigator, this would be true, but if Player 2 is the Criminal or a Lunatic, it could be false.\n- **Player 3**: Says Player 2 is not the criminal. If Player 3 is an Investigator, then Player 2 is indeed not the criminal. If Player 3 is the Lunatic, their statement could be random.\n- **Player 4**: Says Player 3 is not the criminal. Same reasoning as above applies.\n- **Player 5**: Claims Player 4 is not the criminal. If Player 5 is the Criminal or Lunatic, this could be false.\n- **Player 6**: Says Player 3 is not the criminal.

Thus, Player 2 is likely not an Investigator.\n\nIf we assume Player 5 is indeed not the criminal (as per your statement), then Player 2 is likely the Criminal or a Lunatic, and Players 3, 4, and 6 might be Investigators. \n\nHowever, Player 3's statement about Player 2 not being the criminal contradicts the notion of Player 2 being a potential Criminal.\n\nGiven the conflicting statements and the fact that you are the Criminal, you need to consider that Players 3, 4, and 6 could all be Investigators or that at least one of them is a Rumormonger or Lunatic. \n\nSince the only consistent observation is that Player 2's statement about Player 5 directly contradicts your own statement, Player 2 is likely the Criminal or a Lunatic. This suggests Player 3, who supports Player 2, is not likely to be an Investigator.\n\nThrough elimination, Player 5 might be the Investigator who supports Player 4, which indicates Players 4 and 6 might also be Investigators.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 2.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

This statement doesn't provide direct evidence of Player 2's role but is consistent with the idea that Player 2 could be an Investigator, Rumormonger, or Lunatic.\n- **Player 3**: Claims Player 2 is not the criminal. This statement could be from an Investigator (making it true) or could be false from a Rumormonger or Lunatic.\n- **Player 4**: Also claims Player 2 is not the criminal, again potentially as an Investigator.\n- **Player 5**: Claims Player 3 is the criminal. This is a direct accusation and would be a significant move if Player 5 is an Investigator.\n- **Player 6**: Claims Player 2 is not the criminal, consistent with the statements from Players 3 and 4.\n\nNow, looking at the statements collectively:\n\n1. If Player 2 is truly not the criminal (as stated by Players 3, 4, and 6), then their claims are likely from Investigators, aligning them against you. \n2. Since you, as the Criminal, said Player 5 is the criminal, if Player 5 is not the criminal, that makes your statement false, which aligns with your role.\n3. Player 5\u2019s accusation against Player 3 may also be misleading or false, especially if Player 5 is the Criminal or a Lunatic.\n\nGiven that multiple players are claiming Player 2 is not the criminal, this suggests a strong consensus against Player 2, making them likely innocent. \n\nHowever, your statement about Player 5 being the criminal introduces doubt. If you are the Criminal, then your statement about Player 5 being the criminal cannot be true if Player 5 is indeed innocent.\n\nAt this point, the more reliable consensus seems to be that Players 2, 3, 4, and 6 are not the criminals, while Player 5 is likely to be identified as the criminal based on your statement and Player 5's accusation against Player 3.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 5.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

Player 4's statement about Player 3 not being the criminal contradicts your statement that Player 3 is the criminal. This contradiction suggests that either you are lying (as the Criminal), or Player 4 (if truthful) is correct.\n3. Player 5 saying Player 2 is not the criminal further strengthens the idea that Player 2 is likely innocent.\n4. Player 6\u2019s statement that you are not the criminal is false since you know you are the Criminal.\n\nFrom the statements analyzed, it appears that both Players 2 and 3 are consistent in claiming Player 4 is not the criminal, which aligns with the notion that they may be Investigators. Player 4's claim about Player 3 not being the criminal contradicts your claim.\n\nGiven this evidence, we can deduce that:\n- Player 1 (You) is indeed the Criminal.\n- Players 2, 3, and 4 seem to align in their statements, indicating they are likely Investigators.\n- Player 5's role remains ambiguous but doesn't seem to conflict with the other players' statements.\n\nSince you've accused Player 3, but Player 4 counters that, it indicates that Player 3 is likely innocent. Your role as Criminal means that your statement is likely false.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 3.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

If Player 2 is an Investigator, this would be a truthful statement. If Player 2 is a Rumormonger or Lunatic, this could be misleading.\n- Player 3 supports your claim (Player 1) by stating that Player 4 is the criminal. If Player 3 is an Investigator, this adds credence to your statement.\n- Player 4 claims Player 6 is the criminal. If this is true, it contradicts Player 2's statement about Player 6, which raises questions about the validity of Player 4's role.\n- Player 5 states Player 2 is not the criminal. If true, this would suggest Player 2 is likely an Investigator, but if Player 5 is a Rumormonger or Lunatic, it could be misleading.\n- Player 6 claims Player 3 is not the criminal. If Player 6 is telling the truth, it would mean Player 3 is not the Criminal, but if Player 6 is a Lunatic or Rumormonger, this could also be misleading.\n\nFrom the statements, we observe the following:\n- Players 1 and 3 agree that Player 4 is the criminal, which strengthens the case against Player 4.\n- Player 2's claim about Player 6 not being the criminal contradicts Player 4's claim that Player 6 is the criminal. This inconsistency raises doubts about Player 4's truthfulness.\n- Player 5's statement about Player 2 not being the criminal does not help clarify Player 4's status and might suggest Player 2 could be an Investigator if true.\n- Player 6's statement about Player 3 not being the criminal supports the idea that Player 3 may be telling the truth.\n\nGiven that both you (Player 1) and Player 3 are claiming Player 4 is the criminal, and Player 4 is making a contradictory claim about Player 6, it strongly indicates that Player 4 is indeed the Criminal.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 4.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

This could indicate that they are Investigators or that Player 5 is indeed the criminal. However, since you (Player 1) know you are the Criminal, you are trying to mislead the others.\n- Player 5 accuses Player 4, which could be a distraction from themselves.\n- Players 3 and 6 both state that Player 4 is not the criminal. Since they agree on this point, it adds some credibility to their statements about Player 4.\n\nGiven that you are aware of your role as the Criminal, the primary goal is to mislead the other players. Thus, the consensus around Player 5 being the criminal could suggest that player might actually be the Investigator or a Rumormonger who has mistakenly believed they are an Investigator.\n\nA few scenarios could arise:\n- If Player 5 is indeed the Criminal, then Players 1, 2, and 4 are either Investigators or Rumormongers incorrectly accusing Player 5.\n- If Player 4 is actually the Criminal, then Player 5's claim could either be a Lunatic's false accusation or a Criminal's attempt to divert suspicion.\n\nSince Players 3 and 6 both state Player 4 is not the criminal, they might be Investigators or Rumormongers. However, their joint statement reinforces the idea that Player 4 is likely an Investigator.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAfter analyzing the statements, I feel the most confident that Player 5 is likely the Criminal due to the majority consensus against them and the support from Player 3 and Player 6 regarding Player 4. \n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 5.\nMy Role Is Criminal."
