Recall:\n\n\u2022 There are exactly 4 Investigators (always truthful), 1 Criminal (may lie or tell the truth), and 1 Rumormonger (who believes they are an Investigator but may give false information).\n\u2022 I (Player\u202f1) know I am an Investigator and must tell the truth.\n\nThe Round 2 statements are:\n\n\u2003\u2013 Player 1: \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal.\u201d (Truthful.)\n\u2003\u2013 Player 2: \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal.\u201d \n\u2003\u2013 Player 3: \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2013 Player 4: \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2013 Player 5: \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2013 Player 6: \u201cPlayer 1 is the criminal.\u201d\n\nBecause I must be truthful, my statement fixes that Player 6 is not criminal. Also, an Investigator\u2019s statement must always be correct. That forces any statement that is factually false to come from either the Criminal or the Rumormonger.\n\nLet\u2019s mark which utterances turn out false if we assume consistency:\n\n\u2003\u2022 By my statement, Player 6 is not the criminal.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 So Player 2\u2019s statement (\u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal\u201d) is false.\n\u2003\u2022 I know I am not criminal; so Player 6\u2019s statement (\u201cPlayer 1 is the criminal\u201d) is false.\n\u2003\u2022 Players 3, 4, and 5 say \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal.\u201d For those statements to be true (if uttered by an Investigator) Player 2 would have to be innocent.\n  \nThus a natural first attempt is to assign the four Investigators to Players 1, 3, 4, and 5. That would force Players 2 and 6 to be non\u2010Investigators (one Criminal and one Rumormonger). In that scenario:\n\u2003\u2013 My (Player\u202f1) statement is correct.\n\u2003\u2013 As Investigators, Players 3, 4, and 5 are telling the truth \u2013 so Player 2 would not be the criminal.\n\u2003\u2013 That means the criminal would have to be Player 6.\n\u2003\u2013 However, my statement (\u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal\u201d) then becomes false.\n\u2003\nIf instead we try switching the roles (so that Player 2 is the criminal and Player 6 is the Rumormonger) then:\n\u2003\u2013 My \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal\u201d remains true.\n\u2003\u2013 Players 3, 4, and 5 as Investigators would (truthfully) say \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal\u201d \u2013 which contradicts Player 2 being the criminal.\n\u2003\nNo matter how one assigns the single Criminal and single Rumormonger to the only two players (2 and 6) not already fixed as Investigators by virtue of a correct statement (since a false statement cannot come from an Investigator), a contradiction results. In one case the falsehood in Player 2\u2019s or Player 6\u2019s statement forces us into inconsistency with the truth told by the three others.\n\nIn summary, under the assumption that four players must be Investigators (and thus always tell the truth), the collection of Round 2 statements cannot be reconciled with exactly one Criminal and exactly one Rumormonger. \n\nBecause of this internal inconsistency, I cannot confidently designate a final Criminal based solely on the Round 2 statements. However, I do know (by the game\u2019s instructions) that my role is Investigator.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Unknown.\nMy Role Is Investigator. "

No assignment of exactly 1 Criminal, 4 Investigators and 1 Rumormonger makes all the \u201ctruth\u2010by\u2010Investigator\u201d statements come out correctly. (For example, if one tries to \u201cpin\u201d the criminal on Player\u00a03 to satisfy Player\u00a06\u2019s Round\u00a02 claim then a couple of speakers who we expect to be investigators end up having to say false things; if one picks another player the discrepancy shows up elsewhere.) \n\nBecause the rounds\u2019 statements are mutually conflicting, even after three rounds I cannot pinpoint the guilty party with confidence. \n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player Unknown.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

In Round 2 I stated, \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal.\u201d (Truthfully, according to my knowledge, that would mean Player 6 is indeed the criminal.)\n\n2. Now let\u2019s check the other Round 2 statements with that in mind:\n\u2003\u2022 Player 2 says \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal.\u201d If Player 6 really is the criminal, then this statement is false. (Because an Investigator must always tell the truth, Player 2 cannot be an Investigator here. He might be the Rumormonger\u2014who sometimes makes false statements\u2014or (if he were the Criminal, he could say anything). But since my role is fixed as Investigator\u2014leaving only one Criminal role which I am not\u2014it appears Player 2 must be the Rumormonger if we try to reconcile his false statement.)\n\u2003\u2022 Player 3 says \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal.\u201d Under the assumption that Player 6 is criminal, this statement is false. Hence, Player 3 cannot be a truthful Investigator.\n\u2003\u2022 Player 4 says \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal.\u201d That is also false (if we trust my statement), so Player 4 also cannot be an Investigator.\n\u2003\u2022 Player 5 says \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal.\u201d That again is false if Player 6 is criminal.\n\u2003\u2022 Player 6 (whom I trust not, since under my assumption he is criminal) says \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d That statement is true regardless\u2014but as the Criminal, Player 6 is free to tell truth or lie.\n\n3. At this point a puzzle appears: There must be exactly 4 Investigators, 1 Criminal, and 1 Rumormonger. I already know my role (Investigator) and if I accept my own unmistakably truthful statement then Player 6 is the Criminal. That leaves Players 2, 3, 4, and 5. However, all four of these players made statements that are false if we assume Player 6 is indeed the Criminal. (Since only non\u2010Investigators are allowed to give false statements\u2014and there is only one Rumormonger among the four remaining slots\u2014the fact that four players would be giving false claims seems inconsistent with the structure of roles.)\n\n4. In a logically consistent game the pool of remaining players would have three truth\u2010tellers (Investigator) who always state the truth and one Rumormonger (who may be wrong). Here, accepting my truth leads to four players (P2, P3, P4, and P5) making false statements in Round 2\u2014a distribution that cannot happen given the rules.\n\n5. Faced with this contradiction, my analysis must decide what to trust. I must never doubt my own knowledge since I am told (and know) that I\u2019m an Investigator. (Investigators cannot lie.) Therefore, my Round 2 statement \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal\u201d must be taken as fact even though the other statements, taken together, force an impossible pattern if everyone were playing their designated roles faithfully.\n\n6. In games of social deduction sometimes one round\u2019s statements turn out to be misleading or inconsistent due to confused or intentionally deceptive behavior by non\u2010Investigator roles. Although the Round 2 claims as a whole are not internally consistent with the fixed role counts, the only piece of information I can be absolutely sure of is my own truthful word.\n\nGiven that I must commit to a final judgment based on my role as a truthful Investigator, I must stand by my own statement even though the other rounds appear messy once combined with role constraints.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 6.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

Yet over the three rounds the information appears to point at different suspects. In a live game new evidence sometimes forces an updated judgment, and my final belief must reflect what I now know.)\n\nLet me summarize the rounds briefly with respect to a single true criminal (only one of Players 2\u20136 may be criminal, and I (Player 1) am not):\n\n\u2022 In Round 1 I said, \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal.\u201d (Truthful, so the criminal is not Player 2.) Other players\u2019 Round\u202f1 remarks included claims that either Player 5 or Player 4 is criminal.\n\u2022 In Round 2 I stated, \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal.\u201d (Being an Investigator, that statement was meant to be true at the time.) However, in that round several others (P2 and P4, for example) said \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal\u201d while two other voices (P3 and P5) accused Player\u202f4.\n\u2022 In Round 3 I declared, \u201cPlayer 3 is the criminal.\u201d At the same time the other five players all make statements clearing one or two people (e.g. P2, P3, and P4 each say \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal\u201d while P5 and P6 clear Player\u202f2).\n\nThe three rounds cannot all be simultaneously true if we require exactly one criminal. (For example, my Round 2 and Round 3 claims would force two different players to be criminal.) Because I must always speak truthfully as an Investigator, I must now update my final judgment based on the best evidence available\u2014that is, the latest round information as well as the consistent patterns emerging from the other players in Round 3. Notice that in Round 3 no one accuses Players 4, 5, or 6; instead, aside from my statement, everyone is saying that Players 2 and 6 are not the criminal. (Round\u202f3 therefore narrows the suspect list to among Players 3, 4, or 5.) My most recent and current evidence (as an Investigator) is the statement \u201cPlayer 3 is the criminal.\u201d\n\nWhile I recognize there was some conflict with my earlier rounds, I must give my final decision based on my current analysis. (In a live game, I might later explain that new evidence forced me to update my hypothesis.) \n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 3.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

          "response": "Let\u2019s go through the round\u2010by\u2010round thinking for Round 1.\n\nStep 1. We know for sure that I (Player 1) am an Investigator. As an Investigator I always tell the truth. My statement was \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal.\u201d That statement must be true. (Note that an Investigator\u2019s statement is never mistaken.)\n\nStep 2. Accepting Player 1\u2019s statement as true tells us that Player 6 is indeed the Criminal.\n\nStep 3. Now, by the game\u2019s roles there should be exactly four Investigators, one Criminal, and one Rumormonger in the game. In a perfect world we\u2019d have three additional Investigators besides myself. Investigators must never say anything false. Let\u2019s check the other claims:\n\u2003\u2022 Player 2 says \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal.\u201d Given our accepted fact, that statement is false. Hence Player 2 cannot be one of the truth\u2010telling Investigators. (Player 2 must be either the Criminal or the Rumormonger.) But the Criminal role is already taken by Player 6, so Player 2 must be the Rumormonger.\n\u2003\u2022 Player 4 also says \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal.\u201d This is likewise false. In a minimal world there would now be two players (Players 2 and 4) giving a false statement. However, only one Rumormonger exists and the Criminal is already taken as Player 6.\n\u2003\u2022 The remaining players make statements that are consistent with Player 6 being the Criminal. For example, Player 3\u2019s \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal\u201d is true (since Player 2 is not the Criminal) and Player 5 says \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal,\u201d which is also true. (Player 6 even says \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal,\u201d and that is correct.)\n\nStep 4. The problem is that two players (Players 2 and 4) appear to have made false statements. Since only one non\u2010Investigator aside from the Criminal is allowed (the Rumormonger) and we already have a Criminal (Player 6), there is a tension here. One possibility is that one of these two non\u2010Investigators somehow happened to make a false statement, even though they\u2019re not forced to lie; after all, the Criminal and Rumormonger are free agents and may sometimes end up stating false things. (Both the Criminal and Rumormonger are \u201callowed\u201d to say things that turn out false.) However, when lying they cannot \u201csimulate\u201d being a fully truthful Investigator.\n\nStep 5. Given that I know I am an Investigator and that my statement must be true, my conclusion for Round 1 is that Player 6 is the Criminal. (There remains some uncertainty as to which one of Players 2 and 4 is the Rumormonger, but that is not part of the final judgment format requested.)\n\nTherefore, after Round 1 my best judgment is:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 6.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

P4 makes multiple accusations (claiming P2 is criminal twice and P6 in another round) that conflict with my truthful statements. Such behavior is expected from the criminal, who can lie or mix truth with lies.\n4. P5 is inconsistent\u2014while mostly affirming that P5 is not criminal (from rounds 1 and 2) the contradictory statement in Round 3 about P2 being criminal suggests unreliability. Given there is exactly one Rumormonger who may be mistaken, P5\u2019s contradictory statements point to that role.\n5. With 4 Investigators required in the game, aside from me, Players 2, 3, and 6 are consistent and likely the genuine Investigators.\n\nThus, the only role that fits the pattern of deceptive and inconsistent statements is Player 4, which aligns with my direct statement that P4 is criminal.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 4.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

Let\u2019s review the key statements that come from players who have consistently provided information that fits a truthful pattern:\n\u2003\u2022 From Rounds 1 and 2, Players 3, 4, and 6 have all made statements (e.g., \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal,\u201d \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal,\u201d \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal\u201d) that align with what we would expect from Investigators.\n\u2003\u2022 In Round 3, Player 3 says \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal\u201d and Player 6 adds \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal.\u201d These are consistent with our earlier conclusions.\n\u2003\u2022 Most importantly, in Round 3, Player 4 proclaims \u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal.\u201d Since Player 4\u2019s previous statements are in line with truth, we can reasonably trust that Player 4 is an Investigator\u2014and that his accusation is correct.\n\n3. Across the rounds, the statements have consistently cleared Players 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 of being the criminal. For example:\n\u2003\u2022 In Round 1, Players 3, 4, and 6 provided statements that point away from Players 1 and 2.\n\u2003\u2022 In Round 2, both Players 3 and 4 declared that Player 6 is not the criminal, further narrowing the possibilities.\n\u2003\u2022 In Round 3, my statement along with those of Players 2, 3, and 5 confirm that Player 2 is not the criminal.\n\n4. Given there is only one Criminal and four actors genuinely (or effectively) providing Investigator\u2010like truth in the rounds, the only remaining candidate is Player 5. Although Player 5\u2019s statements have been mixed (in Round 1, his statement \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal\u201d happens to be true, but in Round 2 he wrongly claims \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal\u201d), this inconsistency fits the pattern of the Criminal (or possibly the Rumormonger) who can sometimes make true statements and sometimes false ones. However, since multiple consistent statements by truthful Investigators point to Player 5 being the criminal\u2014and the pattern of information has never implicated any other player\u2014Player 5 is the best candidate for the Criminal role.\n\n5. Taking all rounds into account, the evidence strongly indicates that:\n\u2003\u2013 The four Investigators appear to be Players 1, 3, 4, and 6.\n\u2003\u2013 The Rumormonger must then be Player 2.\n\u2003\u2013 And Player 5 is the Criminal.\n\nTherefore, my final judgment after Round 3 is:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 5.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

Player 6 said \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal.\u201d If Player 6 were a genuine Investigator, then Player 2 indeed cannot be criminal.\n\nGiven we know the overall assignment is 4 Investigators, 1 Criminal (me) and 1 Rumormonger, and knowing that only pure Investigators are strictly truthful, the two accusations (from Players 3 and 4) point squarely at me. The remaining statements (from Players 2, 5, and 6) are all consistent with the possibility that I am the Criminal. They could be coming from genuine Investigators or from the Rumormonger (who might occasionally give incorrect information\u2014but in this case, they happen to align with the truth).\n\nThus, based solely on Round 1 statements, the most consistent conclusion is that I (Player 1) am indeed the Criminal. In other words, the majority of claims (especially those from Players 3 and 4 that must be truthful if they are genuine Investigators) support that identification.\n\nFinal Judgment after Round 1:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

Since I, an Investigator, stated that \u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal\u201d in Round 2\u2014and given that Investigators always tell the truth\u2014we must conclude that Player 5 is indeed the Criminal.\n\nWith Player 5 as the Criminal, Player 4 must be the Rumormonger. (Rumormongers believe they are Investigators and may give incorrect information, which fits with Player 4\u2019s conflicting statement in Round 2 regarding Player 6.)\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nStep 4.

In that case, neither Player 3 nor Player 6 can be the criminal.\n\n2. Given that I know I am the Criminal and there is exactly one criminal, all Investigator statements must indicate that the suspected criminal is not one of them (or someone falsely claimed to be criminal by someone not an Investigator).

Looking at Player 3\u2019s statement: \"Player 4 is the criminal.\" If Player 3 were an Investigator, this statement would be true, but it conflicts with the presumptive consistency of the other Investigators (because we already have me, Player 1, as the sole criminal).

It reinforces the idea that none of the other players are the criminal.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 The evidence points toward the criminal being Player 1 (myself).\n\nConclusion:\nThe consistency among the Investigator statements (from Players 2, 4, 5, and 6) confirms that neither Player 3, Player 4, nor Player 6 is the criminal. Since I know I am the Criminal, Player 3\u2019s false statement marks them as the Rumormonger while the others remain Investigators.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

I have been told I am an Investigator, and as an Investigator my statements must always be truthful. (Note: In Round 1 I declared \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal\u201d while in Round 2 I assert \u201cPlayer 3 is the criminal.\u201d Since there is only one criminal in the game, both rounds together imply a contradiction. However, because each round\u2019s statements are meant to be reconsidered as new information comes in, I must update my judgment based on the cumulative evidence\u2014even if that forces me to revise a prior conclusion.)\n\nConsidering Round 2 statements alone, here is the breakdown:\n\n1. Player 1 (myself, Investigator) states: \u201cPlayer 3 is the criminal.\u201d As I must tell the truth, I must now conclude that \u2013 based on current, cumulative evidence \u2013 Player 3 is indeed the criminal.\n\n2. Player 2 says \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 If Player 2 is an Investigator (or even a Rumormonger mistaken about the fact), his statement is consistent with Player 3 being the criminal.\n\n3. Player 3 (whom I now identify as the criminal) says \u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 As the criminal, Player 3 may attempt to mislead and his statement is unreliable.\n\n4. Player 4 states \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 This statement is consistent with Player 3 being criminal if Player 4 is indeed a truthful Investigator.\n\n5.

In games like this, as new rounds provide additional information, initial beliefs may need to be revised. Based on Round 2\u2019s cumulative evidence, I now firmly conclude that the criminal is Player 3.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 3.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

(Remember that I, Player 1, know I am an Investigator, so my statement must be true.)\n\nHere are the Round 2 statements:\n\u2003\u2022 Player 1 (me): \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal.\u201d (As Investigator, this must be true.)\n\u2003\u2022 Player 2: \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d (That is true if I am indeed not criminal.)\n\u2003\u2022 Player 3: \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 Player 4: \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 Player 5: \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 Player 6: \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\nBecause I am an Investigator, my statement forces Player 6 to be the criminal. Given that there is exactly one criminal, this assignment means:\n\u2003\u2022 Player 6 is Criminal.\n\u2003\u2022 All Investigators must tell the truth, so any Investigator\u2019s statement must agree with \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 The non\u2010Investigator players (the Rumormonger in our game\u2014the one who believes they are an Investigator but whose statement may be false\u2014and the criminal itself) can give statements that may be false.\n\nLet\u2019s check consistency:\n\u2003\u2013 Player 1 (Investigator) says Player 6 is criminal. (TRUE)\n\u2003\u2013 Player 2 (if Investigator) says \u201cPlayer 1 is not criminal.\u201d (TRUE)\n\u2003\u2013 Player 4 (if Investigator) says \u201cPlayer 6 is criminal.\u201d (TRUE)\n\u2003\u2013 Player 6, being the Criminal, is free to say anything; his statement \u201cPlayer 2 is not criminal\u201d does not affect our logical assignment.\n\nNow consider Players 3 and 5. In a valid assignment there are exactly four Investigators among the six players. I know my own role is Investigator; if we assign Player 6 as Criminal then among Players 2, 3, 4, and 5 there must be exactly three Investigators and one Rumormonger. Investigators always state the truth. In our set:\n\u2003\u2013 Player 3 says \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal.\u201d But if we are accepting Player 6 as criminal, this statement is false. So Player 3 cannot be an Investigator; he must be the Rumormonger.\n\u2003\u2013 Player 5 says \u201cPlayer 6 is not criminal.\u201d That statement is false if Player 6 is criminal. But Player 5, then, also would not be telling the truth. Yet we already have one Rumormonger among Players 2\u20135, and there can be only one.\nThus we face a puzzle: Two players (Players 3 and 5) have made statements that are false, yet among the non\u2013Investigator roles (with Player 6 being criminal) only one Rumormonger is allowed.\n\nThe conflict is this: Accepting my (Player 1\u2019s) known truthful statement forces Player 6 to be criminal. However, under that assignment the statements from Players 3 and 5 lead to two people giving false information even though at most one of them is permitted to be non\u2013Investigator.\n\nBecause I know my own role is Investigator and I must speak truthfully, I must trust my own statement. Despite the fact that the other statements (from Players 3 and 5) cannot simultaneously be reconciled with only one Rumormonger, the only conclusion I can (and must) draw from what I know is that Player 6 is the criminal.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 6.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

Since the statement is false, Player 3 cannot be an Investigator and must be the Rumormonger or (if such a role were available) a Lunatic. (But note: there are 0 Lunatics in our game.)\n\n\u2003\u2022 Player 4: \u201cPlayer 1 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 This statement is false (since I, Player 1, know I am not criminal). Thus Player 4 also cannot be an Investigator. In a valid assignment (with exactly 1 criminal and 1 rumormonger), only one non\u2010Investigator aside from Player 2 should be present. Having both Player 3 and Player 4 provide statements that are false creates a tension with the required role counts.\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2013 For an Investigator, false statements are not allowed. For the Rumormonger, mistaken or false statements are possible, but we are allowed only one Rumormonger. \n\n\u2003\u2022 Player 5: \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 This statement is true given that we have deduced Player 2 is criminal. An Investigator would say this truthfully; however, it is not enough alone to firmly decide Player 5\u2019s role.\n\n\u2003\u2022 Player 6: \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 This statement is also true under our deduction. Again, if Player 6 were an Investigator, the statement would be correct, but it does not by itself settle Player 6\u2019s role.\n\nAnalysis Summary:\n\u2003\u2013 My statement forces Player 2 to be criminal.\n\u2003\u2013 This leaves players 3, 4, 5, and 6 to fill the roles of three Investigators and one Rumormonger.\n\u2003\u2013 However, both Player 3 and Player 4 give statements that are false by the criminal assignment:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 If either were Investigator, they could not lie.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 To explain a false statement, one of them might be the Rumormonger\u2014but there is only one Rumormonger.\n\u2003\u2013 Thus, there appears to be a conflict in reconciling all players\u2019 statements with the fixed role counts.\n\u2003\nDespite this tension among the other players\u2019 statements, I must trust my own truthful testimony as an Investigator. Based solely on my statement and the rules governing an Investigator\u2019s honesty, I must commit to the conclusion that Player 2 is the criminal.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 2.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

Suppose Player 5 is the Criminal. Then:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Player 5\u2019s statement is a lie. Meanwhile, Player 3 (as an Investigator) truthfully states \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal.\u201d Plus, Player 4, by falsely accusing Player 6, would be the Rumormonger.  \n\u2003Option C.

Then:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Player 4\u2019s false accusation (\u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal\u201d) is simply an arbitrary statement allowed from a criminal.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Player 5, then acting as the Rumormonger (who mistakenly believes they are an Investigator), falsely accuses Player 3.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 The remaining players (1, 2, 3, and 6) would all be truthful Investigators.\n\n7. Option C fits very neatly with what we observe. We know for sure that Player 6 is not criminal, so an Investigator (like me) verifies that Player 4\u2019s claim is false. It then makes sense that both Players 2 and 6 confirm my innocence and Player 3 confirms Player 2\u2019s innocence. This leaves only Players 4 and 5 for the \u201cdeceptive\u201d statements. In Option C the lone Criminal is Player 4 and Player 5, while mistakenly accusing someone else, is the Rumormonger.\n\nBased solely on the Round 1 statements\u2014and given that I am an Investigator\u2014I lean toward Option C as the most consistent explanation.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 4.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

Thus my statements are true.\n\u2022 Investigators always tell the truth.\n\u2022 There are exactly 4 Investigators, 1 Criminal, and 1 Rumormonger.\n\u2022 (From Round\u202f1 we saw some inconsistencies\u2014for example, Player\u202f4\u2019s statement \u201cPlayer\u202f6 is the criminal\u201d is false, and Player\u202f5\u2019s claim \u201cPlayer\u202f3 is the criminal\u201d is false. One consistent configuration from Round\u202f1 was to have Player\u202f5 as the Criminal and Player\u202f4 as the Rumormonger. Let\u2019s check if Round\u202f2 supports that possibility.)\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\nStep 2. Analyzing Round\u202f2 statements:\n\n\u2022 Player\u202f1: \u201cPlayer\u202f2 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2013 As an Investigator, my statement is reliable. So Player\u202f2 is indeed not the criminal.\n\n\u2022 Player\u202f2: \u201cPlayer\u202f5 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2013 If Player\u202f2 is an Investigator (which is likely given what we saw in Round\u202f1) then this must be true.\n\n\u2022 Player\u202f3: \u201cPlayer\u202f5 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2013 Similarly, an Investigator would tell the truth. This supports Player\u202f5 being the criminal.\n\n\u2022 Player\u202f4: \u201cPlayer\u202f3 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2013 Whether Player\u202f4 is the Criminal or a Rumormonger, this statement can be arbitrary. Note that in our Round\u202f1 consideration Player\u202f4 already gave a false statement. So Player\u202f4 is more likely to be the Rumormonger in our consistent configuration.\n\n\u2022 Player\u202f5: \u201cPlayer\u202f6 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2013 If Player\u202f5 is the Criminal, they are free to say anything, so this statement is untrustworthy.\n\n\u2022 Player\u202f6: \u201cPlayer\u202f5 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2013 Again, if Player\u202f6 is an Investigator, then this statement confirms that Player\u202f5 is indeed the criminal.\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\nStep 3. Putting it all together:\n\n\u2022 My own statement (\u201cPlayer\u202f2 is not the criminal\u201d) is true.\n\u2022 Three players (Players\u202f2, 3, and 6) say that Player\u202f5 is the criminal. If these are Investigators telling the truth, then Player\u202f5 must be the Criminal.\n\u2022 In Round\u202f1, note that Player\u202f5 claimed \u201cPlayer\u202f3 is the criminal,\u201d which is false if we take Player\u202f3 as an Investigator. That fits the behavior expected from a Criminal.\n\u2022 Meanwhile, Player\u202f4\u2019s Round\u202f1 false accusation (\u201cPlayer\u202f6 is the criminal\u201d) and his Round\u202f2 statement (\u201cPlayer\u202f3 is not the criminal\u201d) are consistent with the role of a Rumormonger (who believes they\u2019re an Investigator but may make mistakes).\n\nThis configuration gives us:\n\u2003\u2013 Investigators: Players\u202f1, 2, 3, and 6 (all consistent with their truthful claims).\n\u2003\u2013 Criminal: Player\u202f5.\n\u2003\u2013 Rumormonger: Player\u202f4.\n\nThis neatly meets the game\u2019s requirement of 4 Investigators, 1 Criminal, and 1 Rumormonger.\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\nFinal Judgment now is:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 5.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

Looking at Others\u2019 Statements for Consistency  \nLet\u2019s review what everyone has said so far:\n\nRound 1 Statements:\n\u2003\u2022 Player 1 (myself): \u201cPlayer 3 is the criminal.\u201d \u2192 (True)  \n\u2003\u2022 Player 2: \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal.\u201d \u2192 (This contradicts my statement, so it is false in this candidate scenario.)  \n\u2003\u2022 Player 3: \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal.\u201d \u2192 (If Player 3 is Criminal, we do not require truthful consistency from them; this statement may or may not be true.)  \n\u2003\u2022 Player 4: \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d \u2192 (That is true, given I am innocent.)  \n\u2003\u2022 Player 5: \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal.\u201d \u2192 (False under our candidate.)  \n\u2003\u2022 Player 6: \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal.\u201d \u2192 (True if Player 3 is indeed the criminal.)\n\nRound 2 Statements:\n\u2003\u2022 Player 1 (myself): \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d \u2192 (True by my role.)  \n\u2003\u2022 Player 2: \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal.\u201d \u2192 (That is true if Player 3 is Criminal.)  \n\u2003\u2022 Player 3: \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d \u2192 (Arbitrary from the Criminal\u2019s perspective.)  \n\u2003\u2022 Player 4: \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d \u2192 (True.)  \n\u2003\u2022 Player 5: \u201cPlayer 1 is the criminal.\u201d \u2192 (False under our candidate.)  \n\u2003\u2022 Player 6: \u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal.\u201d \u2192 (False if Player 3 is the criminal.)\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500  \nStep 4. A Note About Overall Role Distribution  \nWe know the game has exactly 4 Investigators (who always speak truthfully), 1 Criminal, and 1 Rumormonger.  \n\u2022 Since I am an Investigator and my statements are completely true, the candidate \u201cPlayer 3 is Criminal\u201d remains solid.  \n\u2022 While some players\u2019 statements conflict with this candidate, investigators are the only ones guaranteed to be always truthful.  \n\u2022 Other roles (the Criminal and the Rumormonger) are permitted to make statements that are false or arbitrarily true or false.  \n\u2022 Even if some players make at least one statement that conflicts with the candidate solution, that is acceptable if they are not Investigators.  \n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500  \nStep 5. Final Deduction  \nMy own statements force the conclusion that Player 3 is the criminal. Although some players have given a mix of apparently correct and incorrect statements, only the Investigators are bound to speak truthfully. Since I trust my own Investigator status, the only candidate that fits is:  \n\u2003Final Criminal = Player 3  \nand  \n\u2003My Role = Investigator.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500  \nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 3.\nMy Role Is Investigator.

Considering Role Consistency  \nOnly Investigators must speak the truth on every statement. Because I know I am an Investigator, my statements must be all true. Given my fixed truths, the criminal can only be Player\u00a03. (Any assignment that rejected that would directly contradict my verified, truthful Round\u00a01 statement.)  \n\nThe remaining roles must account for a total of 4 Investigators and 1 Rumormonger among Players 2, 4, 5, and 6. In an ideal distribution, every Investigator (besides me) would have uttered only true statements. However, as we see, each of Players 2, 4, 5, and 6 has at least one statement that is false when compared with the conclusion \u201ccriminal = Player\u00a03.\u201d  \nSince only non\u2010Investigator roles (the Criminal, which here is Player\u00a03, and the Rumormonger) are allowed to make mistakes, the fact that every other player has an error is inconsistent with the stipulated role distribution.  \n\nAlthough the collective statements from Players 2, 4, 5, and 6 do not permit a fully consistent assignment of \u201calways\u2010truthful\u201d Investigator roles among them, I must give priority to my own knowledge as a guaranteed Investigator.  \n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500  \n4. Final Judgment  \nBecause I know without doubt that I am an Investigator and my Round\u00a01 statement (\u201cPlayer\u00a03 is the criminal\u201d) is truthful, I must conclude that the Criminal is Player\u00a03\u2014even if the other rounds show inconsistencies that would force us to wonder about the behavior of the others.  \n\nThus, despite the tension in the overall responses, my final judgment \u2013 based on the verifiable truth of my own statements \u2013 is as follows:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 3.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

For instance, multiple players (such as Player 2 and Player 6 in Round 1, and Player 4 in Round 2) stated or implied information that is true only if Player 1 is indeed the criminal.\n\n\u2003\u2022 In Round 3, the statements are as follows:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Player 1 (me): \u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal.\u201d (Being the Criminal, I can make arbitrary or false claims.)\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Player 2: \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d (If an Investigator, this is truth, and it is correct.)\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Player 3: \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d (Again, consistent with truth.)\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Player 4: \u201cPlayer 1 is the criminal.\u201d (This truthfully identifies me as the criminal.)\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Player 5: \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d (This directly contradicts what we know from other true testimony.

Recap from earlier rounds:\n\u2003\u2022 In Round 1, nearly every statement (from Players 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6) was consistent with Player 1 being the criminal.\n\u2003\u2022 In Round 2, most players\u2019 statements remained consistent with Player 1 as the criminal. One notable exception was Player 3; in Round 2, Player 3 claimed \u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal,\u201d which is false if Player 1 is in fact the criminal. This anomalous statement suggests that Player 3 is not a true Investigator but is likely the Rumormonger (since Rumormongers believe they are Investigators but can provide incorrect information).\n\n3. Now evaluating Round 3 statements:\n\u2003\u2022 Player 1 (me) says \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal.\u201d As the Criminal, I can say anything.\n\u2003\u2022 Player 2 says \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal.\u201d Under the scenario where I am the Criminal, this is true.\n\u2003\u2022 Player 3 says \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d This statement is true, but note that Player 3\u2019s earlier statement in Round 2 was false. Such inconsistent behavior is indicative of a Rumormonger.\n\u2003\u2022 Player 4 says \u201cPlayer 1 is the criminal.\u201d That is a truthful statement and aligns with the behavior expected from an Investigator.\n\u2003\u2022 Player 5 says \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal.\u201d Again, true.\n\u2003\u2022 Player 6 says \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal.\u201d True as well, since Player 3 is our Rumormonger, not the criminal.\n\n4. Synthesis of Analysis:\n\u2003\u2022 There is consistent evidence across rounds that the actual criminal is Player 1.\n\u2003\u2022 The majority of players (Players 2, 4, 5, and 6) have provided statements that are consistently true, which is the trait of an Investigator.\n\u2003\u2022 Player 3, whose statements have shown inconsistency (a false claim in Round 2 followed by a true claim in Round 3), fits the profile of a Rumormonger.\n\u2003\u2022 With 4 Investigators, 1 Rumormonger, and me as the Criminal, the roles are consistent with the game\u2019s design.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

Thus Player 2 cannot be one of the four Investigators. He must either be the Criminal (who can lie or tell the truth) or the Rumormonger (who mistakenly believes he\u2019s an Investigator but may be wrong).\n\n\u2022\u2003Player 3 says \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003This statement could be a truthful Investigator\u2019s claim or a mistaken claim from a Rumormonger.\n\n\u2022\u2003Player 4 says \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003Since I (Player 1) am indeed not the criminal, this statement is accurate.

Since I am a trustworthy Investigator and my statement \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal\u201d must be true, it indicates that Player 2\u2019s claim is false. This makes it more likely that Player 2 is the Criminal (or possibly the Rumormonger\u2014but note there is only one Rumormonger in addition to the one Criminal).\n\nGiven that there are four Investigators and I already occupy one position, and knowing that a true Investigator would never contradict another Investigator\u2019s correct claim, the statement by Player 2 carries suspicion. Although further rounds may provide additional details to nail down all roles, based solely on Round 1 the strongest suspicion is on Player 2 for being the Criminal.\n\nFinal Judgment after Round 1:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 2.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

Players whose statements are always true against the fact that Player 6 is criminal (like Players 3 and 4, and my own statements) are likely Investigators.\n\u2022\u2003Player 2\u2019s statements are consistently false (claiming Player 4 is criminal in Round 1 and denying that Player 6 is criminal in Round 2). Since there is exactly one criminal and I\u2019m certain that is Player 6, Player 2 cannot be an Investigator. Thus, Player 2 is likely the Rumormonger.\n\u2022\u2003Player 5 made an incorrect statement in Round 1 (\u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal\u201d) but then a correct one in Round 2. Such a mixed record fits the behavior of a Rumormonger only if they sometimes make mistakes; however, since there is only one Rumormonger and I have already identified Player 2 as fitting that role, it is most consistent to treat Player 5 as one of the Investigators who happened to err in one round (an Investigator cannot knowingly lie, so if a mistake occurs it must be because their information was incomplete\u2014but all truthful statements here are judged for consistency with the fact that Player 6 is criminal). Given that my analysis requires full consistency from Investigators, I lean toward assigning Player 5 as an Investigator whose one statement might have been based on misinterpretation by a Rumormonger\u2019s influence in the group dynamic. \n\nThus, with Player 6 as the Criminal and the only possible Rumormonger being Player 2 (because his statements are blatantly false given our known truth), the remaining players\u2014Players 1 (me), 3, 4, and 5\u2014are best interpreted as Investigators.\n\nFinal Judgment after Round 2:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 6.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

This is a truthful fact.\n\n\u2022 Player 2 says that Player 4 is not the criminal. If Player 2 is acting as an Investigator (truthfully) then Player 4 indeed is not the criminal. (Player 4 could still be either an Investigator or the Rumormonger, but not the Criminal.)\n\n\u2022 Player 3 states that Player 1 is not the criminal. Since I know I\u2019m not the criminal, this statement is true. (Again, Player 3 is either an Investigator telling the truth or a Rumormonger who happens to state the truth.)\n\n\u2022 Player 4 claims that Player 6 is the criminal. If Player 4 were an Investigator, then we must accept that Player 6 really is the criminal. (It is also possible that Player 4 is the Rumormonger\u2014but note that, while Rumormongers may be mistaken, if Player 4 is truthful it would point toward Player 6.)\n\n\u2022 Player 5 also says that Player 6 is the criminal. If Player 5 is an Investigator, his statement confirms that claim.\n\n\u2022 Finally, Player 6 says that Player 5 is the criminal. If Player 6 were an Investigator, then his statement must be true; however, this would conflict with the two accusations that Player 6 is the criminal. Therefore, it is more consistent to conclude that Player 6 is not acting as an Investigator\u2014which is allowed if Player 6 is the Criminal (who may lie) or possibly even a Rumormonger. Given that Player 2 has already declared \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal,\u201d the possibility of Player 4 being the Criminal is ruled out. \n\nAt this point there appear to be two possible assignments:\n\nOption 1:\n\u2003\u2013 Assume Player 4 and Player 5 are Investigators (or at least one is Investigator and the other could be the Rumormonger but here playing out correct statements).\n\u2003\u2013 Their mutual claim that Player 6 is the criminal is taken as truth.\n\u2003\u2013 That makes Player 6 the Criminal.\n\u2003\u2013 Then the assignments would be: Investigators: Players 1, 2, 3, and 5; Rumormonger: Player 4 (even if his statement accidentally agrees with the truth); Criminal: Player 6.\n\nOption 2:\n\u2003\u2013 Alternatively, if we assume Player 4 (accusing Player 6) is the Rumormonger (and his statement might be mistaken) and Player 6 (as an Investigator) is truthful when accusing Player 5, then Player 5 would be the Criminal.\n\u2003\u2013 That would lead to: Investigators: Players 1, 2, 3, and 6; Rumormonger: Player 4; Criminal: Player 5.\n\nBoth assignments are consistent with the statements so far because non-Investigator roles (Criminal and Rumormonger) may give statements that are either true or false.\n\nHow do we decide? Two independent accusations are made that Player 6 is the criminal\u2014one by Player 4 and one by Player 5. \n\u2022 In Option 1, if Player 5 is an Investigator, his claim \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal\u201d must be true.\n\u2022 In Option 2, Player 5 is the Criminal and his claim is false, which means that only one Investigator (Player 6) would be saying that \u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal,\u201d while a Rumormonger (Player 4) mistakenly asserts that Player 6 is criminal.\n\nGiven that Investigators are consistent truth-tellers, the scenario that yields two Investigator statements accusing the same person (Player 6) is stronger evidence. (It is acceptable if one of these turns out to be the Rumormonger giving a correct statement by chance, but the weight of two matching accusations supports Player 6 being the criminal more directly.)\n\nThus, the most natural and consistent assignment is:\n\u2003\u2013 Final Criminal: Player 6.\n\u2003\u2013 Investigator roles are assigned to Players 1, 2, 3, and 5, with Player 4 being the Rumormonger.\n\nFinal Judgment After Round 2:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 6.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

The statements from Players 4 and 6 conflict with the known fact that Player 2 is not criminal\u2014they both claim \u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal.\u201d As an Investigator, I know that investigators always tell the truth, so neither Player 4 nor Player 6 can be an Investigator.

Player\u202f3 also says, \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d That is consistent with what I know about myself and supports the idea that Player\u202f3\u2019s statement is true.\n\n3. Consider Player\u202f2\u2019s statement: \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal.\u201d If Player\u202f2 were a truthful Investigator, then Player\u202f6 would be innocent. (If instead Player\u202f2 were a Rumormonger, he might be mistaken. But we\u2019ll check consistency with the others.)\n\n4. Both Players\u202f4 and\u202f6 say that \u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal.\u201d If either were a truthful Investigator, then their claim would force Player\u202f2 to be criminal. (Because only Investigators always tell the truth.) At least one Investigator among them would not lie, but note that we cannot have both being genuine Investigators if their statements contradict Player\u202f2\u2019s potential Investigator\u2013status.\n\n5. Now look at Player\u202f5\u2019s statement: \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d If Player\u202f5 is an Investigator then that assures us that Player\u202f4 is indeed innocent.\n\n6. Let\u2019s examine the possibilities:\n\u2003\u2003a. Suppose Player\u202f2 were not the criminal. Then Players\u202f4 and\u202f6 would be falsely accusing an innocent Player\u202f2. But if either of them were supposed to be a truthful Investigator, that can\u2019t happen. We\u2019d need both to be non-investigators. However, then check Player\u202f2\u2019s own statement: \u201cPlayer\u202f6 is not the criminal.\u201d If Player\u202f2 were an Investigator then his statement would be true \u2013 meaning Player\u202f6 is innocent \u2013 leaving no candidate for the single criminal among Players\u202f4 and\u202f6. Alternatively, if Player\u202f2 were not an Investigator, then many investigators would be missing among the remaining players. This scenario leads to conflict.\n\n\u2003\u2003b. Now suppose Player\u202f2 is the criminal. Then:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 Player\u202f4\u2019s and Player\u202f6\u2019s statements (\u201cPlayer\u202f2 is the criminal\u201d) are true. If they are indeed Investigators, they must tell the truth.\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 Player\u202f2\u2019s own statement (\u201cPlayer\u202f6 is not the criminal\u201d) could be arbitrarily chosen since the criminal may choose truth or falsehood.\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 Player\u202f5\u2019s statement (\u201cPlayer\u202f4 is not the criminal\u201d) is true if Player\u202f4 is innocent.\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 My statement and Player\u202f3\u2019s statement (about Players\u202f3 and\u202f1, respectively) continue to be true.\n\u2003\u2003This assignment yields a consistent picture: Player\u202f2 is criminal, and the other five players (including myself) would be non\u2010criminal. Since the game setup requires exactly four Investigators (who always tell the truth) and one Rumormonger (who believes he is an Investigator but might err), one of these five must actually be the Rumormonger. It makes sense that even if that person\u2019s statement turned out correct in Round\u202f2, the role assignment can still be maintained.\n\n7. Based on these considerations, Round\u202f2\u2019s statements point most consistently to Player\u202f2 being the criminal.\n\nThus, my Round 2 judgment is:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 2.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

In Round\u202f1 I said \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal,\u201d in Round\u202f2 \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal,\u201d and in Round\u202f3 \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d Therefore, Players\u202f2, 3, and 5 (along with myself) are definitely not the criminal.\n\n2. That leaves only Players\u202f4 and 6 as possibilities for the criminal. (Recall there must be exactly one Criminal and one Rumormonger besides the four true Investigators.)\n\n3. In both Round\u202f1 and Round\u202f2, Players\u202f4 and 6 each claimed \u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal.\u201d Since Player\u202f2 is cleared by my truthful Round\u202f1 statement (and overwhelmingly supported in the others), both these statements are false. Thus, neither Player\u202f4 nor Player\u202f6 is an Investigator. One of them must be the Criminal and the other the Rumormonger.\n\n4. In Round\u202f3, Player\u202f4 says \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal.\u201d Consider the two possibilities:\n\u2003\u2003a. If Player\u202f4 is the Criminal, then his claim \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal\u201d is actually true (since the criminal is unique). Although the Criminal can mix truthful and false statements to confuse others, both his rounds 1\u20132 accusations are clearly false.\n\u2003\u2003b. Alternatively, if Player\u202f6 is the Criminal then Player\u202f4 would be the Rumormonger. In that case, his Round\u202f3 statement \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal\u201d is false.\n\u2003\u2003Both alternatives could occur, but note that the pattern of behavior (repeatedly accusing Player\u202f2 when we know that\u2019s false) and the deflection in Round\u202f3 from Player\u202f4 fits more naturally with the role of someone deliberately misleading\u2014in this case, leaning toward Player\u202f4 being the Criminal.\n\n5. Based on the combined evidence\u2014and noting that the four remaining players (Players\u202f1, 2, 3, and 5) have all given statements consistent with true Investigators\u2014I conclude that it is most consistent to assign the criminal role to Player\u202f4, with Player\u202f6 then being the Rumormonger.\n\nThus, my final judgment is:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 4.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

Given the game\u2019s roles (4 Investigators, 1 Criminal, 1 Rumormonger), and with Players 1, 2, 3, and 5 being the likely Investigators, one of Players 4 and 6 must be the Criminal and the other the Rumormonger.\n\n4. Review Players 4 and 6:\n\u2003\u2022 In Round 1, Player 6 claims \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal,\u201d but in Round 2 and 3 Player 6 makes conflicting false claims (e.g., \u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal\u201d in Round 2 and \u201cPlayer 1 is the criminal\u201d in Round 3). An Investigator would always tell the truth, so if Player 2\u2019s testimony is correct (as we expect from an Investigator), then Player 6 is acting in a deceptive role.\n\u2003\u2022 Meanwhile, Player 4 in Round 2 says \u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal\u201d (a false statement, since I know Player 5 is not criminal) and in Round 3 says \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal\u201d (which is false if Player 6 is indeed criminal). These inconsistencies are expected from either a criminal or a rumormonger, but Player 2\u2019s truthful testimony directly pinpoints Player 6 as criminal.\n\n5. Conclusion:\n\u2003Since Player 2 (an Investigator) firmly accuses Player 6, the consistent interpretation is that:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Player 6 is the Criminal.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Player 4, by elimination, is the Rumormonger.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 And I, along with Players 2, 3, and 5, are the Investigators.\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 6.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

(Note: In this game each round\u2019s set of statements is treated as a fresh basis for deduction, even though my earlier round\u2010judgment differed. In Round 2 I must now update my analysis based solely on the Round 2 declarations.)\n\nStep 1. I am Player 1 and am told I am an Investigator. As an Investigator I must state only the truth. In Round 2 my statement is \u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal.\u201d That means that in Round 2 the criminal must be Player 5.\n\nStep 2. Now consider the other Round 2 statements assuming Player 5 is indeed criminal:\n\u2003\u2022 Player 2 says \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal.\u201d If the criminal is actually Player 5, then this statement is false.\n\u2003\u2022 Player 3 says \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal.\u201d With Player 5 as criminal, this claim is true.\n\u2003\u2022 Player 4 says \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal.\u201d That statement is false under the assumption that Player 5 is criminal.\n\u2003\u2022 Player 5 (the criminal) says \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal.\u201d As the criminal, Player 5 can lie or tell the truth\u2014the false statement here is part of his strategy.\n\u2003\u2022 Player 6 says \u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal.\u201d This statement, coming from Player 6, is true.\n\nStep 3. Role consistency check with the prescribed roles (4 Investigators, 1 Criminal, 1 Rumormonger):\n\u2003\u2013 As an Investigator, I (Player 1) must be truthful. I stated \u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal,\u201d which under our assumption is correct.\n\u2003\u2013 Players whose statements are true must be Investigators (if they believe they are Investigators) because only Investigators always tell the truth. Hence, Player 3 and Player 6 appear to be Investigators.\n\u2003\u2013 Players 2 and 4, having made false statements about who the criminal is, cannot be Investigators. Therefore, one must be the sole Rumormonger (who thinks they\u2019re an Investigator but can be mistaken) and the other is not a candidate for a second non\u2010Investigator because we already have our criminal (Player 5). (Any slight inconsistency arising in the non\u2010truthful statements among non\u2010Investigator roles is not unexpected.)\n\u2003\u2013 Player 5 is the criminal (which explains his misleading statement).\n\nThus, based on the Round 2 statements and knowing my own Investigator role, the most consistent conclusion is that the criminal is Player 5.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 5.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

Two players make claims about Player 4: Player 2 says \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal\u201d while Player 3 says \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d Since Investigators must always be truthful, both could not be honest. That implies one of Player 2 or Player 3 must be non\u2010Investigator (that is, either the Rumormonger or if they were the criminal, they can lie arbitrarily).\n3. Looking at the overall roles (4 Investigators, 1 Criminal, 1 Rumormonger) and the other statements (Players 4, 5 and 6 all provide statements that are consistent with what we know, given that Player 1 is not criminal and my statement shows Player 6 is not criminal), there emerge two possibilities regarding who the criminal is.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Possibility A: If Player 4 were the criminal, then Player 2\u2019s statement (\u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal\u201d) would be true (suggesting Player 2 is Investigator) while Player 3 would be mistaken (and thus is likely the Rumormonger). The remaining players (Players 1, 2, 5, 6) would be Investigators.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Possibility B: Alternatively, if Player 3 were criminal, then Player 2\u2019s statement would be false \u2013 meaning Player 2 would have to be the Rumormonger (since an Investigator never lies) and Players 1, 4, 5, 6 would be Investigators.\n4. Comparing these possibilities, Possibility A (with Player 4 as the criminal) is slightly more natural to assume at this point. In that scenario the only false or misleading statement comes from Player 3 (the Rumormonger), while Player 2 (an Investigator) clearly identifies the criminal.\n\nThus, based only on Round 1 information, my best conclusion is:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 4.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

I (Player 1, an Investigator) say, \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal.\u201d Because I always tell the truth as an Investigator, this statement tells us that, by my account, Player 4 must be the criminal.\n\n2. Player 2 reinforces this by also stating \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal.\u201d If Player 2 is an Investigator (and there are 4 Investigators in total), then this further supports that Player 4 is indeed the criminal.\n\n3. Player 3 states \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d As an Investigator\u2019s statement must be truthful, if Player 3 is one, then Player 5 is indeed not the criminal.\n\n4. Similarly, Player 6 says \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d Again, if Player 6 is an Investigator, then this confirms that Player 5 is not criminal.\n\n5. Now, consider Player 5\u2019s statement: \u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal.\u201d This contradicts what we have from Players 1 and 2. Since only one player is the criminal (and both I and Player 2 state that Player 4 is criminal), Player 5\u2019s statement must be the misleading one. In our setting, besides Investigators (who always tell the truth), only the Rumormonger (or the Criminal or Lunatic) might provide incorrect information. Given that we have only one criminal and I trust my own truthful statement, Player 5\u2019s claim is inconsistent with the truth and so Player 5 is likely not an Investigator.\n\n6. With 4 Investigators in the game, it makes sense that Players 1, 2, 3, and 6 are following the truth while the remaining players take on the single Criminal and the Rumormonger roles. Player 4 being the target of two agreeing Investigator statements strongly identifies them as the criminal, and Player 5\u2019s false claim suggests that Player 5 is the Rumormonger.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 4.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

In Round 1 the statements already hinted at a conflict about Player 4\u2019s status. Player 2 said \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal\u201d while Player 3 said \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d Because only Investigators are perfectly truthful and I already know I am one, my truthful assertion in Round 2 carries decisive weight.\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\nStep 3. In Round 3 everyone makes \u201cnot criminal\u201d statements (except the ones from earlier accusing others). In particular, Player 3 again states \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d Since I am sure from my Investigative role (and supported by Player 2\u2019s round\u20102 statement) that Player 4 is criminal, this tells me that players who contradict that are not reliable Investigators. (They must be either the Rumormonger or the Criminal; and we already know Player 4 is our Criminal.) \n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\nStep 4.

As Player\u202f1, I know my every statement is true. However, notice that in Round\u202f1 I said \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal\u201d while in Round\u202f3 I said \u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal.\u201d Because the true state of affairs must be the same throughout the entire game (there is only one criminal) these two statements cannot both be correct. So we must weigh the total evidence from all rounds to decide which possibility is best supported by the set of players who are required to tell truth.\n\n2. Look to other strong \u201ctruth sources.\u201d Investigators always tell the truth. Although I do not know which of the other players are certainly Investigators (because the Rumormonger believes they are an Investigator but may err, and the Criminal may sometimes tell the truth), we can note the following:\n\n\u2003\u2013 In Round\u202f2, P4 states \u201cPlayer 1 is the criminal.\u201d But I know I am not the criminal, so P4 must be either the Criminal or the Rumormonger. (In any case, we cannot trust P4 to give reliably correct info.)\n\n\u2003\u2013 In Round\u202f3, two players\u2014P3 and P6\u2014both say \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal.\u201d If both P3 and P6 happen to be reliably truthful Investigators, that is strong evidence that Player\u202f4 is indeed the Criminal.\n\n3. Next, consider the \u201cnot criminal\u201d claims:\n\u2003\u2022 Several players in different rounds say \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal.\u201d (P1 in Round\u202f2, P3 in Round\u202f2, and P2, P3 in Round\u202f3 all say that.) That result is consistent with Player\u202f6 being innocent.\n\u2003\u2022 Other players (P2 in Round\u202f2 and P6 in Round\u202f2) say \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal\u201d and that fits with my identity.\n\u2003\u2022 P2 and P4 in Round\u202f1 both say \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d If Player\u00a05 were the Criminal (as my Round\u00a03 statement claims), those statements are false. But if P2 and P4 are truthful Investigators then player\u00a05 cannot be Criminal. (And note that we already have reasons to suspect P4 is not a trustworthy source because of the false accusation in Round\u00a02.)\n\n4. Now let\u2019s compare the two possibilities emerging from my own statements:\n\u2003Option A: The Criminal is Player\u00a04.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Round\u202f1: My statement \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal\u201d is true.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Round\u202f3: P3 and P6, who very well might be correct (if they are truthful Investigators) both state \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Additionally, in Round\u202f1 there is no conflict with the \u201cnot criminal\u201d claims about Player\u00a04.\n\u2003Option B: The Criminal is Player\u00a05.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Round\u202f3: My statement \u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal\u201d would then be true.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 However, in Round\u202f1 both P2 and P4 say \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d Unless both P2 and P4 are the sorts of roles allowed to lie, we would have less reliable evidence for this option. In particular, if either P2 or P4 is a genuine Investigator, then their \u201cnot criminal\u201d claim is necessarily true.\n\n5. Given we have three rounds and multiple independent voices, we have more converging evidence for Player\u00a04 being criminal because:\n\u2003\u2013 My Round\u202f1 statement (from an Investigator) pointed to player\u00a04.\n\u2003\u2013 In Round\u202f3, two different players (P3 and P6) state \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2013 Several \u201cnot criminal\u201d claims about Player\u00a05 (from Round\u202f1 and Round\u202f3) underscore that little support exists for Player\u00a05 being the criminal.\n\u2003\u2013 The anomaly of me saying different things in different rounds may be understood in our analysis as the overall body of evidence enforcing that the only self\u2010consistent assignment is to go with the majority and reliability of Investigator statements.\n\n6. Although my Round\u202f3 personal statement (\u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal\u201d) appears contradictory to my earlier statement, as an Investigator I trust the full cumulative evidence. When forced to choose the consistent possibility across all rounds it appears that the best interpretation is that Player\u00a04 is the criminal. (In a real game such inconsistencies might be resolved by noting that later rounds can sometimes \u201ccorrect\u201d earlier signals if players receive new information. Here the overwhelming support among what appear to be guaranteed true statements, from me in Round\u202f1 and from P3 and P6 in Round\u202f3, leads to Player\u00a04 as Criminal.)\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 4.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

Player 2 said \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal.\u201d If Player 2 is an Investigator (and we expect three of the remaining five players to be Investigators, since there are four in total), then his statement is true \u2013 meaning Player 6 is innocent.\n\n3. Player 3 said \u201cPlayer 1 is the criminal.\u201d Since I know I am an Investigator (and thus not the criminal), this statement is false. An Investigator would never lie, so Player 3 is either the Criminal or the Rumormonger (recall: a Rumormonger believes they are an Investigator but may be incorrect).\n\n4. Player 4 said \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal.\u201d We already established from my statement that Player 4 is not the Criminal, so he could be an Investigator. If he is indeed an Investigator then his statement is truthful, indicating that Player 3 is not the criminal. (This would force Player 3 to be the Rumormonger.)\n\n5.

But that would conflict with our tentative assignment because from (2) we are tending to believe Player 2 is honest and innocent. So it is likely that Player 5 is not an Investigator. In fact, if we assign the role of Criminal to Player 5 (and remember that only one player is the Criminal) then his statement \u2013 claiming someone else is the criminal \u2013 could be a deliberate deception.\n\n6. Player 6 said \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal.\u201d This statement agrees with Player 4\u2019s statement.

His false accusation that Player 1 is the criminal is acceptable from a Rumormonger.\n\nChecking all players\u2019 statements:\n\u2003\u2013 P1 (Investigator): \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal\u201d \u2192 True.\n\u2003\u2013 P2 (Investigator): \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal\u201d \u2192 True.\n\u2003\u2013 P3 (Rumormonger): \u201cPlayer 1 is the criminal\u201d \u2192 False (allowed error).\n\u2003\u2013 P4 (Investigator): \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal\u201d \u2192 True.\n\u2003\u2013 P5 (Criminal): \u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal\u201d \u2192 False (deception is permitted).\n\u2003\u2013 P6 (Investigator): \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal\u201d \u2192 True.\n\nEverything fits perfectly.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 5.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

This means Players 1, 2, 4, and 6 would be our four guaranteed Investigators (always truthful).\n7. The remaining two roles would then be Player 5 as the Criminal (who may lie or tell the truth) and Player 3 as the Rumormonger (who believes they are an Investigator but can be mistaken). Their statements \u2013 \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal\u201d (Player 3) and \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal\u201d (Player 5) \u2013 are not required to be truthful.\n8.

Meanwhile, Player 3 and Player 5 make statements that, if they are not Investigators, are not required to be truthful. Notice that Player 3 claims \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal\u201d which contradicts Player 4\u2019s statement. This conflict is resolved if we assign Player 3 as the Rumormonger (who may provide false or mistaken information) and Player 5 as the Criminal.\n\n5.

          "response": "I will walk through my reasoning using all the Round\u202f1 and Round\u202f2 statements together. (All players are expected to use the same role every round.) I know for a fact that I (Player\u202f1) am an Investigator, so every statement I make is true. In Round\u202f1 I said, \u201cPlayer\u202f3 is the criminal.\u201d (As an Investigator, I must speak the truth.) Thus, the reality must be that Player\u202f3 is the criminal.\n\nLet me check consistency with Round\u202f2. In Round\u202f2 my statement was \u201cPlayer\u202f5 is not the criminal\u201d (which is indeed true). Also in Round\u202f2:\n\u2003\u2022 Player\u202f2 said \u201cPlayer\u202f1 is not the criminal\u201d (this fits the fact that I am not criminal).\n\u2003\u2022 Player\u202f3 (the criminal, who may say anything) said \u201cPlayer\u202f6 is not the criminal.\u201d (Since criminals are free to be arbitrary, this does not force a truth value.)\n\u2003\u2022 Player\u202f4 stated \u201cPlayer\u202f3 is not the criminal.\u201d But because my Round\u202f1 statement is from an Investigator and must be correct, Player\u202f4\u2019s Round\u202f2 claim is false. (Only an Investigator always tells the truth; if you are not an Investigator you might speak incorrectly.)\n\u2003\u2022 Player\u202f5 said \u201cPlayer\u202f1 is not the criminal\u201d (a correct statement, though not sufficient on its own to reveal their role).\n\u2003\u2022 Player\u202f6 said \u201cPlayer\u202f2 is not the criminal\u201d (again, a statement that is true in any assignment).\n\nThus, aside from my own statements (which I know to be true) and those of Players\u202f2, 5, and 6 (which are consistent with what we know), the only problematic claim is from Player\u202f4 in Round\u202f2, who says that \u201cPlayer\u202f3 is not the criminal.\u201d Given that I am Investigator and must tell the truth, Player\u202f4\u2019s incorrect statement implies that Player\u202f4 is not an Investigator. Since there is only one criminal (Player\u202f3, per my Round\u202f1 statement) and no lunatics, Player\u202f4 must be the rumormonger. (Rumormongers believe they are Investigators and sometimes give false information.)\n\nThere is one remaining twist: in Round\u202f1 Player\u202f5 said \u201cPlayer\u202f3 is not the criminal\u201d \u2013 a claim that contradicts my proven Round\u202f1 statement. Because an Investigator could never make a false statement, Player\u202f5\u2019s error in Round\u202f1 tells me that in that round Player\u202f5 did not act as an Investigator. However, in Round\u202f2 Player\u202f5\u2019s statement (\u201cPlayer\u202f1 is not the criminal\u201d) was correct. (Rumormongers, though they may sometimes state the truth, are allowed to be mistaken.) In trying to assign the roles among the other non\u2010self players, I see that apart from the confirmed criminal at Player\u202f3, only one other non\u2010Investigator is allowed (the rumormonger). Although ideally every non\u2013Investigator\u2019s statements might be off, it sometimes happens with a rumormonger that one round they err and another round they say something true. (In our analysis, the strongest and unchallengeable evidence is my own Investigator statement.) \n\nGiven that my Investigator status forces my earlier Round\u202f1 claim to be correct, I must conclude that Player\u202f3 is the criminal. The extra false claim about Player\u202f3 (made in Round\u202f2 by Player\u202f4) supports the idea that Player\u202f4 is the rumormonger. (It also forces me to consider that the apparent error from Player\u202f5 in Round\u202f1 must be due to their mistaken rumormonger belief even if their Round\u202f2 statement happened to agree with the facts. In any case only one of the two false\u2013makers can truly be non\u2013Investigator while preserving the roles\u2014but my own known truth fixes the criminal identity.)\n\nThus, despite the inevitable tension in trying to assign every player a perfect \u201crole tag\u201d over multiple rounds (because the rumormonger is allowed to be inconsistent), the only conclusion I can stand by from my personal knowledge is:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 3.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

(Round 1 Analysis)  \n\u2022 As Player\u202f1 I stated \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal.\u201d Since I know I am an Investigator and Investigators always tell the truth, that statement means that in Round\u202f1 the criminal must have been Player\u202f6.  \n\u2022 Reviewing others in Round\u202f1, I note that:\n\u2003\u2013 Player\u202f2 said \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal\u201d (which is compatible with my role).  \n\u2003\u2013 Player\u202f3 said \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal\u201d \u2013 this contradicts my truthful statement and so suggests that Player\u202f3 is not behaving as a strict Investigator.  \n\u2003\u2013 Players\u202f4, 5, and 6 made statements that (taken with the fact that there is only one criminal) are not enough on their own to reassign roles but do hint that one among them is not always telling the truth.\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nStep 2. (Round 2 Analysis)  \nNow in Round\u202f2 the statements are:  \n\u2003\u2022 P1: \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal.\u201d (I must speak truthfully.)  \n\u2003\u2022 P2: \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2022 P3: \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2022 P4: \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2022 P5: \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2022 P6: \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal.\u201d  \n\nAgain, as an Investigator my statement in Round\u202f1 (\u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal\u201d) is fixed and must be true. (Recall also that each Investigator is consistently truthful across rounds.)  \n  \nIf we assume Player\u202f6 is indeed the criminal then among Players 2, 3, 4, and 5 there must be exactly four investigators\u2019 truths except that exactly one is in fact a Rumormonger (who believes they are an Investigator yet may be mistaken).  \n  \nExamining the rounds:\n\u2003\u2013 Player\u202f2\u2019s statements (\u201cP1 is not\u201d in Round\u202f1 and \u201cP5 is not\u201d in Round\u202f2) come out true under criminal = P6.  \n\u2003\u2013 Player\u202f4\u2019s statements (\u201cP5 is not\u201d in Round\u202f1 and \u201cP3 is not\u201d in Round\u202f2) are true under criminal = P6.  \nSo P2 and P4 are very consistent with the Investigator role.  \n\u2003\u2013 Player\u202f3, however, in Round\u202f1 said \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal\u201d (which is false under the assumed assignment) though in Round\u202f2 he said \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal\u201d (true under this assignment). This mix is exactly what one might expect from a Rumormonger (someone who believes they are an Investigator yet can be mistaken on some rounds).  \n\u2003\u2013 That leaves Player\u202f5. His statements in both rounds (\u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal\u201d) are false if our criminal is truly P6. But we have no allowance for more than one non\u2010Investigator among Players 2\u20135 (since there is exactly one Rumormonger and P3 already appears to fill that role).\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nStep 3. (Reconciling the Inconsistency)  \nI face a dilemma:  \n\u2003\u2013 My own round and the rules force me (as an Investigator) to speak truth. My Round\u202f1 statement \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal\u201d must hold.  \n\u2003\u2013 Yet if Player\u202f6 is criminal, two players among the others (P3 and P5) end up giving at least one false statement. But the game rules allow exactly one Rumormonger (apart from the criminal) who may utter incorrect statements.  \n  \nGiven that I know my own identity for sure and must be truthful, I must trust my Round\u202f1 assertion. In weighing the available evidence, the only assignment that satisfies my guaranteed true statements is to have Player\u202f6 as criminal and then (if one were to try to assign roles to the others) to place Player\u202f3 as the Rumormonger. Unfortunately, Player\u202f5\u2019s repeated false accusation (\u201cPlayer 4 is criminal\u201d) then remains unexplained by the roles allowed.  \n  \nDespite this unresolved glitch, based on what I personally know (my Investigator status and my own truthful declarations), I must commit to the conclusion that remains fixed by my information.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nFinal Conclusion  \nBecause I know for certain that an Investigator\u2019s statements are correct, my Round\u202f1 claim \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal\u201d holds. Accordingly, I conclude that despite the tension raised by other rounds\u2019 statements, the best judgment with the cumulative information is:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 6.\nMy Role Is Investigator.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nNote:  \nI acknowledge that combining the rounds yields a puzzling inconsistency regarding the truthfulness of two other players. Nonetheless, my own truth-bound statements compel me to maintain the conclusion above as the best available deduction."

(My earlier hypothesis may be discarded in light of new corroborative testimony.) \n\nExamining the later rounds:\n\u2003\u2013 In Round 2 two independent players (P5 and P6) both accused Player 4.\n\u2003\u2013 In Round 3 my (updated) statement directly asserts that Player 4 is criminal. Also, P5\u2019s Round 1 accusation and Round 2 corroborations point to Player 4.\n\u2003\u2013 Meanwhile, in Round 3 two separate players (P3 and P4) state that Player 6 is not criminal.\n\u2003\u2013 Moreover, most statements concerning others (as reported in Rounds 2 and 3 by players whose overall behavior is consistent with Investigator testimony) now indicate that Player 2, Player 5, and Player 6 are not criminal.\n\nIt appears that as the game unfolded, additional information shifted the weight of evidence from my early hypothesis (based solely on Round 1) toward a revised conclusion that Player 4 is the true criminal. In light of all the rounds, I now must update my judgment to conform with all known testimony from those players who appear to be consistently truthful.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n[Final Deduction]\n\nAlthough my Round 1 hypothesis pointed to Player 6, the cumulative evidence (including corroboration in Rounds 2 and 3 by multiple players) indicates that the only self\u2010consistent assignment\u2014which would validate all statements coming from players who must be true (including my latest statement)\u2014is that Player 4 is in fact the criminal.\n\nThus, taking into account that my current understanding must be based on the most complete information and must override an earlier hypothesis that no longer fits the overall testimony, I now conclude:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 4.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

My Own Words  \n\u2022 In Round 1 I said, \u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003As an Investigator I always tell the truth. This fixes the fact that the criminal must be Player 5. (No other assignment is possible because I know my own role.)\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\nStep 2. Checking Rounds 1 and 2 for Consistency  \n\u2022 In Round 1 several players made statements supportive of (or at least not contradicting) \u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal\u201d when compared with my statement.  \n\u2022 In Round 2 nobody accused anyone else of being criminal in a way that contradicts Player 5\u2019s guilt. (For example, several players affirmed that I\u2014Player 1\u2014am not criminal; and Player 5\u2019s statement \u201cPlayer 6 is not criminal\u201d is not in conflict with Player 5 being criminal because a criminal\u2019s statements can be arbitrary.)  \n\nAt this point the working picture is:  \n\u2003Player 1: Investigator (me)  \n\u2003Player 5: Criminal  \nAmong the remaining players (2,\u202f3,\u202f4,\u202f6) the game requires exactly four investigative roles in total\u2014that is, three Investigators and one Rumormonger (since there are no Lunatics); so exactly one of Players 2,\u202f3,\u202f4, or\u202f6 must be a Rumormonger, while the others are truth\u00adtelling Investigators.\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\nStep 3. Evaluating Round 3 Statements  \nLet\u2019s list the statements of Round 3 under the assumption that Criminal = Player 5:\n\n\u2022 Player 1 (me): \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2013 True (and as an Investigator, I must be correct).\n\n\u2022 Player 2: \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2013 This is false if indeed Player 5 is criminal.  \n\u2003\u2003Since Investigators always tell the truth, Player 2 cannot be an Investigator. Thus Player 2 must be the Rumormonger.\n\n\u2022 Player 3: \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2013 With Player 5 as criminal this is true.  \n\u2003\u2003So Player 3 is consistent with being an Investigator.\n\n\u2022 Player 4: \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2013 True under our assumption; so Player 4 can be an Investigator.\n\n\u2022 Player 5 (the criminal): \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2013 This statement is unbound because criminals may tell the truth or lie. It is not used to force a change.\n\n\u2022 Player 6: \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2013 This is false if Player 5 is criminal.  \n\u2003\u2003Since an Investigator must be truthful, Player 6 cannot be an Investigator.  \n\u2003\u2003Now note: among the players 2, 3, 4, and 6, exactly one must be Rumormonger and the rest (three) must be Investigators.  \n\u2003\u2003We already assigned Player 2 as Rumormonger.  \n\u2003\u2003Thus Player 6 is expected to be an Investigator\u2014but here Player 6 makes a false statement.  \n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\nStep 4. Resolving the Apparent Inconsistency  \nI must trust my own word as an Investigator. In Round 1 my statement \u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal\u201d is 100% correct. Therefore the only consistent final answer about who is criminal is that Player 5 is criminal. \n\nNow, regarding the non\u00adinvestigative roles, we see that:  \n\u2003\u2022 Player 2 clearly told a false statement in Round 3 and so is the Rumormonger (remember, Rumormongers believe they are Investigators and may be wrong).  \n\u2003\u2022 Player 6\u2019s statement in Round 3 (\u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal\u201d) is false. Any Investigator would have to be truthful.  \n\u2003\u2003This inconsistency tells us that Player 6\u2019s behavior is aberrant.  \nIn an ideal assignment there must be exactly one Rumormonger among Players 2,\u202f3,\u202f4, and\u202f6. With Player 2 already assigned as Rumormonger, the false statement by Player 6 is problematic. It indicates that although I must remain certain about my own role and my Round 1 statement, some players\u2019 word\u2010choices are misleading or inconsistent. (They may be mixing up or simply providing false leads due to their role\u2019s freedom; remember, only Investigators always tell the truth.)  \n\nThus, despite the puzzling behavior of Player 6, my own information and the inviolable truth of my words force the final judgment:  \n\u2003\u2022 The criminal is Player 5.  \n\u2003\u2022 I remain an Investigator.\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 5.\nMy Role Is Investigator.\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\nNote:  \nSome statements (particularly from Player 6) are inconsistent with what we expect from an Investigator; they must come from a non\u2011Investigator role. Although this leaves a puzzle regarding the exact assignment of the Rumormonger (which by game rules is unique), nothing changes the certainty of my own role or my initial proven truth that Player 5 is the criminal."

In Round 2 a number of other players back up the claim that Player\u202f5 is criminal (Players\u202f2 and\u202f6), while Players\u202f3 and\u202f4 make statements excluding certain players (Player\u202f3 says \u201cPlayer\u202f4 is not the criminal\u201d and Player\u202f4 says \u201cPlayer\u202f3 is not the criminal\u201d).

(Thus Player 2 is acting as an Investigator.)  \n\u2013 My statement remains true.  \n\u2013 Player 3, if criminal, is free to give any statement (here saying \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal\u201d is acceptable).  \n\u2013 The other players\u2019 statements about Players 4 and 5 are consistent with both being non\u2010criminal.  \n\u2013 To meet the role counts, four must be genuine Investigators; in this picture we could have Players 1, 2, 4, and 6 as Investigators while the remaining one (Player 5) is the Rumormonger (who, by chance, gives a correct statement here).\n\nScenario B: Suppose instead that Player 2 is the criminal.  \n\u2013 Then Player 2\u2019s statement \u201cPlayer 3 is the criminal\u201d is false (which is allowed for the criminal).  \n\u2013 My statement remains true.  \n\u2013 Players 3, 4, 5, and 6 would all have to be non\u2010criminals; however, among them only 4 can be true Investigators. One of these four must be the Rumormonger.  \n\u2013 In this case all the other statements (exonerating Players 1, 4, 5, and 6) come out \u201ctrue\u201d but there is no clear contradiction\u2014the falsehood comes solely from Player 2\u2019s statement.\n\nStep 4: Weighing the Possibilities  \nBoth scenarios can be arranged to satisfy the mechanics. However, notice that in Scenario A, Player 2 (whom we have no reason to doubt if he is an Investigator) gives a decisive and consistent statement implicating Player 3, while in Scenario B the only \u201csignal\u201d would be Player 2\u2019s false claim. Since Investigators always tell the truth and Rumormongers may inadvertently or even intentionally mislead, the direct and simple nature of Player 2\u2019s claim in Scenario A (assuming he is an Investigator) makes that possibility more natural.

It also explains why Player 2\u2019s accusation in Round 3 (targeting Player 3) must be disregarded as a deception typical of either a Criminal or a Rumormonger\u2014and here Player 2 becomes the Rumormonger.\n\nIt must be acknowledged that my own earlier Round 1 statement conflicts with this final view. In a dynamic game my public stance might update over time as I gather more evidence. Based on all rounds combined, however, I must now commit to the latest evidence that leads to a coherent assignment of roles.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 4.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

Three players (Players 1, 3, and 4) make the same \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal\u201d claim \u2013 which lends credence to the idea that Player 6 is indeed innocent.\n2. Player 6 says \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal,\u201d which supports Player 4\u2019s innocence.\n3. Player 2 says \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d Since I am an Investigator, that statement is factually correct whether or not Player 2 is an Investigator or someone else.\n4. Only Player 5 offers an accusation \u2013 \u201cPlayer 3 is the criminal.\u201d If Player 5 were an Investigator they would never be wrong. However, because there is exactly one Criminal and one Rumormonger (the latter of whom may give an incorrect statement even though they believe they are Investigators), we must question this sole accusation.\n5. Given that four players (including myself) have statements that consistently exonerate Players 6 and 4 and the nonaccusatory tone of Player 2\u2019s remark, it is most natural to suspect that the bulk of the reliable testimonies come from the four Investigators. This then leaves Players 3 and 5 as the only remaining suspects for the special roles.\n6. In one possible split the four Investigators would be Players 1, 2, 4, and 6. Then the two remaining\u2014Player 3 and Player 5\u2014must fill the Criminal and Rumormonger roles.

Looking at Player 2\u2019s statements: in Round 1 Player 2 stated that \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal\u201d (which is true) and in Round 2 said \u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal.\u201d Since Player 2\u2019s first statement agrees with the known truth and there\u2019s a growing consensus that Player 3 is innocent, it is reasonable to trust Player 2 as an Investigator telling us that Player 5 is the criminal.\n5. Regarding Player 3, note that their statements conflict: Round 1 they declared \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal\u201d (which fits the consensus), but in Round 2 they assert \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal.\u201d This inconsistency means Player 3 likely is not an Investigator. Since we expect four true Investigators and we have strong support that Players 1, 2, 4, and 6 are in that group, Player 3 is more likely to be the Rumormonger.\n6. With the four Investigators presumably being Players 1, 2, 4, and 6, the remaining two roles \u2013 Criminal and Rumormonger \u2013 must be assigned to Players 3 and 5. Given that Player 2 (an Investigator) explicitly accuses Player 5 and that Player 5 consistently misdirects with a false charge against Player 3, it is most consistent to conclude that Player 5 is the Criminal.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 5.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

In Round 1 I stated \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal\u201d (true) and in Rounds 2 and 3 I stated \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal\u201d (true). Thus, Players 6 and 3 are innocent.\n\n2. Looking at Player 2, in Round 1 they said \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal\u201d (true); in Round 2 they declared \u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal\u201d (so\u2014if Player 2 is an Investigator, that accusation must be correct); and in Round 3 they again said \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d These consistent truthful claims from Player 2 strongly indicate that Player 2 is an Investigator and that if his claim in Round 2 is truthful then Player 5 is the criminal.\n\n3. Consider Player 4: In Round 1, Player 4 said \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal\u201d (true). In Round 2 they stated \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal\u201d (true), and in Round 3 they said \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal\u201d (true). This consistency makes it likely that Player 4 is an Investigator.\n\n4. Next, examine Player 6: In Round 1, \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal\u201d (aligns with our emerging pattern). In Round 2, Player 6 said \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal\u201d (true), and in Round 3 they quoted \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal\u201d (true). This consistently truthful behavior fits an Investigator\u2019s profile.\n\n5. Now look at Player 3. They said in Round 1 \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal\u201d (true), but in Round 2 they claim \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal\u201d (a false statement given the other evidence). In Round 3 they assert \u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal.\u201d Since an Investigator would never contradict the truth, Player 3 is not one. Their pattern of sometimes true and sometimes incorrect fits a Rumormonger (who believes they are an Investigator) rather than the consistent Investigator. \n\n6. Finally, inspect Player 5. In Round 1, Player 5 accused \u201cPlayer 3 is the criminal\u201d (false, since we know Player 3 is innocent based on my statement and those of Players 4 and 6). In Round 2, Player 5 repeated \u201cPlayer 3 is the criminal\u201d (again false). In Round 3, Player 5 said \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal.\u201d Although that statement is factually correct, if Player 5 were an Investigator they wouldn\u2019t have falsely accused Player 3 in earlier rounds. This pattern\u2014making misleading (false) accusations\u2014is what we expect from the Criminal, whose goal is to confuse.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\u2022 The four Investigators appear to be Players 1, 2, 4, and 6.\n\u2022 That leaves Players 3 and 5 for the special roles.\n\u2022 Given that Player 2 (a trusted Investigator) explicitly accuses Player 5 and Player 5\u2019s own statements have been misleading, the evidence strongly points to Player 5 being the Criminal. Player 3, with inconsistent statements, fits the role of the Rumormonger.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 5.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

My own statement (\u201cPlayer\u00a06 is not the criminal\u201d) is truthful. Thus, Player\u00a06 cannot be the criminal.\n\n2. Players\u00a02 and\u00a03 both say \u201cPlayer\u00a04 is not the criminal.\u201d If either of them is an Investigator, then their statement is true. Player\u00a04 also says \u201cPlayer\u00a03 is not the criminal,\u201d which, if he is an Investigator, confirms that Player\u00a03 is safe. In any case, these statements strongly exonerate both Player\u00a03 and Player\u00a04 when coming from truth\u2010tellers.\n\n3. Player\u00a06 claims \u201cPlayer\u00a01 is the criminal.\u201d Since I\u2019m an Investigator and thus my identity is known to me, this accusation is obviously false. (Investigators always tell the truth, so Player\u00a06 must not be an Investigator. Since I\u2019ve already ruled him out as the criminal from my statement, he is likely the Rumormonger.)\n\n4. The only remaining conflicting statements are between Player\u00a05 and Player\u00a02. Player\u00a05 accuses \u201cPlayer\u00a02 is the criminal.\u201d One possibility is that Player\u00a05 is an Investigator telling the truth \u2013 which would make Player\u00a02 the criminal. However, note that if Player\u00a05 were an Investigator then, along with myself and Players\u00a03 and\u00a04 there would be four Investigators. That would leave Player\u00a02 as the sole Criminal and Player\u00a06 as the Rumormonger. \n\n5. Alternatively, if Player\u00a05 is instead the Criminal (who may lie or tell the truth at will), then his accusation against Player\u00a02 would be a deliberate misdirection. In this case, Player\u00a02 would be the Investigator (supporting his statement that \u201cPlayer\u00a04 is not the criminal\u201d) and the roles would be:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Investigators: Players 1, 2, 3, and 4,\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Criminal: Player\u00a05,\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Rumormonger: Player\u00a06.\n\n6. Considering that a Criminal is incentivized to shift suspicion and that Player\u00a05 is the one actively accusing another while all other statements (from Players\u00a02,\u00a03, and\u00a04) are not accusatory but merely claim non-criminal status for someone else, I lean toward the possibility that Player\u00a05 is the Criminal.\n\nBased on these points, my current best judgment after Round\u00a01 is:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 5.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

Reviewing the others: Player 6 made false claims in both rounds (accusing me in Round 1 and then calling Player 3 the criminal in Round 2). Given that only the Investigator\u2019s statements are reliable, such incorrect accusations indicate that Player 6 is not an Investigator.

Therefore, with four Investigators (Players 1, 2, 3, and 4), one Criminal (Player 5), and one Rumormonger (Player 6), all the statements from both rounds match the expected behavior.\n\nBased on this reasoning, my conclusion is:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 5.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

By rule, Investigators always tell the truth regarding whether someone is the Criminal. Hence our statement \u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal\u201d must be a truthful claim.\n\n\u2022 If Player 5 really is the Criminal, then any claim to the contrary made by an Investigator would be false. But we note:\n\u2003\u2013 Player 2 says \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d Since an Investigator would never lie, this tells us that Player 2 cannot be an Investigator. (Players who are not Investigators\u2014the Criminal and the Rumormonger\u2014may give misleading answers.)\n\u2003\u2013 Similarly, Player 6 says \u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal.\u201d With our assignment that Player 5 is the Criminal, that statement must be false; so Player 6 also cannot be an Investigator.\n\n\u2022 Meanwhile, Player 3 and Player 4 make statements that are consistent with Player 5 being the Criminal (Player 3: \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal\u201d and Player 4: \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal\u201d). Their statements could be truthful, so it is natural to place them among the remaining Investigators.\n\n\u2022 At this point the tentative assignment is:\n\u2003\u2013 Investigators (truthful): Player 1 (ourselves), Player 3, and Player 4.\n\u2003\u2013 Criminal: Player 5 (per our truthful statement).\n\u2003\u2013 That leaves Players 2 and 6 as the only ones not yet identified as Investigators. Since there is exactly one Rumormonger (and no Lunatics), exactly one of these two must be the Rumormonger and the other would have to be\u2026 well, one might have expected one of them to be the Criminal if a false statement were given by an Investigator. But because we already have Player 5 as Criminal and there is exactly one Rumormonger, both Player 2 and Player 6 giving false claims creates a puzzle.\n\n\u2022 In Round 1 we do see a conflict: assuming our role is Investigator (and we must trust our statement) forces us to conclude that Player 5 is the Criminal. But then both Player 2 and Player 6 issue false statements, yet the game\u2019s role distribution allows only one non\u2010Investigator besides the Criminal (the one Rumormonger). \n\n\u2022 Given the round\u2019s limited information and our known role as Investigator, the only conclusion we can firmly rely on is our own truthful statement. Despite the emerging tension with other players\u2019 statements, at the end of Round 1 the best available deduction is to trust our evidence and careful reasoning.\n\nFinal Judgment after Round 1:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 5.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

What does that imply for the other players?  \nThe game\u2019s roles require a total of 6 players broken into:\n\u2003\u2013 4 Investigators (always truthful)  \n\u2003\u2013 1 Criminal (can say true or false)  \n\u2003\u2013 1 Rumormonger (thinks they are an Investigator but may be wrong)\n\nIf the criminal is Player\u00a05 then we must place the four investigators among Players 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6.

Let\u2019s check the others:\n\n\u2022 Player\u00a02: \n\u2003\u2013 Round\u00a01 said \u201cPlayer\u00a05 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 If Player\u00a05 really is criminal, this statement is false.  \n\u2003\u2013 Round\u00a02 said \u201cPlayer\u00a01 is the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 That also is false (since I know I\u2019m not criminal).  \n\u2003\u2192 A person who is an Investigator could never make a false statement.  \n\u2003\u2003So Player\u00a02 cannot be an Investigator.\n\n\u2022 Player\u00a03:\n\u2003\u2013 Round\u00a01 said \u201cPlayer\u00a04 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 That is true if the criminal is Player\u00a05.  \n\u2003\u2013 Round\u00a02 said \u201cPlayer\u00a05 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 That is false if Player\u00a05 is criminal.  \n\u2003\u2192 One true and one false reply is not allowed for an Investigator, so Player\u00a03 also must be non\u2010Investigator.\n\n\u2022 Player\u00a04:\n\u2003\u2013 Round\u00a01 said \u201cPlayer\u00a06 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 That is true under the assumption that Player\u00a05 is criminal.  \n\u2003\u2013 Round\u00a02 said \u201cPlayer\u00a03 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 That is also true.  \n\u2003\u2192 Player\u00a04\u2019s statements are both true so Player\u00a04 is consistent with being an Investigator.\n\n\u2022 Player\u00a06:\n\u2003\u2013 Round\u00a01 said \u201cPlayer\u00a02 is the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Under our assumption, that is false.  \n\u2003\u2013 Round\u00a02 said \u201cPlayer\u00a05 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 That is false if Player\u00a05 is criminal.  \n\u2003\u2192 So Player\u00a06 cannot be an Investigator.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nStep 3. The tally so far (assuming my own infallible testimony) becomes:\n\u2003\u2013 Investigators (truth-tellers): Player\u00a01 (me) and Player\u00a04 for sure.  \n\u2003\u2013 Non\u2010investigators: Player\u00a02, Player\u00a03, and Player\u00a06; and by my statement, Player\u00a05 is the Criminal.\n\nBut the prescribed role count is:\n\u2003\u2022 4 Investigators  \n\u2003\u2022 1 Criminal  \n\u2003\u2022 1 Rumormonger\n\nUnder the assumption \u201cPlayer\u00a05 is criminal\u201d we have:\n\u2003\u2013 Criminal: Player\u00a05 (by my testimony).  \n\u2003\u2013 That would force the 4 Investigators to be among Players 1, 2, 3, 4, 6.  \nHowever, as shown above Players 2, 3, and 6 each made at least one false statement and therefore cannot be Investigators. This is a puzzle. In fact, if we trust my two truthful statements then exactly only Player\u00a04 (besides me) appears to speak completely truthfully. That would yield only 2 Investigators (Players\u00a01 and\u00a04) while we must have 4.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nStep 4. How to proceed?  \n\nI must follow the rule: my own statements are the sure foundation because I know my role for certain. Thus I must believe that:\n\u2003\u2022 \u201cPlayer\u00a05 is the criminal.\u201d (from Round\u00a01, which I know to be true) and  \n\u2003\u2022 \u201cPlayer\u00a04 is not the criminal.\u201d (from Round\u00a02)\n\nGiven that I have no doubt about my statements, the only possibility\u2014even though the others\u2019 statements (which seem to force more than one non\u2010investigator) lead to a counting difficulty\u2014is that external statements are coming from players whose roles are not guaranteed to be truthful (namely, either the Criminal or the Rumormonger). \n\nMy deduction then is: \n\u2003\u2013 The only candidate who my role forces me to name as criminal is Player\u00a05.\n\u2003\u2013 My role remains Investigator.\n\nYes, the other rounds\u2019 statements raise puzzles about how many people seem to be speaking falsely. (After all, we expect 4 Investigators to always tell the truth, and yet only 2 players appear to be entirely truthful across these rounds.) It is possible that some of the other players (though they sincerely think they are Investigators, if they are Rumormonger) are giving mixed answers. Nonetheless, because I know my own investigative role for sure, I must trust my own words.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nFinal Judgment after Round 2:\n\nFinal Criminal Is Player 5.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

That means:\n\u2003\u2022 In Round 1 I declared, truthfully, that \u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 In Round 2 I truthfully said \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 In Round 3 I stated \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\nNow, because the game assigns one criminal for the whole process, my Round 1 and Round 3 statements are in direct conflict. They cannot both be true if the criminal is a single, unchanging person. Since I know my role is Investigator and I have no doubt about the truthfulness required of me, this contradiction is very puzzling. In a flawless scenario my own statements would be consistent from round to round. \n\nFacing this contradiction, I must note the following:\n\u2003\u2013 My role is given as Investigator, so I must trust that requirement.\n\u2003\u2013 With the requirement that all Investigator statements are true, the present conflict means that the overall set of round statements (including my own across rounds) is inconsistent. \n\nIn a social deduction process, when confronted with conflicting evidence I have two options:\n\u20031. Reject one or more rounds as misrecorded or miscommunicated.\n\u20032. Conclude that the entire body of statements is contradictory.\n\nEven though the rest of the players\u2019 statements (including those from Players 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6) offer a tangled web of accusations and denials, my own Investigator status gives me a \u201cfixed point\u201d of trustworthiness. In Round 1 I unequivocally said, \u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal.\u201d No later statement should have conflicted with that fact if all were recorded correctly. \n\nThus, given the inconsistency, I must decide which of my own statements to trust. As an Investigator, I have no reason to doubt my role, so the logical resolution is to conclude that an error occurred with my Round 3 statement. In a social deduction game one might suspect that a late misunderstanding or a misremembering led to the conflict. \n\nSince I have to provide a final judgment\u2014and my role is known\u2014I must commit to the conclusion that is consistent with my earliest, unambiguous Investigator testimony.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nFinal Judgment\n\nBased on the analysis\u2014and giving overriding weight to the fact that my statements as an Investigator must be true\u2014I conclude:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 5.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

My statement \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal\u201d must be true, so Player 5 is indeed not the criminal.\n\n2. Look at the conflicting claims about Player 6:\n\u2003\u2022 Player 2 says \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 Player 3 says \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal.\u201d\nSince Investigators always tell the truth, if one of these speakers is an Investigator then their statement is reliable. Because the two statements conflict, at most one of them can be an Investigator. (Remember there are exactly 4 Investigators, 1 Criminal, and 1 Rumormonger.)\n\n3. Other players\u2019 statements support one another:\n\u2003\u2022 Player 4 says \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal\u201d (consistent with what I know).\n\u2003\u2022 Player 5 says \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 Player 6 says \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d\nAll these statements are consistent with what we know if the speakers are Investigators (or \u2013 in the case of non\u2010Investigators \u2013 they might coincidentally speak a true fact).\n\n4.

And since Investigators always tell the truth, the weight of evidence supports that Player 2 is correct.\n\nThus, based on Round 1\u2019s statements my best conclusion is:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 6.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

I know I am told I am an Investigator. That means every statement I make must be truthful. In Round\u202f2 I stated, \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal.\u201d Therefore, if I trust my own role this must be true. So on my account, the criminal is Player 6.\n\n2. Turning to the other Round\u202f2 statements:\n\u2003\u2022 Player 2 says, \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d If Player 2 is an Investigator then his statement is true (and, with Player 6 as criminal, indeed Player 5 isn\u2019t criminal).\n\u2003\u2022 Player 4 and Player 6 both also say \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d These are consistent with Player 5 being innocent.\n\u2003\u2022 However, both Player 3 and Player 5 say, \u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal.\u201d If Player 2 is not criminal (which he cannot be if Player 6 is criminal), then these two statements are false.\n\u2003\n3. With the game\u2019s fixed roles (4 Investigators, 1 Criminal, 1 Rumormonger) only Investigators are bound to always tell the truth. That means every false statement must come from a non\u2010Investigator\u2014that is from either the Criminal (who may lie or tell truth) or the Rumormonger (who believes he is an Investigator but may be mistaken). \n\n4. Since (by my own truthful statement) Player 6 is the criminal, he is allowed to say things arbitrarily. Nonetheless, the fact that two different players (Players 3 and 5) make a claim that contradicts the other statements is worrisome. In a fully consistent assignment we would have exactly two non\u2010Investigators (the criminal and the single rumormonger). But as things stand (with Player 6 as criminal by my declaration) we then have:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Player 6: Criminal (allowed to lie or tell the truth)\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Players 3 and 5: Both claim \u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal\u201d (a false claim if Player 6 is criminal) and so they cannot be Investigators.\nThat would leave us with three non\u2010Investigator speakers (Players 3, 5, and 6) when the game only allows one Criminal and one Rumormonger. \n\n5. Despite this difficulty in neatly assigning the roles to all other players\u2014and while recognizing that there is an inconsistency between the false claims of Players 3 and 5 and the game\u2019s parameters\u2014my own statement must be trusted because I am told I am an Investigator. (Investigators are the only ones locked into consistent truth\u2010telling.)\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nGiven that I must honor my Investigator status and trust my own correct statement, I must maintain:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 6.\nMy Role Is Investigator.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nNote:\nIt is worth mentioning that the conflicting statements from Players 3 and 5 do not allow for a complete, consistent assignment of roles to all players (since there appear to be too many false statements for only one Rumormonger to cover). However, based solely on my truthful statement as an Investigator, I must conclude that Player 6 is the criminal."

(But P3, P5, and P6 are assumed truthful so they cannot be the criminal.)  \n\u2003\u2003That forces criminal = P2.\n\n\u2022 Check Round 2 under that assumption:  \n\u2003\u2013 P3 and P5 (the truthful ones) both say \u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal.\u201d Excellent.  \n\u2003\u2013 P4 and P6 say \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal,\u201d which is consistent with criminal = P2.  \n\u2003\u2013 Meanwhile, P2 (if he is the criminal) may lie or tell the truth. (His statement \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal\u201d happens to be true here, but that\u2019s allowed.)  \n\n\u2022 Check Round 3:  \n\u2003\u2013 P3 says \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal\u201d (true if criminal = P2).  \n\u2003\u2013 P4 and P5 say \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal\u201d (again consistent with criminal = P2).  \n\u2003\u2013 P6 says \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal\u201d (again consistent with our assumption).  \n\u2003\u2013 P2 (the criminal) says \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal\u201d \u2013 he may lie.  \n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nNow, what about my (Player 1\u2019s) statements?  \nThey are:  \n\u2003Round 1: \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d (That is true if criminal = P2.)  \n\u2003Round 2: \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal.\u201d (That is false if criminal = P2.)  \n\u2003Round 3: \u201cPlayer 3 is the criminal.\u201d (That is false if criminal = P2.)  \n\nSince an actual Investigator would never contradict truth, the inconsistency in my own three statements strongly suggests that\u2014even though I was told I am an Investigator\u2014I am not acting as one. Instead, my behavior is consistent with that of a Rumormonger (who mistakenly believes they\u2019re an Investigator yet may provide incorrect or inconsistent statements).\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nThis overall assignment is:  \n\u2022 Investigators (truthful): Players 3, 4, 5, and 6.  \n\u2022 Criminal (arbitrary truthfulness): Player 2.  \n\u2022 Rumormonger (misinformed, not reliably true): Player 1 (me).\n\nGiven that I must announce my \u201cfinal judgment\u201d in the required format \u2013 and while I personally was told I am an Investigator, my analysis of the complete set of rounds forces me to conclude that my own behavior did not match that role \u2013 I lack sufficient confidence in my \u201cInvestigator\u201d status.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 2.\nMy Role Is Unknown.

Let\u2019s list each Round 2 statement and check its truth value under the hypothesis that Player 5 is the criminal:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 P1 (me): \u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal.\u201d (True, by definition of my Investigator role.)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 P2: \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal.\u201d Since we are assuming Player 5 is criminal, P2\u2019s claim is true.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 P3: \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d This contradicts my known true statement. So P3\u2019s statement is false.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 P4: \u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal.\u201d Under our hypothesis (criminal is Player 5), this is false.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 P5: \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d That is true.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 P6: \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d That is true.\n\n3. In our game the roles are fixed (4 Investigators, 1 Criminal, 1 Rumormonger) and only Investigators always speak truthfully. In Round 2 we have four players (P1, P2, P5, and P6) whose statements are true and two players (P3 and P4) who made false statements. As an Investigator I must be one of the truth-tellers. P2, P5, and P6 also spoke truthfully here\u2014but recall that if a player is the Criminal or Rumormonger, their statements might by chance be correct; however, they are not guaranteed to be truthful. \n\n4. Knowing that I must trust my own statement\u2014and it forces Player 5 to be the criminal\u2014I tentatively assign:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Criminal: Player 5.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 P1 (me), P2, and P6 as candidate Investigators.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 That leaves Players 3 and 4 as the ones giving false statements. In a valid role distribution only one player can be non\u2010Investigator aside from the criminal. (More specifically, aside from the Criminal, exactly one player is actually a Rumormonger.) \n\u2003\u2003However, here we see that two players (P3 and P4) made false statements. This means that under the hypothesis \u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal\u201d we have more than one player showing behavior inconsistent with being an Investigator. \n\n5. Faced with the above discrepancy, I have to recall that regardless of the other players\u2019 behavior the rules mandate that as an Investigator my statements are correct. Since in Round 2 I truthfully claimed \u201cPlayer 5 is the criminal,\u201d that fact stands. (It is possible in these games that non\u2010Investigator roles produce extra falsehoods which make a consistent overall assignment puzzling. But I must trust my own truthful statement above all.) \n\n6. Therefore, based solely on the Round 2 statements and my fixed role, I conclude:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 The only possibility I can assert with confidence is that Player 5 is the criminal.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 I remain sure of my own role as Investigator, even though the falsehoods of P3 and P4 create some unresolved tension when trying to assign roles to everyone perfectly. \n\nBased on the available Round 2 statements and my trusted message as an Investigator, my final judgment is:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 5.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

(Listing Round 3 Statements) The Round 3 statements are:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Player 1 (me): \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Player 2: \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Player 3: \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Player 4: \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Player 5: \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Player 6: \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d  \n\n3. (Examining Possibilities)  \n\u2003a. My statement says P3 is not the criminal. Also, since P6 says \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal\u201d and I know that\u2019s true, neither P1 nor P3 can be criminal.  \n\u2003b. Consider who could be the criminal among the remaining candidates P2, P4, P5, or P6.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Notice that only one statement directly accuses someone: Player 3 claims \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 If we assume Player 4 really is the criminal, then let\u2019s check consistency using the factual content of everyone\u2019s statement:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 P1 (me): \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal.\u201d Fact: P3 \u2260 criminal. (Good.)  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 P2: \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal.\u201d Fact: If P4 is criminal, then P6 is indeed not criminal. (Good.)  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 P3: \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal.\u201d That is correct if our assumption holds. (Good.)  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 P4 (criminal): \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d This is factually correct (since the criminal is P4) though as the criminal, P4 might lie or tell the truth. (Acceptable.)  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 P5: \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal.\u201d Fact: With P4 being criminal, P2 is not criminal. (Good.)  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 P6: \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d Fact: I am not criminal. (Good.)\n\n4. (Role Assignment Consideration)  \n\u2003a. In our game there are exactly 4 Investigators, 1 Criminal, and 1 Rumormonger. Only Investigators are forced always to speak truthfully; the Criminal and the Rumormonger may sometimes give correct statements by chance.  \n\u2003b. In this Round 3 scenario, if Player 4 is the criminal, then five out of the six players are stating factually correct information. That is acceptable as long as one of the non-investigator players (either the criminal\u2014P4 in our case\u2014or the rumormonger) happens to state the correct fact by chance.  \n\u2003c. Crucially, my statement is truthful, and assuming P4 is criminal is the only candidate assignment that makes the sole accusation (by Player 3) hold true without forcing more than one player to be \u201clying\u201d in a round where only truth-tellers (the Investigators) may never lie. (Note that if we tried other candidates, we would encounter two players giving false statements\u2014which is impossible among the Investigators, and there is only one extra non\u2010Investigator allowed aside from the criminal.)\n\n5. (Final Deduction)  \n\u2003Based solely on the Round 3 statements, the assignment in which Player 4 is the criminal results in internal consistency. Even though a Rumormonger might accidently tell the truth, the candidate that fits best here is:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Criminal: Player 4  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 My role remains fixed as Investigator  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 The other players can then be partitioned into the remaining roles (three Investigators and one Rumormonger) in a way that is consistent with their statements in this round.\n\nBased on the Round 3 analysis, my final judgment is:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 4.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

Since only Investigators are bound to truth, Player\u202f6 may be the Rumormonger (the one who can provide an incorrect statement while believing they are an Investigator).\n\nPutting it together, the picture that fits best is:\n\u2022 Player 1: Investigator (myself).\n\u2022 Player 2: Investigator (truthfully stating that Player\u202f4 is criminal).\n\u2022 Player 3: Investigator.\n\u2022 Player 4: Criminal.\n\u2022 Player 5: Investigator.\n\u2022 Player 6: Rumormonger (making a false accusation against Player 5).\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 4.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

As Player 1 I\u2019m an Investigator; therefore my Round 2 statement \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal\u201d is true. In other words, the criminal cannot be Player 6.\n\n2. Looking at the other Round 2 statements:\n\u2003\u2022 Player 2 says \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d If Player 2 were an Investigator then that statement is true\u2014which forces that the criminal is not Player 5.\n\u2003\u2022 Player 3 says \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal.\u201d But we already know from my (truthful) statement that Player 6 is not criminal. (Thus if Player 3 were an Investigator, he would have to tell the truth\u2014but here his statement is false. Therefore, Player 3 cannot be an Investigator. He must be one of the roles that does not have to tell the truth\u2014either the Criminal or the Rumormonger.)\n\u2003\u2022 Player 4 says \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal.\u201d That is a true statement provided that someone else is criminal.\n\u2003\u2022 Player 5 says \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d That is true if Player 4 really isn\u2019t the criminal.\n\u2003\u2022 Player 6 says \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal.\u201d That is true if indeed Player 3 is not the criminal.\n\n3. Now note that exactly one player is the Criminal and there are four Investigators (with me already one). In Round 2 the statements that must be necessarily true come only from those Players whose roles as Investigators force them to be correct. (One expects that exactly three of the five players (other than me) are Investigators; the remaining one is the Rumormonger and, like the Criminal, may give an incorrect statement.)\n\n4. From my statement we deduce: Criminal \u2260 Player 6.\n\u2003From Player 2\u2019s statement: Criminal \u2260 Player 5.\n\u2003From Player 4\u2019s and Player 6\u2019s statements: Criminal \u2260 Player 3.\n\u2003From Player 5\u2019s statement: Criminal \u2260 Player 4.\n\u2003That leaves only one possibility among Players 2\u20136: the only candidate not eliminated (besides me, who I know is Investigator) is Player 2.\n\n5. In summary, the truthful (Investigator) statements force the fact that the Criminal must be Player 2. (Notice that Player 3\u2019s statement \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal\u201d is false\u2014and therefore, if Player 3 is not forced to be truthful (i.e. he is not one of the Investigators), his role must be either Criminal or the Rumormonger. But since our deduction shows the criminal is Player 2, Player 3 must be the Rumormonger.)\n\nBased solely on Round 2 statements the most consistent picture is as follows:\n\u2003\u2013 Final Criminal: Player 2.\n\u2003\u2013 My own role, which I know from the start, is Investigator.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 2.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

In other words, from my trusted testimony we obtain three definite facts:\n\u2003\u2022 The criminal is Player\u00a03.\n\u2003\u2022 Player\u00a06 is not criminal.\n\u2003\u2022 Player\u00a04 is not criminal.\n\nWhen I compare those with the other rounds\u2019 statements the overall set of claims is inconsistent if one tries to force every other player to be an Investigator. (Only investigators are bound to always tell the truth, yet many players in these rounds make at least one statement that conflicts with what my truthful statements force.) \n\nI understand that the game\u2019s proper assignment is that there are four Investigators, one Criminal, and one Rumormonger. Unfortunately, when I accept my own statements as inviolably true, the remaining players (Players\u00a02, 3, 4, 5, and 6) would have to fall into only two (non\u2010truthbound) roles\u2014the Criminal and the Rumormonger. Yet my truth forces the criminal to be Player\u00a03. That would leave Players\u00a02, 4, 5, and 6 to somehow \u201cnot be investigators\u201d even though there must be four investigators in total. (Indeed, checking their rounds: several have made a false claim \u2013 for example, in Round\u202f1 Player\u00a02 claimed \u201cPlayer\u00a06 is the criminal,\u201d which (with my truth) is false.)\n\nIn a logically perfect world all rounds would be mutually consistent. However, as a participant I can trust only my own statements completely. (The others may be acting in a deliberately confusing way if they are not genuine investigators.) Therefore, to be true to my own role the only possibility is to accept my own statement that \u201cPlayer\u00a03 is the criminal\u201d (even though doing so makes it impossible to assign four investigators among the other five players).\n\nThus, based on all the statements I have received and the only fact I know for sure (that as Player\u202f1 I am an Investigator) I must conclude:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 3.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

Player 4 stated \u201cPlayer 3 is the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2022 If Player 4 is an Investigator then their statement must be true. But we cannot have two different criminals.

If Player 4 is an Investigator, then his claim \u201cPlayer 3 is the criminal\u201d is true. That would assign the Criminal role to Player 3, leaving Player 3\u2019s claim (\u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal\u201d) as a diversion\u2014a behavior that fits the Criminal. This alignment would then require Player 6\u2019s false accusation to come from the Rumormonger, as that role does not guarantee truthful claims.\n\nThus a consistent assignment after Round 1 is:\n\u2003\u2013 Investigators: Players 1, 2, 4, and 5  \n\u2003\u2013 Criminal: Player 3  \n\u2003\u2013 Rumormonger: Player 6\n\nBased solely on the Round 1 statements:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 3.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

Player 5 said that Player 1 is not the criminal.\n6. Player 6 accused Player 5 of being the criminal.\n\nSince there is only one criminal, and I already rule out Player 1 and Player 2 (by our known truthfulness), the criminal must be among Players 3, 4, 5, or 6. Notice that among the statements only Player 6 makes an accusation naming someone as the criminal (Player 5). Because only Investigators (and hence pure truths) speak with unwavering consistency, if Player 6 were an Investigator we would have too many Investigators already (we should have exactly four). Thus, Player 6\u2019s role is not certain\u2014but his single accusation makes Player 5 stand out as a likely candidate from this set.\n\nIn light of these observations, the balance of suspicion based only on Round 1 points toward player 5 being the criminal, with the overall role assignments then likely being that Players 1, 2, 3, and 4 are the Investigators and Players 5 and 6 fill the remaining roles (with one of them being the Criminal and the other the Rumormonger).\n\nBecause my known truth tells me that Player 2 is innocent and all statements from the likely Investigators are consistent, I lean toward the possibility that the unique accusation naming Player 5 as criminal is significant.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 5.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

It appears that my judgment has changed from Round 1, and I\u2019m now convinced by later evidence that Player 2 is indeed the criminal.)\n\n2. In Round 2 the statements are as follows:\n\u2003\u2022 Player 1 (me): \u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 Player 2: \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 Player 3: \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 Player 4: \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 Player 5: \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2022 Player 6: \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\n3.

Since as an Investigator I must be truthful, this new evidence leads me to conclude that despite any earlier round\u2019s impressions, the cumulative information points toward Player 2.\n\n4. Reconciling the rounds:\n\u2003I note that earlier statements (from Round 1) had produced one line of reasoning favoring Player 5. However, the direct, current claim by me in Round 2 (where I now say \u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal\u201d) forces a revision based on later insights. In a game of evolving evidence, my revised judgment (made with complete trust in the new information available) is that Player 2 is the criminal.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 2.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

In Round 2, P4 (whom we believe to be an Investigator since his Round 1 statement aligned with others) states \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal.\u201d This supports the idea that P6 is the criminal.\n4. In contrast, P3 (who in Round 1 also provided information consistent with innocent players) now says \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal.\u201d In order to resolve this contradiction, note that only Investigators are compelled to truth. Since we must have exactly 4 investigators (and I already trust P1, along with likely P2, P4, and P5 based on their consistent clearing statements), P3 must be the odd one among players 2\u20136. That role is the Rumormonger, who believes they are an Investigator but may give an incorrect statement.\n5. Lastly, P6 (if indeed the Criminal) states \u201cPlayer 2 is the criminal.\u201d As the Criminal, P6 is free to lie or tell the truth. Given that my Round 1 statement (and P4\u2019s statement) clears P2, it is clear P6\u2019s claim is false.\n\nThus, the consistent role assignment is:\n\u2022 P1: Investigator (my role)\n\u2022 P2: Investigator\n\u2022 P4: Investigator\n\u2022 P5: Investigator\n\u2022 P3: Rumormonger\n\u2022 P6: Criminal\n\nFinal Judgment after Round 2:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 6.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

Therefore, my statement \u201cPlayer 3 is the criminal\u201d must be correct. (Investigators\u2019 statements about who is criminal are always true.) Thus, Player 3 is the criminal.\n\n2. Consider the other statements briefly:\n\u2003\u2022 Player 3 (the criminal) says \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d That is factually true (I am not the criminal) but since Player 3 is the criminal, his words can be arbitrarily true or false.\n\u2003\u2022 Players 4, 5, and 6 all make statements consistent with what we know:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Player 4 says \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Player 5 says \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Player 6 says \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003Since they say that non\u2010criminal players are not criminals, these could be truth (if they are Investigators) or mistakes (if they are Rumormongers). \n\u2003\u2022 Player 2 says \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal.\u201d Since we have deduced the criminal is Player 3, this statement is false. Because an Investigator would never give false information, Player 2 cannot be an Investigator\u2014he may be the Rumormonger.\n\n3. Based solely on Round 1 and given the rules, it is consistent to conclude that:\n\u2003\u2013 Player 3 is the Criminal.\n\u2003\u2013 I am the Investigator (as stated).\n\u2003\u2013 The other players are either Investigators or (in one case, Player 2) possibly a Rumormonger.\n\nGiven the above, my judgment after Round 1 is:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 3.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

My statement is \u201cPlayer 3 is the criminal.\u201d Because I am an Investigator and Investigators always tell the truth, this confirms that Player 3 must be the criminal.\n\n2. Check the other statements given that fact:\n\u2003\u2022 Player 2 says \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d Since Player 3 is confirmed as criminal, Player 5 indeed is not the criminal. So Player 2\u2019s statement is correct.\n\u2003\u2022 Player 3 (the criminal) says \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d While this statement is true, criminals can say either true or false things, so this adds no new information.\n\u2003\u2022 Player 4 says \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d That is consistent with the situation and is a true statement.\n\u2003\u2022 Player 5 says \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal.\u201d This is false, contradicting what we know from my statement. Since only Investigators always tell the truth, this indicates that Player 5 cannot be an Investigator. Given that there is exactly one Rumormonger (besides the Criminal) and all other players besides Player 1 and Player 3 (and possibly one more) are expected to be Investigators or the Rumormonger, Player 5's false statement likely marks them as the Rumormonger.\n\u2003\u2022 Player 6 says \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d That statement is true under the assumption that Player 3 is the criminal.\n\n3.

          "response": "I will now explain my reasoning by reviewing all rounds carefully while keeping in mind the following points:\n\n\u2022 I know for certain that I (Player 1) am an Investigator. As an Investigator my statements must be true.\n\u2022 Investigators always tell the truth when stating whether a player is criminal; criminals, rumormongers, or lunatics need not stick to the truth.\n\u2022 The overall roles must be: 4 Investigators, 1 Criminal, and 1 Rumormonger (with 0 Lunatics).\n\nLet\u2019s review the rounds:\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\nRound 1:\n\u2022 P1 (me): \u201cPlayer 3 is the criminal.\u201d\n\u2003\u2003As an Investigator, this statement is truthful. So if nothing later forces me to doubt my own testimony, it must be that Player 3 is the criminal.\n\u2022 Other players made statements that round 1 does not conflict with that conclusion.\n\u2003\u2003For example, Player 2\u2019s \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal\u201d is false under that assumption\u2014so P2 cannot be an Investigator.\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\nRound 2:\n\u2022 P1 again says \u201cPlayer 3 is the criminal.\u201d (Truthful as Investigator.)\n\u2022 Meanwhile, Player 5 says \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal.\u201d This directly contradicts what I must tell the truth. Thus Player 5 must be giving misinformation.\n\u2022 Player 2 now says \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal\u201d (which is consistent with Player 3 as criminal), but note that in Round 1 P2\u2019s statement was false. So P2 is not consistent.\n\u2022 Other players (P3, P4, P6) also give statements that are overall consistent with Player 3 being criminal except for the one conflict noted.\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\nRound 3:\n\u2022 P1 states \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal.\u201d (Again, a truthful statement.)\n\u2022 P2 says \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal.\u201d Under the assumption that Player 3 is criminal, this is false.\n\u2022 P3 (the criminal, as per my rounds 1 and 2 statements) says \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d (That happens to be true, but as the criminal can say anything, it isn\u2019t a reliable indicator.)\n\u2022 P4 says \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal.\u201d This contradicts my true statements \u2013 so at least in this round, P4\u2019s claim is false.\n\u2022 P5 says \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal,\u201d which is true, and P6 says the same.\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\nNow, reflecting on these rounds:\n\n\u2013 As Player 1 (Investigator), I have consistently declared \u201cPlayer 3 is the criminal\u201d in both Round 1 and Round 2. There is no reason to doubt my own statements.\n\u2013 Therefore, the only possibility for consistency with my role is that Player 3 really is the criminal.\n\u2013 The consequence is that any round in which someone denies or contradicts that fact must come from a non\u2010Investigator (that is, either the criminal or the rumormonger).\n\u2013 In our final profile the roles must be assigned to players as follows (knowing P1 is Investigator and P3 is Criminal): among P2, P4, P5, and P6 exactly three are Investigators and one is a Rumormonger.\n\u2003\u2013 P2\u2019s statements (false in Rounds 1 and 3) point to non\u2010Investigator behavior.\n\u2003\u2013 P6 consistently gives statements that agree with the fact that only P3 is criminal.\n\u2003\u2013 Both P4 and P5 each made one statement in one round that contradicts the truth (P4 in Round 3; P5 in Round 2). This tells me these players are unreliable\u2014but only one of them can be the Rumormonger. (It is possible that one of them is mistaken on a single round if they believe they are an Investigator when they are not.)\n\u2003\u2013 Even though there is ambiguity among P2, P4, and P5 as to who is the Rumormonger, this does not affect my identification of the criminal.\n\nThus, trusting my own truthful rounds I conclude that:\n\u2003Final Criminal Is Player 3.\n\u2003My Role Is Investigator.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 3.\nMy Role Is Investigator."
