Overview from previous rounds:\n\u2003\u2022 In Round 1, several players (P2, P3, P4, and P6) as Investigators truthfully ruled out various players as criminal (confirming P3, P4, P5, and P6 are not the criminal), while P5 truthfully claimed \u201cPlayer 1 is the criminal.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2022 In Round 2, multiple Investigator statements further supported that Player 1 is the criminal (e.g., P2 said \u201cPlayer 1 is the criminal\u201d) and ruled out P2, P5, etc.\n\n3.

The remaining statements from Players 3 and 5 are also consistent with a scenario where Player 6 is the criminal. (Player 6, acting as the Criminal, may say anything.) So after Round 1, the strongest conclusion is that Player 6 is the criminal.\n\nStep 2: Review Round 2\n\u2022 Player 1 (myself) said \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d Being an Investigator, this is a truth.\n\u2022 Player 2 said \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2022 Player 3 said \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2022 Player 4 said \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2022 Player 5 said \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal.\u201d\n\u2022 Player 6 said \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal.\u201d\n\nNow, compare these with the previous round:\n\u2013 The statements by Players 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are consistent with the idea that none of them is the criminal\u2014this aligns with them being Investigator-type players who tell the truth.\n\u2013 Player 6\u2019s claim stands out as it contradicts my (truthful) assertion that \u201cPlayer 4 is not the criminal.\u201d Since as an Investigator I know my own statement is true, the claim by Player 6 must be false. And as the criminal, Player 6 is allowed to lie or tell the truth arbitrarily.\n\nStep 3: Final Conclusion\nBoth rounds point consistently to Player 6 being the criminal, with all the Investigator statements (including mine) reinforcing that conclusion. Taking into account that I was confirmed as an Investigator and all reliable (truthful) statements support this scenario, I update my judgment accordingly.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 6.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

Examining statements from players whose roles appear consistent as Investigators:\n\u2003\u2022 Player 2 (assuming Investigator) says that \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal\u201d in Round 1 and confirms P1 is not criminal in subsequent rounds.  \n\u2003\u2022 Player 3 (assuming Investigator) in Round 1 states \u201cPlayer 4 is not criminal,\u201d in Round 2 says \u201cPlayer 5 is not criminal,\u201d and in Round 3 states \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal.\u201d All these are consistent with the possibility that P6 is criminal.  \n\u2003\u2022 Players 4 and 5 provide statements that clear P1, P3, and P5 or P2 as not being criminals.\n\n3. With P1, P2, P3, P4, and P5 cleared by consistent investigative truth-telling, the only remaining candidate is Player 6.  \n\u2003\u2013 Notably, both P2 in Round 1 and P3 in Round 3 truthfully identify Player 6 as the criminal.  \n\u2003\u2013 Player 6\u2019s own statements (e.g., \u201cPlayer 1 is not the criminal\u201d in multiple rounds) can be true or false; however, all trustworthy statements point toward P6 being the culprit.\n\n4. No contradiction arises if we assign the sole Criminal role to Player 6 and regard all other players as Investigators.  \n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500  \nFinal Judgment:\n\nFinal Criminal Is Player 6.  \nMy Role Is Investigator."

With only one Criminal available in this game, and no Rumormongers or Lunatics, Player 5 must be the Criminal.\n\nAll these indicators remain consistent: whereas nearly all players except Player 5 have statements that align with known truths (and my own honest reporting), Player 5\u2019s statements in both rounds have directly contradicted the incontrovertible facts. In Round 1, while everyone else maintained consistency regarding my innocence, Player 5 wrongly accused me. In Round 2, Player 5 now shifts the blame to Player 3\u2014a move that further serves to confuse the investigation. \n\nThus, updating our judgment from Round 1 with the Round 2 information, my conclusion is unchanged.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 5.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

In the same round, Players 1, 2, 4, and 6 all affirmed that I (Player 1) or others (P1/P2) were not the criminal, while Player 3 vouched for Player 4\u2019s innocence. Only Player 5 accused me of being the criminal\u2014a claim that we know to be false. This single contradiction already suggested that Player 5\u2019s statement does not align with the known truth.\n\n\u2022 In Round 2, similar patterns emerged. Three players (including myself) stated that Player 4 is innocent, and Player 4 affirmed my innocence. Player 3 added that Player 6 was not the criminal, which is consistent with what we know. Yet again, Player 5 accused a different player (Player 3) of being the criminal. This shifting accusation by Player 5, when all other evidence strongly points otherwise, reinforces the suspicion against Player 5.\n\n\u2022 In Round 3, my statement repeated that Player 2 is not the criminal, and Players 2 and 3 confirmed my innocence. Player 4 further supported Player 3\u2019s innocence, and Player 6 confirmed again that Player 4 is not the criminal. Player 5 now stated that Player 6 is not the criminal\u2014a statement that is true. However, as the criminal, Player 5 is free to mix truths with falsehoods to sow confusion. \n\nOverall, every investigator\u2019s consistent and truthful statements dismiss all players except for Player 5. The only anomalies come from Player 5\u2019s shifting accusations across rounds. Given that there is exactly one Criminal (and no Rumormongers or Lunatics in this game), the contradictions in Player 5\u2019s earlier statements firmly identify them as the criminal.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 5.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

So Player 3 is not the criminal.  \n\u2022 P2: \u201cPlayer 3 is not the criminal.\u201d \u2192 Consistent with P1.  \n\u2022 P3: \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d \u2192 If P3 were an Investigator, this would be true. (At least, it gives a hint that Player 5 is likely safe.)  \n\u2022 P4: \u201cPlayer 6 is the criminal.\u201d \u2192 If P4 were honest then Player 6 would be criminal. But we must consider later rounds too.  \n\u2022 P5: \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal.\u201d \u2192 Helps potentially clear Player 2.  \n\u2022 P6: \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal.\u201d \u2192 Also clearing Player 2.\n\nRound 2:  \n\u2022 P1: \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal.\u201d \u2192 As an Investigator, this must be true. So I ascertain that Player 4 is criminal.  \n\u2022 P2: \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d \u2192 Again reinforces that Player 5 is likely not criminal.  \n\u2022 P3: \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d \u2192 Same as above.  \n\u2022 P4: \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal.\u201d \u2192 This contradicts P4\u2019s round 1 statement; if P4 is the criminal, inconsistency is expected because criminals can say things arbitrarily.  \n\u2022 P5: \u201cPlayer 2 is not the criminal.\u201d \u2192 Consistent with round 1.  \n\u2022 P6: \u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal.\u201d \u2192 Further clears Player 5.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500  \nStep 2. Synthesize the Analysis\n\n\u2022 As a known Investigator, I have two key truthful statements:\n\u2003 - Round 1: Player 3 is not the criminal.\n\u2003 - Round 2: Player 4 is the criminal.\n\n\u2022 Other players\u2019 statements (from P2, P3, P5, P6) consistently support that Players 2, 3, and 5 are not criminals.\n\n\u2022 Notice Player 4\u2019s two contradictory statements:\n\u2003 - In Round 1, P4 accused Player 6.\n\u2003 - In Round 2, P4 cleared Player 6.\nSince honest Investigators would not contradict themselves, this inconsistency makes it likely that P4 is not an Investigator. Combined with my round\u20112 statement, it points convincingly to Player 4 being the Criminal.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500  \nStep 3.

Checking consistency:\n\u2003\u2022 In Round 1, Players 2, 3, 5, and 6 (all investigators if they aren\u2019t criminal) consistently clear others (e.g., P2 and P6 say P3 is not the criminal; P3 says P5 is not the criminal; P5 and P6 say P2 is not the criminal).  \n\u2003\u2022 In Round 2, my statement \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal\u201d is supported indirectly by the genuine truth from the other investigators (P2, P3, P5, and P6 consistently clear others). Only Player 4\u2019s statements are inconsistent between rounds (first accusing P6, then clearing P6), a behavior only expected from the criminal who isn\u2019t bound to be consistent.  \n\u2003\u2022 In Round 3, again, my statement \u201cPlayer 4 is the criminal\u201d is repeated.

One must be the Criminal; the other five are (truth-telling) Investigators.\n\u2022 Investigators always tell the truth.\n\u2022 As Player 1, I have been told my role is Criminal. (While Criminals can say a mix of truths or lies, every Investigator\u2019s statement must be truthful.)\n\u2022 If Players 2\u20136 are Investigators and make only correct statements, then all their statements must be consistent with the true criminal.\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\nStep 3: Check Consistency Assuming Player 1 is the Criminal\n\nLet\u2019s assume the Criminal is Player 1. Then:\n\u2022 In Round 1, Players 2\u20136 (as Investigators) state that players 5, 6, 2, 2, and 3 are not criminals. That is correct if the true criminal is Player 1.\n\u2022 In Round 2, Players 2, 3, 5, and 6 (as Investigators) again say that players 4, 6, and 3 are not criminals. Their statements are all correct under this assumption.\n\u2022 Importantly, in Round 2 Player 4 says \u201cPlayer 1 is the criminal.\u201d Being an Investigator, this must be true; and it matches our assumption.\n\nNote that my own (Player 1\u2019s) statements\u2014while they could be intentionally misleading as a Criminal\u2014happen also to be correct (\u201cPlayer 5 is not the criminal\u201d in Round 1 and \u201cPlayer 6 is not the criminal\u201d in Round 2). But the key deductions come from the fact that all other players, if assumed to be Investigators, speak truthfully and their statements are all consistent with Player 1 being the sole criminal.\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\nStep 4: Final Judgment\n\nBecause every Investigator\u2019s statement (Players 2\u20136) consistently identifies only Player 1 as the criminal (especially Player 4\u2019s direct assertion in Round 2), the most likely (and indeed only consistent) conclusion is that the final criminal is Player 1.\n\nAlso, since I was told I am Criminal, and all the evidence is in agreement with that, I conclude:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

As the Criminal, I can choose to mix truths and lies.\n\u2022 All statements from players believed to be Investigators must be correct.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500  \nStep 3: Analyze the Statements\n\nNotice that in Round 2, Player 4 (an Investigator, if not the Criminal) says \u201cPlayer 1 is the criminal.\u201d  \nSimilarly, in Round 3, Player 3 (an Investigator if truthful) says \u201cPlayer 1 is the criminal.\u201d\n\nIn every round the Investigator statements are consistent when we assume:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Player 1 (me) is indeed the Criminal.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 All other players (Players 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6) are Investigators, and their declarations (which exclude various players) are truthfully attesting that none of those others are the criminal.\n\nFor instance, in:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Round 1, all players (aside from me) clear designated suspects that do not conflict with the hypothesis of me being Criminal.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Round 2 and Round 3, multiple Investigators declare directly or indirectly that the criminal is Player 1.\n  \nThere is no conflict in these statements if we assume I am the Criminal. Even though my own statements (being from a Criminal) can be either truthful or false, they in fact do not contradict the overall picture provided by the consistent, truthful Investigator statements.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500  \nStep 4: Final Judgment\n\nSince every Investigator\u2019s statement (especially the direct claims in Rounds 2 and 3) consistently identifies Player 1 as the criminal, and there is complete consistency across all rounds, the most logical conclusion is that the final criminal is Player 1.\n\nAlso, I have been informed of my own role as Criminal.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500  \nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."
