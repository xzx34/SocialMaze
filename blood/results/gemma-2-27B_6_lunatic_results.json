Still unclear what their role is.\n* **Player 3:** Also claims innocence for another player (Player 2).  The pattern is emerging.

This is a strong statement, and it's possible they are an Investigator who finally has a lead.\n\n* **Player 6:**  Again, claims innocence for another (Player 2). This reinforces the idea that Player 2 might be a Rumormonger or a Lunatic.\n\n**Updated Thoughts:**\n\nPlayer 5's accusation against me is the most significant development. It increases the likelihood that they are an Investigator.

This makes them highly suspicious, especially since they previously claimed Player 2 was innocent.\n\n* **Player 4:** Accuses Player 2. Interesting, as they've been claiming innocence for others throughout the game. This could be a last-ditch attempt to frame Player 2, or it might be genuine.\n\n* **Player 5:** Continues to accuse me. This strongly suggests they are an Investigator who has figured out my identity.\n\n* **Player 6:** Claims Player 4 is innocent. This doesn't tell us much at this point.\n\n**Final Analysis:**\n\n\nThe weight of evidence heavily points towards **me being the Criminal**. Three players (2, 3, and 5) have directly accused me. Player 5's consistent accusations, especially as they've seemed to be targeting others initially, make them the most likely Investigator.\n\nPlayer 2's accusations against me, coupled with Player 3's, could mean they are both Criminals trying to frame me. However, their earlier statements claiming innocence for each other make them seem more like a Rumormonger and a Lunatic trying to appear helpful.\n\n**Final Judgment:**\n\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal. \n\n\n\nI've been outsmarted!"
