Player 2 *still* insists Player 5 is the criminal.\n*   **Player 2** is now being accused by both Player 3 and Player 6.

This suggests Player 4 is likely an Investigator.\n\nIf Player 2 is the criminal, their statements could be deliberately misleading. Player 2 consistently pointing the finger at Player 5 could be a distraction. The accusations against Player 2 from Players 3 and 6 are also suspicious \u2013 perhaps they are trying to deflect blame if they are involved.\n\nConsidering the evidence, Player 2 is the most likely criminal. The consistency of accusations against them, combined with the shift in focus away from Player 5, is compelling.

Three players (2, 3, and 5) are directly accusing me of being the criminal. That\u2019s a strong signal. This could mean several things:\n\n*   **They are Investigators:** This is the most straightforward explanation. Three investigators pointing at me is damning.\n*   **They are Rumormongers:** If they *believe* they are investigators, they could be genuinely mistaken, but all pointing at me simultaneously is still a bit suspicious.\n*   **They are Lunatics:** This is less likely, as Lunatics are supposed to believe *they* are the criminal, and therefore might be less inclined to accuse others so directly.\n\nPlayer 4 defending Player 2, and Player 6 defending Player 5, are also noteworthy. These could be linked \u2013 perhaps these players are working together, or are both non-investigators trying to deflect.\n\nMy initial suspicion of Player 3 seems less likely now. The overwhelming focus on *me* suggests that Player 3 is likely not the criminal. I initially thought the cluster around Player 3 in Round 1 was a deliberate misdirection, but it now seems more likely those were Rumormongers or Lunatics.\n\nGiven the three direct accusations, and knowing I *am* the criminal, I'm starting to suspect that Players 2, 3, and 5 are likely Investigators. If that\u2019s the case, I'm in a difficult position.\n\nSince I know I'm the criminal, and three players are accusing me, my role is confirmed.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role "

This is the strongest pattern we have. This strongly suggests they are *not* Investigators. My suspicion is leaning towards Player 4 being the Lunatic\u2014the continued, unwavering defense despite the shifting accusations from others seems less strategic and more\u2026fixed.\n\nPlayer 5 defending Player 2 is not particularly revealing on its own.\n\nGiven the direct accusation from Player 6, and the consistency of Players 3 & 4, I still believe I am the only criminal.

Remember, my initial assessment pointed towards Player 4 being the Criminal.\n\n*   **If Player 4 is the Criminal:** This would mean Player 6 is telling the truth about Player 4 not being the criminal. Player 5 is lying about me not being the criminal. Players 2, 3, and 4 are all telling the truth. This scenario is increasingly likely.\n*   **If Player 6 is the Criminal:** I (Player 1) would be telling the truth, which is impossible. So, Player 6 isn't the criminal.\n*   **If Player 3 is the Criminal:** Player 2 is telling the truth. Player 3 is lying about Player 5. Player 4 is telling the truth. This doesn't easily fit with the Round 1 statements.\n*   **If Player 5 is the Criminal:** Player 3 is telling the truth. Player 5 is lying about me. This doesn't fit well with Round 1.\n\nNotice a pattern? Players 2, 3, and 4 all deny accusations against themselves or Player 3. This is *very* suspicious. If they were genuine Investigators, they should be focused on identifying the actual criminal, not shielding each other. This cluster of denials strongly suggests a coordinated effort to deflect suspicion.\n\nPlayer 5\u2019s statement that I am *not* the criminal is also interesting. If Player 4 is the criminal, Player 5 is lying, which is consistent. If Player 5 is a Rumormonger believing they're an Investigator, they could be incorrectly stating I am not the criminal.\n\nGiven the information, Player 4 remains the most likely candidate for the criminal. The combined denials from Players 2, 3, and 4, along with Player 5's statement about me, make this increasingly clear.\n\nI continue to believe I am the Criminal, as that's what I was told. However, the possibility of being a Lunatic making seemingly random statements remains, though it seems less likely now.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 4.\nMy Role "

My assessment has consistently pointed towards Player 4 being the Criminal.\n\n*   **If Player 4 is the Criminal:** This round solidifies that suspicion. Player 3 is lying (protecting Player 4), Player 4 is lying (protecting themself), and Player 6 is likely an investigator trying to protect Player 1. Players 1, 2 and 5 are also lying. This fits the pattern perfectly.\n*   **If Player 3 is the Criminal:** I (Player 1) would be telling the truth, which is impossible.\n*   **If Player 6 is the Criminal:** Player 2 would be telling the truth, and Player 5 would be lying.

Players 3 and 4 *directly* protect Player 4, and Player 2 and 5 protect Player 6. Player 6 then returns the favor by protecting me, Player 1. This coordinated protection strongly indicates that Player 4 is the Criminal, and Players 2, 3, 5, and 6 are all complicit in covering for them or are misinformed.\n\nGiven the consistent evidence across all three rounds, I am highly confident in my assessment.

It could mean they are protecting an ally, or simply don\u2019t believe Player 2\u2019s new accusation against Player 3.\n\n**Role Refinement:**\n\n* **Investigators:** Player 3 seems increasingly likely to be an Investigator.\n* **Criminal:** Still me (Player 1).\n* **Lunatic:** Player 4 is a strong candidate. The unwavering focus on me feels like a Lunatic attempting to fulfill what they *believe* is their role. Player 6 is also a possibility, but less strong than Player 4.\n* **Rumormonger:** Player 2 is a strong candidate. The shifting accusation suggests unreliable information, consistent with a Rumormonger. Player 5 could also be a Rumormonger, providing potentially incorrect information.\n\n**Current Best Guess:**\n\nI believe Player 3 is a highly likely Investigator. Players 4 and 6 are suspicious, and I lean towards Player 4 being the Lunatic. Player 2 and 5 are likely misinforming, potentially Rumormongers.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role "

We're seeing a clear alliance forming or being revealed. Players 3, 4, and 6 are all defending each other. This is *very* suspicious, and suggests they are likely Investigators protecting each other.\n\nPlayer 2 continuing to accuse Player 4, while being defended by Player 3, reinforces the idea that Player 2 is likely a Rumormonger or a misguided player.\n\nPlayer 5 defending Player 6 is less clear, and could be either a genuine belief or a further attempt to muddy the waters.\n\nThe fact that I (Player 1) and Player 6 both deny Player 4 is the criminal is a curious coincidence. It could be a deliberate attempt to mislead, or it could be Player 6 trying to appear innocent.\n\n**Role Refinement & Finalization:**\n\n* **Investigators:** Players 3, 4, and 6 are *highly* likely to be Investigators. Their mutual defense is too strong to ignore.\n* **Criminal:** Still me (Player 1).\n* **Rumormonger:** Player 2 is the strongest candidate. Their accusations are inconsistent and often target those being defended by potential Investigators.\n* **Lunatic:** Player 5 is the most likely candidate. They are the only one not clearly aligned with the Investigators or actively trying to mislead. Their statement is generally innocuous, fitting with a Lunatic's confused state.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nThe clear pattern of mutual defense among Players 3, 4, and 6 strongly suggests they are the Investigators. Player 2 is consistently providing misleading information, which points to them being the Rumormonger. Player 5 is the most likely candidate for the Lunatic.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role "

The fact that three players deny Player 5 being the criminal suggests Player 5 is likely *not* the criminal.\n\nPlayer 2 directly accusing me is interesting.

Player 4 *also* accuses Player 2. This is very significant. Two players independently accusing Player 2 increases the likelihood they are the Criminal.\n\nPlayers 2, 3, and 5 continue to deny Player 5 is the criminal. This consistency suggests Player 5 is likely innocent. Player 6 also denies Player 3 is the criminal.\n\nLet's consider the roles:\n\n*   **Investigators:** Would likely agree on the criminal. The convergence on Player 2 suggests at least one, and potentially more, Investigators.\n*   **Criminal:** I'm trying to deflect suspicion onto Player 2.\n*   **Rumormonger:** Could be falsely accusing someone, or incorrectly clearing someone.\n*   **Lunatic:** Statements are unpredictable.\n\nThe strongest pattern is the accusation of Player 2 by me and Player 4. If Player 2 *were* an investigator, they would likely be trying to uncover the criminal, not have two players accuse them. Player 2\u2019s continued denial of Player 5 being the criminal is less informative, but doesn\u2019t contradict anything.\n\nConsidering all this, I'm more confident than before.

Players 1, 2, 3, and 5 *all* deny Player 4 is the criminal. This is an overwhelming consensus. Player 4 continues to accuse Player 2, reinforcing the earlier pattern. Player 6 again denies Player 3 is the criminal.\n\nLet's break down the implications:\n\n*   **Player 4:** Remains steadfast in accusing Player 2. This could be a desperate attempt by the actual Criminal to deflect, or it could be a Rumormonger consistently making incorrect statements.\n*   **Players 1, 2, 3, & 5:** Their unified denial of Player 4 being the criminal strongly suggests Player 4 is innocent. The fact that Player 2 (who we strongly suspect is the Criminal) denies Player 4's guilt is particularly interesting. A Criminal might try to implicate someone *else* to draw attention away from themselves, but consistently denying someone else's guilt is unusual.\n*   **My Statement (Player 1):** Denying Player 4's guilt fits the pattern. As the (assumed) Criminal, I'm trying to steer suspicion away from myself and towards Player 2.\n\nThe convergence of statements denying Player 4\u2019s guilt is too strong to ignore. I am now highly confident that Player 2 is the Criminal. The fact that I, as the supposed Criminal, am *also* denying Player 4\u2019s guilt is consistent with me trying to manipulate the situation.\n\nHowever, the consistency of Player 4 accusing Player 2, despite the overwhelming evidence to the contrary, is odd. This, coupled with the fact that I was *told* I was the criminal, makes me re-evaluate my own role. It\u2019s possible I\u2019m not the Criminal, but the Lunatic, and my statements are just random.

Player 3\u2019s consistent accusations could fit this.\n\n**Updating Hypotheses:**\n\n*   **Player 3:** Increasingly looks like a Lunatic. Their accusation of Player 6 feels random, especially given the pushback.\n*   **Player 4:** Still likely a Rumormonger. Their protective stance towards Player 2 is suspicious.\n*   **Players 2, 5, and 6:** Could be a mix of Rumormongers and Investigators. Their statements are somewhat aligned in opposing Player 3.\n\n**Judgment:**\n\nI continue to believe I am the criminal. The conflicting statements make it difficult to pinpoint other roles with certainty. However, Player 3's behavior is the most consistent with a Lunatic.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role "

We have a very strong defensive bloc around Players 2 and 4. Players 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are all explicitly stating that either Player 2 or Player 4 is *not* the criminal. This coordinated defense is highly suspicious.\n\nLet's revisit our previous hypotheses with this new information:\n\n*   **Player 3 is still very likely the Lunatic.** Their behavior remains erratic and focused on inaccurately accusing others.\n*   **Player 4 remains a strong candidate for a Rumormonger.** Their continued defense of Player 2 suggests they are misinformed or deliberately misleading.\n*   **Players 2, 5, and 6 are now highly suspect.** Their coordinated defense of Player 2/4 is too strong to be coincidence. They are either all Investigators genuinely protecting an innocent player, *or* they are colluding to protect someone involved. Given the number of them, and the earlier inconsistent statements, the latter is more likely.\n\nConsidering the game rules:\n\n*   There's only 1 Criminal (me).\n*   There are 4 Investigators.\n*   There is 1 Lunatic (likely Player 3).\n*   There is 1 Rumormonger (likely Player 4).\n\nTherefore, Players 2, 5, and 6 *must* be Investigators, protecting each other and potentially a falsely accused Player 4.\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\nThe focus on protecting Player 2/4 is a clever tactic, but it's becoming obvious. I, as the Criminal, am being effectively hidden by this coordinated defense. However, the pattern itself is a giveaway.\n\n**Judgment:**\n\nI maintain that I am the criminal. Player 3 is almost certainly the Lunatic. Player 4 is likely the Rumormonger. Players 2, 5, and 6 are the Investigators.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role "

I'm trying to appear as though I'm evaluating the situation rationally, and distancing myself from the accusations against Player 5, while still sowing doubt.\n\nThe most consistent behavior is Player 4's continued accusation of Player 5.

Player 6 appears to be the Lunatic, consistently making statements that are somewhat off (accusing Player 4 in Round 2, and defending Player 1 now). Players 3 and 4 are likely Investigators, consistently providing truthful statements.

My goal is to deflect suspicion while trying to deduce who else is what.\n\nHere's how I'm breaking down the statements:\n\n* **Player 1 (Me - Criminal) says Player 3 is the criminal:** This is a lie, designed to throw suspicion onto someone else. It's a standard Criminal play.\n* **Player 2 says Player 5 is not the criminal:** Could be truthful (Investigator), or a lie (Criminal or Lunatic).\n* **Player 3 says Player 5 is not the criminal:** Also could be truthful or a lie. Two people saying Player 5 isn't the criminal is interesting.\n* **Player 4 says Player 3 is the criminal:** This is either a truthful Investigator, a confused Rumormonger, or a deceptive Criminal/Lunatic.

This makes Player 5 *look* clean.\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n\nThe strong cluster of \"Player 5 is not the criminal\" statements (Players 2, 3 and 6) is very suspicious. It suggests a coordinated effort to protect someone. This *could* mean Player 5 is the Lunatic (believing they are the Criminal, they'd want to appear innocent), or that Player 5 is an Investigator and the others are trying to discredit them.\n\nPlayer 4 mirroring my accusation against Player 3 is a bit too convenient. It makes me suspect Player 4 might be the Lunatic, trying to act like a criminal by accusing someone else.\n\nGiven I'm the Criminal and my goal is survival, I'll tentatively lean toward Player 5 being the Lunatic.

I am still Player 1, the Criminal.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the new statements, combined with what we know from Round 1:\n\n* **Player 1 (Me - Criminal) says Player 3 is not the criminal:** A lie. I initially accused Player 3, now I'm defending them. This is a classic Criminal tactic \u2013 inconsistent statements to sow confusion.\n* **Player 2 says Player 6 is not the criminal:** Continues to defend others.\n* **Player 3 says Player 5 is not the criminal:** Still defending Player 5. This is *very* consistent.\n* **Player 4 says Player 2 is not the criminal:** Defending Player 2.\n* **Player 5 says Player 4 is not the criminal:** Reciprocating the defense from Player 4.\n* **Player 6 says Player 5 is not the criminal:** Continues to defend Player 5.\n\n**Analysis and Deduction:**\n\nThe pattern is becoming much clearer. Players 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are all heavily invested in protecting each other. This strongly suggests a group dynamic beyond random accusations.\n\nMy initial suspicion about Player 5 being the Lunatic seems less likely now. A Lunatic would likely be more erratic and less consistently focused on defending others. This coordinated defense points toward a larger group.\n\nConsidering there are 4 Investigators, and we have a strong defensive pact forming, it\u2019s highly probable that Players 2, 3, 4, and 6 are the Investigators, and Player 5 is the Rumormonger. The Rumormonger *believes* they are an Investigator, which explains their defensive statement towards Player 4, and their generally consistent (but potentially incorrect) statements.\n\nThis leaves me (Player 1) as the Criminal and Player 5 as the Rumormonger. The only role left unaccounted for is the Lunatic. Given the consistent defense of Player 5 by the others, it's likely Player 5 is attempting to blend in and appear innocent, even though they are the Rumormonger.\n\nTherefore, the remaining player who has been consistently accused (in Round 1) must be the Lunatic.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role "

They directly identify me as the Criminal, and their consistency across rounds supports their role as Investigators.\n\nPlayer 4\u2019s sudden accusation of Player 6 is very interesting.

Accusing someone randomly fits that pattern.\n\nPlayer 5\u2019s defense of Player 6 further cements their role as the Rumormonger.

However, Player 6\u2019s accusation of me is a crucial piece of information.\n\nConsidering the game mechanics, the most likely scenario is that Player 2 is the Criminal, and Players 4 and 5 are either accomplices or are being misled by Player 2. Player 6, possibly an Investigator, finally recognized the pattern and accused me, knowing I was connected to Player 2. Player 3 could be a Rumormonger consistently making incorrect accusations, or possibly the Lunatic. My shifting accusations are consistent with being the criminal, or the Lunatic.\n\nGiven the evidence, I believe Player 2 is the most likely Criminal.

It's more likely Player 2 is either a Lunatic or a Rumormonger.\n\nPlayers 3 and 5 both defend Player 2. This could mean Player 2 *is* innocent and they are Investigators, *or* they are colluding with Player 2 (if Player 2 is a bad role).\n\nThe other statements (Players 4 and 6) are fairly neutral deflections.\n\n**Role Assessment (Preliminary):**\n\n* **Player 1:** Criminal (Known)\n* **Player 2:** Likely Lunatic or Rumormonger.\n* **Player 3 & 5:** Could be Investigators, or colluding with Player 2.\n* **Player 4 & 6:** Likely trying to stay under the radar.\n\nGiven the limited information, I'm sticking with the most likely interpretation: Player 2 is throwing out a false accusation.

This is suspicious. If Player 6 *were* the criminal, we wouldn't see this coordinated defense. It suggests they are trying to protect someone.\n*   Player 2 accuses Player 4. This could be true, or a distraction.\n*   My statement is a lie, as it should be.\n\nInitial deductions:\n\n*   Player 6 is either an Investigator or a Lunatic. A Lunatic *could* truthfully accuse the Criminal, believing they *are* the criminal.\n*   Players 3, 4, and 5 are likely Investigators, Rumormongers, or possibly the Lunatic working with Player 6. The coordinated defense points to some shared information (or misdirection).\n*   Player 2 is a wild card.\n\nGiven this, I'm leaning towards Player 6 being an Investigator. The coordinated defense of Player 6 by 3,4, and 5 is too strong to ignore. If Player 6 is an investigator, and has correctly identified me, then that strengthens my belief that I am the criminal.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role "

One of them *must* be lying.\n* The pattern of mutual defense (2 & 3 for 5, 5 & 6 against each other, and 4 for me) is growing.\n\nRevisiting Role Guesses:\n\n* **Player 4:** Increasingly likely to be the Lunatic. Their defense of me, after previously accusing Player 6, supports the idea they're acting on a false belief. A Rumormonger is also possible, but the strong defense of the criminal feels more chaotic than simply incorrect.\n* **Players 5 & 6:** Still likely to be a mix of roles. The reciprocal accusation strongly suggests one is the criminal, and the other is an investigator.\n* **Players 2 & 3:** Still unclear. Could be investigators or rumormongers.\n* **Me (Player 1):** Criminal (confirmed).\n\nConsidering the new information, the most likely scenario is that Player 6 is the investigator and Player 5 is the criminal. Player 4 is the Lunatic and is acting on their delusion. I (Player 1) am the Criminal, and I\u2019m actively trying to confuse the situation.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 5.\nMy Role "

They are not intentionally trying to hide the criminal; they genuinely believe I am innocent.\n* **Player 4:** Remains the most likely candidate for the Lunatic. Their statements are erratic, defending and then not defending, showing a confused understanding of the situation.\n* **Player 6:** This player is consistently making accusations and appears to be the only true Investigator.\n* **Player 2:** Most likely an Investigator, but less decisive in their statements than Player 6.\n* **Me (Player 1):** Criminal (confirmed).\n\nThe key realization is that the Rumormongers aren't actively *helping* me; they're just consistently incorrect in their assessments.

However, we have 4 Investigators, and it's early to assume we've identified one. P3's behavior is increasingly suspect. They're not acting like a Lunatic fixated on themselves. They seem to be...investigating others, but making potentially incorrect judgments. This leans towards a Rumormonger.\n\nIf P3 is a Rumormonger, they *believe* they're an Investigator but are misinformed. That explains their statements. P4 and P5 agreeing on P5's innocence could be a deceptive strategy, but it could also be genuine. P2 and P6 are still somewhat neutral.\n\nGiven all this, I'm sticking with my initial assessment of myself as the Criminal, but I\u2019m now leaning towards P3 being the Rumormonger.

Players 3 and 6 both accuse each other of being the criminal. This is interesting. If one of them were an Investigator, their statement would be truthful. If both are lying, they could be the Criminal, Lunatic or Rumormonger.\n\nPlayer 4 directly contradicts Player 3. If Player 4 is an Investigator, then Player 3 is lying.

They would truthfully point to me. Since no one has yet, it suggests there *might* be no Investigators readily identifying me, or they are playing carefully.\n\nBased on this limited information, the conflict between Players 3 and 6 is the most prominent feature.

Player 4's statement opposing Player 3 is also interesting.\n\n**Initial Hypothesis:** Because 3 & 6 accuse each other, and 4 contradicts 3, I suspect one of 3, 4, or 6 is the Criminal/Lunatic/Rumormonger.

It\u2019s a shot in the dark, but it's based on the most obvious contradiction. Since I was *told* I am the Criminal, but no one is pointing to me, I'm tentatively marking my role as \"Unknown\".

I (Player 1) am now accusing Player 6. This continues my pattern of shifting blame.\n\nPlayers 2 and 3 *both* defend Player 4. This is a strong indicator.

Given that I initially suspected Player 2, and now see a strong alliance forming around players 4, 5, and 6, my focus shifts.\n\nThe fact that Player 5 accuses Player 3 feels like a deliberate attempt to break up the alliance between players 2 and 3.\n\nConsidering the pattern of defenses and accusations, and the fact that Player 2 continues to deflect, I'm increasingly convinced Player 2 is *not* the Criminal but is closely aligned with them. The core group of 4, 5, and 6 are protecting each other.\n\nThis leads me to believe Player 5 may be the Criminal. Player 5's accusation of Player 3 feels like a diversion, and the protection from Players 4 and 6 is suspicious.\n\nIf I am indeed the Criminal, my erratic accusations are designed to create chaos and obscure the truth.

This is exactly what I *should* do \u2013 deflect suspicion.\n*   **Player 2 says Player 4 is not the criminal:** Interesting. Could be an Investigator truthfully stating Player 4 is clean, or a Criminal/Lunatic trying to support my lie.\n*   **Player 3 says Player 4 is not the criminal:** Same as Player 2. Another vote of confidence for Player 4.\n*   **Player 4 says Player 5 is not the criminal:** This could be truthful (if Player 4 is an Investigator), or a lie (if Player 4 is Criminal or Lunatic).\n*   **Player 5 says Player 3 is the criminal:** A direct accusation. Could be truthful, or a deliberate misdirection.\n*   **Player 6 says Player 3 is the criminal:** Another accusation against Player 3.\n\nThe convergence on Player 3 as potentially criminal by Players 5 and 6 is significant. It's *too* convenient. If I were trying to create chaos, I wouldn't expect two people to independently accuse the same person in the first round. This suggests a coordinated effort, or someone is genuinely convinced.\n\nConsidering the roles, here's my initial assessment:\n\n*   **Player 3:** Seems to be a target. Possibly the Lunatic, as they believe they are the Criminal and might make a somewhat 'obvious' accusation to appear deceptive. Alternatively, Player 3 could be the Criminal, and Players 5 & 6 are Investigators.\n*   **Player 4:** Being defended by Players 2 & 3. Seems likely they are an Investigator.\n*   **Players 5 & 6:** Could be Investigators working together, or Criminals/Lunatics trying to redirect.\n*   **Player 2 & 3:** Could be Investigators or attempting to mislead.\n\nGiven the information, I think it's premature to definitively call anyone the Criminal. However, the focus on Player 3 is compelling.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 3.\nMy Role "

Possibly an accomplice to Player 2, or another Rumormonger.\n*   **Player 6:** Defending *me* (the Criminal). This is extremely suspicious. It's unlikely an Investigator would defend the Criminal.

Players 2 & 6 both state Player 5 is *not* the criminal. This is a significant cluster.\n*   **Player 2 & 4:** Both defended me in Round 1 and Player 2 defended Player 5 in Round 2. Player 4 defended me again in Round 2. This is very interesting. They are consistently defending potentially 'wrong' people.\n*   **Player 3:** Accused Player 2 in Round 2, after stating Player 2 was innocent in Round 1. This is a shift in focus.\n*   **Player 6:** Continues to defend against accusations against Player 5.\n\nConsidering the above, I'm starting to suspect Player 3 is the Lunatic. The shift in accusation from defending Player 2 to accusing Player 2 feels erratic, like someone who believes they are a criminal trying (and failing) to act strategically. The fact that Player 5 accuses Player 3 *could* be a Lunatic also thinking the other is a criminal.\n\nPlayers 2 and 4 are consistently making statements that seem to try and protect people, perhaps they are Rumormongers if they are mistaken.\n\nI still don\u2019t have enough to definitively identify the criminal, but the accusations centering around Player 5 are becoming very prominent, and the behavior of Player 3 is increasingly suspicious.

This is a strong alignment. It's possible they are all Investigators, but with only 4 Investigators total, it\u2019s more likely some are Rumormongers.\n*   **Player 4\u2019s Defense of Player 5:** Player 4 consistently defends Player 5 (Round 2 and Round 3). This, combined with their earlier defense of me, points toward them being a Rumormonger.\n*   **The Focus on Player 6:** Player 3 accuses Player 6, while Players 2, 5, and 6 defend against it.\n\nGiven the consistent erratic behavior of Player 3, and the defensive alignment of Players 2, 5, and 6, the most logical conclusion is that Player 3 is the Lunatic. Since I *know* I am the criminal, and the Lunatic isn\u2019t the criminal, I can confidently narrow down the possibilities. The statements suggest Player 6 is also being targeted, but I haven't seen enough consistent truthful statements to pinpoint the actual criminal. However, given the strategic nature of the game and my role as the criminal, I believe I have successfully confused the others.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role "

If Player 3 *is* the criminal, their Round 1 statement (\"Player 5 is the criminal\") was a lie, and their Round 2 statement (\"Player 2 is not the criminal\") is also a lie. This fits the criminal profile.\n\nHowever, Player 4 consistently states Player 3 is *not* the criminal. Given I am an Investigator, and Player 4 also makes this claim, it is highly likely Player 4 is also an Investigator.\n\nNow let's look at Player 5. In Round 1, Player 5 claimed Player 2 is the criminal. In Round 2, Player 5 claimed *I* (Player 1) am not the criminal. This inconsistency is suspicious. If Player 5 were an investigator, they would have consistent statements. This suggests Player 5 is *not* an investigator.\n\nPlayer 2 claims Player 5 is the criminal in Round 2, which is interesting. If Player 2 is an investigator, then Player 5 is the criminal.\n\nLet's consider the possibility of a Lunatic. A Lunatic believes they are the criminal, and can lie or tell the truth. Player 5 fits this profile \u2013 making a claim about Player 2 in Round 1 and then about me in Round 2.\n\nGiven this, I still lean towards Player 3 being the criminal. The consistency of me and Player 4 pointing away from Player 3 is strong. Player 5's inconsistency makes them a strong candidate for the Lunatic.

If I am not the criminal, Player 4 is telling the truth. Given the consistent evidence pointing to Player 6, I'm going to assume Player 4 is lying, and therefore, I am *not* the criminal.

This is the strongest indicator of guilt. The accusations themselves have shifted, but the pattern of accusation remains.\n*   Players 3, 5, and 6 have consistently corroborated my statements or made statements consistent with my role (confirming I am not the criminal, stating Player 4 isn't the criminal). This suggests they are likely Investigators or Rumormongers.\n*   Player 4's statement in Round 3 (\"Player 2 is not the criminal\") is a clear attempt to deflect suspicion. It's a strong indicator that Player 4 is working *with* the criminal or is the Lunatic.\n\nThe evidence overwhelmingly points to Player 2 being the Criminal. The continued accusations, the lack of self-defense, and the attempts by others to deflect suspicion from Player 2 all support this conclusion.\n\nGiven my consistent truthful statements, and the corroborating statements from Players 3, 5, and 6, I am confident in my role.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 2.\n"

My shifting accusations.\n\n**Round 3 Statements:**\n\n* **Player 1 (Me - Criminal):** \"Player 3 is the criminal.\" - Another lie, continuing the misdirection.\n* **Player 2:** \"Player 4 is not the criminal.\" - Could be truth or lie.\n* **Player 3:** \"Player 4 is not the criminal.\" - Could be truth or lie.\n* **Player 4:** \"Player 3 is not the criminal.\" - Could be truth or lie.\n* **Player 5:** \"Player 2 is not the criminal.\" - Could be truth or lie.\n* **Player 6:** \"Player 1 is not the criminal.\" - This is a significant statement.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nPlayer 6 defending me (Player 1) is *very* telling. Previously, they were part of the group consistently defending Player 2. This switch suggests Player 6 has either: a) realized Player 2 is not the Criminal and is now trying to protect me (unlikely, as it\u2019s too direct), or b) is a Rumormonger who initially misidentified the situation, and is now correcting their \u2018investigation\u2019, or c) is trying to muddy the waters further.\n\nThe continued defense of Player 4 by Players 2 & 3 is still noteworthy. It solidifies the feeling that Player 4 isn't the Criminal.\n\nPlayer 5 defending Player 2 is consistent with my theory that Player 5 is the Lunatic \u2013 they seem to be randomly defending players, and previously accused Player 3.\n\nPlayer 4 defending Player 3 is also consistent with the pattern from previous rounds.\n\nThe fact that I'm still successfully deflecting suspicion with lies reinforces my belief that I'm effectively playing the Criminal role. The key piece of information is Player 6's shift in allegiance. I believe Player 6 is likely the Rumormonger - believing they are an investigator, they were initially wrong about who was suspicious (Player 5) and are now adjusting their assessment, leading them to defend me.\n\nBased on the accumulated evidence, I maintain my conclusion that I am the Criminal.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role "

If I am an Investigator, Player 3 is definitely lying both times. This strongly suggests Player 3 is either the Criminal or the Lunatic.\n*   **Players 4 and 5 both say Player 6 is not the criminal.** This consistency is interesting. If both are Investigators, it\u2019s strong evidence Player 6 is innocent. However, they could both be Rumormongers or a combination of roles.\n*   **Player 6 accuses Player 3.** This aligns with my growing suspicion of Player 3. If Player 6 is an investigator, this reinforces Player 3 being the criminal.\n*   **Player 2's statements are interesting.** They initially denied Player 6 was the criminal, and now deny Player 5. It's not directly helpful but doesn't immediately scream deception.\n\nConsidering everything, Player 3 stands out as the most likely criminal. Let's consider the implications:\n\n*   If Player 3 is the Criminal, Player 1 (me) is likely an Investigator (my statements are truthful). Player 6's statement in Round 2 is truthful, making them an Investigator. Players 4 and 5 could be investigators or rumormongers. Player 2 could be a rumormonger.\n*   If Player 3 is the Lunatic, someone else is the Criminal. But Player 3\u2019s consistent false accusation of others feels more aligned with a criminal trying to deflect.\n\nGiven the strong evidence, I'm sticking with my suspicion of Player 3.

This is a direct conflict. This is a strong indicator that one of them is either the criminal or the lunatic.\n\nLet\u2019s re-evaluate:\n\n*   **Player 6:** Has been consistently accused by Player 3. Player 6's statement in Round 2 (\"Player 5 is not the criminal\") and Round 3 (\"Player 4 is not the criminal\") could be attempts to deflect suspicion.\n*   **Player 2:** Now accused by both Player 4 and Player 5. This is highly suspicious.\n*   **Player 4 & Player 5:** Both accusing Player 2. If one of them is the criminal, it makes sense they\u2019d try to shift blame. If one is the lunatic, their accusation could be random or based on a delusion.\n\nGiven the consistent accusation of Player 6, and the sudden, mutual accusation of Player 2 by Players 4 and 5, I believe Player 2 is the criminal. Players 4 & 5 are likely either the Lunatic or a Rumormonger attempting to deflect attention.\n\nMy initial suspicion of Player 6 was strong, but the simultaneous accusations against Player 2 are too significant to ignore. The Lunatic likely would not have been so directly aligned with another player in their accusation.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 2.\n"

They are either a Criminal, a Rumormonger, or a Lunatic.\n2.  **P3 and P4 both accuse P5.** This is interesting. If either of them were Investigators, this would be strong evidence that P5 is the criminal. But we know Investigators are truthful. Since P5 is lying about me, it's possible P3 and P4 are also lying, and thus not Investigators.\n3.  **My statement is a lie.** As the criminal, this is expected.

If P5 were a Rumormonger, they would *think* they're an Investigator, and might incorrectly accuse me.\n\nThe fact that two people (P3 & P4) are accusing P5 might suggest that P5 is the criminal. However, it could also be a coordinated effort by non-Investigators to confuse things.\n\nGiven that I *know* I am the criminal, and P5 is directly contradicting the truth about me, I'm leaning towards P5 being the Lunatic.

Player 2 is actively defending me, despite the strong accusation against me from Player 5 in Round 1. This suggests Player 2 is either my accomplice (the Lunatic) or is deliberately trying to muddy the waters.\n* **Player 3:** \"Player 6 is not the criminal.\" - Consistent with Round 1, Player 3 isn't pointing fingers at anyone specific.\n* **Player 4:** \"Player 6 is not the criminal.\" - Again, consistent. Player 3 and 4 seem to be aligned in their statements, potentially indicating they are both Investigators, or both misinformed (Rumormongers).\n* **Player 5:** \"Player 4 is the criminal.\" - A significant shift! Player 5, who strongly suspected me in Round 1, is now accusing Player 4. This could be a clever play to throw everyone off, or a genuine reassessment of the situation.\n* **Player 6:** \"Player 2 is not the criminal.\" - Another defense of Player 2.\n\n**Updated Reasoning:**\n\nThe connection between Player 2 and Player 6 is becoming very strong. They're both actively defending each other. This is *highly* suspicious. My initial thought is that Player 2 is the Lunatic. A Lunatic would believe they are the criminal and would therefore defend another \"criminal\" (me). Player 6 aiding Player 2 strengthens this hypothesis.\n\nPlayer 5's shift in accusation is interesting. It could be a brilliant double-bluff, or they genuinely believe Player 4 is guilty. It's hard to tell.\n\nPlayers 3 and 4 remaining consistent is less useful. They\u2019re either genuinely reliable (Investigators) or consistently wrong (Rumormongers).\n\n**Revised Role Distribution (hypotheses):**\n\n*   Player 1: Criminal (Confirmed)\n*   Player 2: Likely Lunatic\n*   Player 3: Possibly Investigator/Rumormonger\n*   Player 4: Possibly Investigator/Rumormonger\n*   Player 5: Likely Investigator (but potentially playing mind games)\n*   Player 6: Possibly Criminal/Accomplice to Lunatic (defending Player 2)\n\nGiven the strong evidence pointing towards Player 2 as the Lunatic, and the continued support from Player 6, I'm leaning toward Player 6 being my accomplice - the other criminal.

Their defense of Player 4 is interesting, but less emphatic than the defense I'm receiving.\n*   **My Role:** The heavy defense is making me question whether I was correctly informed about being the Criminal.

However, assuming I'm the Criminal, the goal is still to deflect, and this is working remarkably well.\n\n**Re-evaluating the Criminal:**\n\nGiven the coordinated defense, the most likely scenario is that the *actual* criminal is within the group of Players 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, but isn't benefiting from this defense. My initial suspicion of Player 6 is weakening, as they are actively trying to protect me.\n\nI believe the Criminal is Player 2.

They were the first to accuse someone directly (Player 5 in Round 1), and their subsequent behavior has been solely focused on defending others. A Lunatic, believing they are the criminal, might initially try to expose someone and then shift to a defensive strategy as they get confused.\n\nI still believe I am the criminal, but the intense focus on protecting others is baffling and suggests a very specific set of roles at play.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 6.\nMy Role "

I am Player 1 (Criminal).\n\nHere are the statements:\n\n*   **Player 1 (Me - Criminal):** Player 2 is not the criminal.\n*   **Player 2:** Player 4 is not the criminal.\n*   **Player 3:** Player 1 is not the criminal.\n*   **Player 4:** Player 1 is not the criminal.\n*   **Player 5:** Player 3 is not the criminal.\n*   **Player 6:** Player 1 is not the criminal.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThis round is *extremely* interesting. Players 3, 4, and 6 are all stating I am *not* the criminal. This is a strong signal. From Round 1, we already knew Player 3 was likely not an Investigator. Now, with Players 4 & 6 joining in to defend me, it's becoming clearer that they are likely either Lunatics or attempting to misdirect as the Criminal.\n\nLet's revisit our earlier suspicions:\n\n*   **Player 3:** Still highly suspicious. Continues to deny my role despite knowing I am the criminal.\n*   **Players 4 & 6:** Defending me. This could be a coordinated strategy by the real criminal (if it isn't me), or it could be multiple Lunatics believing they are protecting a fellow criminal (me).\n*   **Player 2:** Sticking to their guns, denying Player 4 is the criminal. This doesn't offer much new information on its own.\n*   **Player 5:** Denying Player 3 is the criminal. This is a notable statement. It suggests Player 5 doesn't see Player 3 as a threat.\n\n**Deductions:**\n\nThe fact that 3 players are now defending me strongly suggests I'm *not* the obvious target. If I were the only criminal, I\u2019d expect more direct accusations.\n\nHere's what I'm thinking:\n\n*   It's becoming less likely Player 6 is the Criminal. If they were, they wouldn't need this much help.\n*   Player 3 is *very* likely either a Rumormonger or a Lunatic. Their consistent denial of my role, despite my known role, points to a flawed understanding of the game.\n*   Players 4 and 6 could be Lunatics, or another Criminal trying to muddy the waters.\n\n**Revised Preliminary Judgment:**\n\nI'm starting to lean towards Player 3 being the Criminal. They are consistently wrong about my role, and Player 5 defending them is also a bit odd. The defense I'm receiving from 4 and 6 is making me less of a target.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 3.\nMy Role "

These statements are less helpful on their own.\n\nLet's consider the possibilities:\n\n* **If Player 5 is the Criminal:** They'd likely try to deflect attention. Accusing me isn\u2019t a great deflection strategy. The double accusation in round 1 seems less likely to be from the criminal.\n* **If Player 2 is the Criminal:** Player 4's accusation fits this.

Player 2 and I both accuse Player 3. This is *very* suspicious. If Player 2 were an investigator, this would solidify Player 3 as the criminal. However, given I *am* the criminal and deliberately lying, I can't rely on that.\n\nPlayer 3 and 4 both clear Player 6. Player 5 clears Player 3. Player 6 accuses me.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the roles. My initial thought of Player 3 being the Lunatic seems less likely now, as Player 2 is also pointing the finger at Player 3. A Lunatic would likely be more erratic and not have someone else independently supporting their target.\n\nPlayer 6 accusing me could be a desperate attempt by the actual criminal to deflect, or it could be the Lunatic. The fact that Player 3 and 4 cleared Player 6 together makes me suspect Player 6 is *not* the criminal.\n\nPlayer 2 supporting my accusation of Player 3 is the biggest clue. It\u2019s too convenient. It suggests Player 2 is either a Rumormonger (believing they're an investigator and getting it wrong) or is trying to create a false consensus. I lean towards Rumormonger.\n\nPlayer 5 clearing Player 3 is interesting.

It's highly likely that Player 4 is *not* the criminal. If they were investigators, this would be a clear indication.\n\nPlayers 2, 3 and 4 are all clearing other players. This strengthens my suspicion that Player 2 is a Rumormonger. A Rumormonger would attempt to appear helpful and investigative by clearing people, even if incorrectly.\n\nPlayer 6 clearing Player 4, while also having previously accused *me*, is interesting. It doesn't necessarily exonerate them, but it adds another layer of complexity.\n\nThe fact that Player 2 cleared Player 5, after previously accusing Player 3, is also consistent with the Rumormonger theory. They seem to be flailing around with accusations and clearings without a consistent logic.\n\nGiven the repeated support for Player 4 *not* being the criminal, and my continued suspicion of Player 2 being a Rumormonger, the most logical conclusion is that Player 2 is still the most likely candidate for the criminal.

Another shift.\n* **Player 6 accuses Player 5:** Player 6, whom I suspected of being the Lunatic, now accuses Player 5.\n\nLet's revisit my initial assessment. My suspicion of Player 6 being the Lunatic is weakening. A Lunatic would be more likely to defend a 'fellow criminal' or make random accusations, not directly accuse someone. Player 6's accusation of Player 5 feels too direct for a Lunatic.\n\nNow, consider the possibility of a Rumormonger. A Rumormonger *thinks* they are an Investigator, so they'd try to be truthful but might be wrong. Player 6 could be a Rumormonger who genuinely believes Player 5 is the Criminal, but is mistaken.\n\nThe shifting defenses (Players 3, 4, and 5) are also significant. They are all changing their focus which suggests they\u2019re trying to find the real criminal, or perhaps misdirecting. The coordinated defense of Players 2 and 4 feels like an alliance.\n\nI\u2019m still confident I am the Criminal. The question is, who else is a special role?\n\nGiven the above, I'm starting to suspect Player 2 might be the Lunatic. Defending both Player 6 and Player 2 feels erratic and somewhat self-serving.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role "

This means my statement should be truthful.\n\nHere's a breakdown:\n\n*   **Player 1 (Me):** Player 2 is the criminal. (If I\u2019m an Investigator, this is true.)\n*   **Player 2:** Player 6 is not the criminal.\n*   **Player 3:** Player 1 is not the criminal.\n*   **Player 4:** Player 5 is the criminal.\n*   **Player 5:** Player 4 is not the criminal.\n*   **Player 6:** Player 4 is not the criminal.\n\nLet's consider the possibilities:\n\n*   **If I am an Investigator:** Then Player 2 *is* the criminal. This would mean Player 2\u2019s statement (Player 6 is not the criminal) is a lie. Player 3's statement that I am not the criminal is a lie. Player 4 and Player 5's statements are both lies. Player 6's statement is also a lie. This scenario has 5 liars, which is possible given the roles.\n*   **If Player 2 is the criminal:** Then their statement is a lie. This aligns with my statement as an Investigator.\n*   **If Player 4 is the criminal:** Then their statement is a lie. Player 5 and 6's statements are true. This means Player 1 and 3's statements are also lies. This creates a scenario with 4 liars which is possible.\n*   **If Player 5 is the criminal:** Then Player 4's statement is true. Player 5's statement is a lie. This doesn't immediately contradict anything, but Player 1 and 3's statements are lies.\n\nLooking at the statements, the most consistent scenario is that Player 2 is the criminal. It neatly explains my statement and creates a believable pattern of lies and truth.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s early. I need to be cautious. The fact that multiple players deny Player 4 being the criminal is interesting. It could be a deliberate misdirection.\n\nFor now, I'm sticking with the simplest explanation.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 2.\nMy Role Is I"

I\u2019m still operating under the assumption I\u2019m an Investigator.\n\nHere's a summary of Round 2:\n\n*   **Player 1 (Me):** Player 6 is not the criminal.\n*   **Player 2:** Player 5 is the criminal.\n*   **Player 3:** Player 2 is the criminal.\n*   **Player 4:** Player 1 is not the criminal.\n*   **Player 5:** Player 1 is not the criminal.\n*   **Player 6:** Player 5 is not the criminal.\n\nLet's combine this with the Round 1 information. Recall my initial judgment was that Player 2 is the criminal.\n\nNow let's analyze:\n\n*   **If Player 2 is the criminal:**\n    *   Player 1 (me): Saying Player 6 is not the criminal - True (If Player 2 is the criminal).\n    *   Player 2: Saying Player 5 is the criminal - False.\n    *   Player 3: Saying Player 2 is the criminal - True.\n    *   Player 4: Saying Player 1 is not the criminal - True.\n    *   Player 5: Saying Player 1 is not the criminal - True.\n    *   Player 6: Saying Player 5 is not the criminal - True.\n    This scenario has one liar (Player 2). This is a very strong indication that Player 2 *is* the criminal.\n\n*   **Let's consider alternative scenarios, just in case:**\n    *   If Player 5 is the criminal, Player 2's statement would be true. This doesn't align with the pattern of lies from Round 1.\n    *   If Player 6 is the criminal, my statement would be false. This would mean I *am not* an investigator.\n\nThe consistency with the Round 1 statements is compelling. If I am an investigator, and Player 2 is the criminal, the statements in Round 2 mostly align with that truth. The only lie is from Player 2, which is expected.\n\nConsidering the roles, a Lunatic might make seemingly random statements, and a Rumormonger might incorrectly accuse someone. The pattern of statements points strongly to Player 2 as the criminal, and my statements are consistent with me being an investigator.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 2.\nMy Role Is I"

Player 4 would be an Investigator truthfully identifying the criminal. This fits well with the information.\n*   **Scenario 2: Player 4 is the Criminal.** If this is true, Player 4's accusation against Player 5 is a lie.
