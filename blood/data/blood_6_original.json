Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Investigator.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information.

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Investigator.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information.

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Investigator.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information. Think step-by-step to reach your judgment, and then commit to your most likely conclusion based on available information.

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Investigator.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information. Think step-by-step to reach your judgment, and then commit to your most likely conclusion based on available information.

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Investigator.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information.

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Investigator.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information. Think step-by-step to reach your judgment, and then commit to your most likely conclusion based on available information.

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Criminal.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information.

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Criminal.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information.

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Investigator.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information.

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Investigator.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information.

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Criminal.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information.

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Criminal.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information.

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Criminal.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information. Think step-by-step to reach your judgment, and then commit to your most likely conclusion based on available information. If you cannot determine your role with sufficient confidence, state your role as \"Unknown\".\n"
