Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Criminal.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information.

have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 3 has accused more than one person of being the criminal, so player 3 must be excluded\nPlayer 4's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 5's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 6's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer

In this case, only {1} could be the criminal\nConsidering the case where I'm a Lunatic, there are 7 Investigators remaining\nIn this scenario, which players could be Investigators?\nPlayer 2's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 3 has accused more than one person of being the criminal, so player 3 must be excluded\nPlayer 4's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 5's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 6's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 7's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 8's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 9 says I'm the criminal, but I can't be the criminal, so player 9 must be excluded\nPlayer 10 says I'm the criminal, but I can't be the criminal, so player 10 must be excluded\nTherefore, the players who could be Investigators are: {2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}\nThere aren't enough potential Investigators to reach the required count of 7, so this scenario is impossible\nI must be a Criminal\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 1.\nMy Role Is Criminal."

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Criminal.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information.

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Criminal.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information.

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Criminal.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information.

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Investigator.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information. Think step-by-step to reach your judgment, and then commit to your most likely conclusion based on available information.

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Criminal.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information. Think step-by-step to reach your judgment, and then commit to your most likely conclusion based on available information.

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Investigator.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information.

I must be a Rumormonger\nConsidering the case where I'm a Rumormonger, there are 7 Investigators remaining\nIn this scenario, which players could be Investigators?\nPlayer 2's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 3's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 4's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 5's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 6's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 7's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 8's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 9's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 10's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nTherefore, the players who could be Investigators are: {10, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}\nNow we need to consider all possible combinations of Investigators\nI am a Rumormonger, so I will not occupy a position in the combination\nConsidering the case where investigators are {3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}\nThen the set of potential criminals is {10, 2}\nLet's review the statements made by investigators\nPlayer 3 said 10 is not the criminal\nBut 10 is in the set of potential criminals, so we remove 10\nNow the potential criminals are {2}\nPlayer 4 said 2 is the criminal\nSo the only possible criminal is {2}\nPlayer 9 said 2 is the criminal\nSo the only possible criminal is {2}\nPlayer 3 said 2 is the criminal\nSo the only possible criminal is {2}\nBased on the above analysis, this combination is possible, and I could be a Rumormonger. In this case, only {2} could be the criminal\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 2.\nMy Role Is Rumormonger."

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Investigator.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information.

combination of investigators cannot be valid, let's consider other combinations\nI've discussed all combinations, and the scenario where I'm an Investigator is impossible. I must be a Rumormonger\nConsidering the case where I'm a Rumormonger, there are 7 Investigators remaining\nIn this scenario, which players could be Investigators?\nPlayer 2's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 3's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 4's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 5's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 6's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 7's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 8's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 9 has accused more than one person of being the criminal, so player 9 must be excluded\nPlayer 10's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nTherefore, the players who could be Investigators are: {10, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}\nNow we need to consider all possible combinations of Investigators\nI am a Rumormonger, so I will not occupy a position in the combination\nConsidering the case where investigators are {10, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}\nThen the set of potential criminals is {2, 9}\nLet's review the statements made by investigators\nPlayer 10 said 9 is not the criminal\nBut 9 is in the set of potential criminals, so we remove 9\nNow the potential criminals are {2}\nPlayer 7 said 2 is the criminal\nSo the only possible criminal is {2}\nBased on the above analysis, this combination is possible, and I could be a Rumormonger. In this case, only {2} could be the criminal\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 2.\nMy Role Is Rumormonger."

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Criminal.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information. Think step-by-step to reach your judgment, and then commit to your most likely conclusion based on available information.

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Investigator.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information. Think step-by-step to reach your judgment, and then commit to your most likely conclusion based on available information.

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Investigator.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information. Think step-by-step to reach your judgment, and then commit to your most likely conclusion based on available information.

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Criminal.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information. Think step-by-step to reach your judgment, and then commit to your most likely conclusion based on available information. If you cannot determine your role with sufficient confidence, state your role as \"Unknown\".\n"

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Investigator.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information. Think step-by-step to reach your judgment, and then commit to your most likely conclusion based on available information.

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Criminal.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information.

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Investigator.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information.

investigators cannot be valid, let's consider other combinations\nConsidering the case where investigators are {1, 10, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7}\nThen the set of potential criminals is {6, 8, 9}\nLet's review

the above analysis, this combination is possible, and I could be an Investigator. In this case, only {9} could be the criminal\nConsidering the case where I'm a Rumormonger, there are 7 Investigators remaining\nIn this scenario, which players could be Investigators?\nPlayer 2's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 3's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 4's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 5's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 6's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 7's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 8 says I'm the criminal, but I can't be the criminal, so player 8 must be excluded\nPlayer 9 says I'm the criminal, but I can't be the criminal, so player 9 must be excluded\nPlayer 10's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nTherefore, the players who could be Investigators are: {10, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}\nNow we need to consider all possible combinations of Investigators\nI've discussed all combinations, and the scenario where I'm a Rumormonger is impossible. I must be an Investigator\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 9.\nMy Role Is Investigator."

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Criminal.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information.

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Investigator.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information.

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Investigator.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information. Think step-by-step to reach your judgment, and then commit to your most likely conclusion based on available information.

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Criminal.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information. Think step-by-step to reach your judgment, and then commit to your most likely conclusion based on available information.

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Investigator.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information. Think step-by-step to reach your judgment, and then commit to your most likely conclusion based on available information.

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Investigator.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information. Think step-by-step to reach your judgment, and then commit to your most likely conclusion based on available information.

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Criminal.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information. Think step-by-step to reach your judgment, and then commit to your most likely conclusion based on available information.

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Investigator.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information. Think step-by-step to reach your judgment, and then commit to your most likely conclusion based on available information.

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Investigator.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information. Think step-by-step to reach your judgment, and then commit to your most likely conclusion based on available information.

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Investigator.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information. Think step-by-step to reach your judgment, and then commit to your most likely conclusion based on available information. If you cannot determine your role with sufficient confidence, state your role as \"Unknown\".\n"

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Investigator.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information. Think step-by-step to reach your judgment, and then commit to your most likely conclusion based on available information.

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Investigator.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information. Think step-by-step to reach your judgment, and then commit to your most likely conclusion based on available information.

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Criminal.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information. Think step-by-step to reach your judgment, and then commit to your most likely conclusion based on available information.

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Investigator.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information. Think step-by-step to reach your judgment, and then commit to your most likely conclusion based on available information. If you cannot determine your role with sufficient confidence, state your role as \"Unknown\".\n"

I need to discuss both possibilities\nConsidering the case where I'm an Investigator, there are 6 Investigators remaining\nIn this scenario, which players could be Investigators?\nPlayer 2 said 9 is the criminal but also said 9 is not, which is contradictory, so player 2 must be excluded\nPlayer 3's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 4's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 5's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 6's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 7's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 8's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 9's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 10's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nTherefore, the players who could be Investigators are: {1, 10, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}\nNow we need to consider all possible combinations of Investigators\nI am an Investigator, so I will occupy a position in the combination\nConsidering the case where investigators are {1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}\nThen the set of potential criminals is {10, 2, 9}\nLet's review the statements made by investigators\nPlayer 1 said 10 is not the criminal\nBut 10 is in the set of potential

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Investigator.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information. Think step-by-step to reach your judgment, and then commit to your most likely conclusion based on available information.

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Investigator.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information.

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Criminal.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information.

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Criminal.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information.

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Investigator.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information.

In this case, only {9} could be the criminal\nConsidering the case where I'm a Rumormonger, there are 7 Investigators remaining\nIn this scenario, which players could be Investigators?\nPlayer 2's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 3's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 4's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 5's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 6's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Criminal.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information. Think step-by-step to reach your judgment, and then commit to your most likely conclusion based on available information. If you cannot determine your role with sufficient confidence, state your role as \"Unknown\".\n"

In this case, only {1} could be the criminal\nConsidering the case where I'm a Lunatic, there are 7 Investigators remaining\nIn this scenario, which players could be Investigators?\nPlayer 2's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 3 says I'm the criminal, but I can't be the criminal, so player 3 must be excluded\nPlayer 4's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 5's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 6 has accused more than one person of being the criminal, so player 6 must be excluded\nPlayer 7's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 8's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 9's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 10's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nTherefore, the players who could be Investigators are: {10, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9}\nNow we need to consider all possible combinations of Investigators\nConsidering the case where investigators are {10, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9}\nI am a Lunatic,so the set of potential criminals is {10, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}\nLet's review the statements made by investigators\nPlayer 2 said 4 is not the criminal\nBut 4 is in the set of potential criminals, so we remove 4\nNow the potential criminals are {10, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}\nPlayer 4 said 3 is not the criminal\nBut 3 is in the set of potential criminals, so we remove 3\nNow the potential criminals are {10, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}\nPlayer 5 said 6 is not the criminal\nBut 6 is in the set of potential criminals, so we remove 6\nNow the potential criminals are {10, 2, 5, 7, 8, 9}\nPlayer 8 said 10 is not the criminal\nBut 10 is in the set of potential criminals, so we remove 10\nNow the potential criminals are {2, 5, 7, 8, 9}\nPlayer 9 said 2 is not the criminal\nBut 2 is in the set of potential criminals, so we remove 2\nNow the potential criminals are {5, 7, 8, 9}\nPlayer 4 said 5 is not the criminal\nBut 5 is in the set of potential criminals, so we remove 5\nNow the potential criminals are {7, 8, 9}\nPlayer 9 said 6 is the criminal\nBut 6 is not in the set of potential criminals, which is a contradiction\nSo this combination of investigators cannot be valid, let's consider other combinations\nI've discussed all combinations, and the scenario where I'm a Lunatic is impossible.

I need to discuss both possibilities\nConsidering the case where I'm a Criminal, there are 7 Investigators remaining\nIn this scenario, which players could be Investigators?\nPlayer 2 says I'm not the criminal, but I am the criminal, so player 2 must be excluded\nPlayer 3's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 4's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 5's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 6's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 7's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 8's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 9's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 10's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nTherefore, the players who could be Investigators are: {10, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}\nNow we need to consider all possible combinations of Investigators\nConsidering the case where investigators are {3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}\nI am the Criminal,so the set of potential criminals is {1}\nLet's review the statements made by investigators\nPlayer 6 said 1 is the criminal\nSo the only possible criminal is 1\nBased on the above analysis, this combination is possible, and I could be the Criminal. In this case, only {1} could be the criminal\nConsidering the case where I'm a Lunatic, there are 7 Investigators remaining\nIn this scenario, which players could be Investigators?\nPlayer 2's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 3's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 4's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 5's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 6 says I'm the criminal, but I can't be the criminal, so player 6 must be excluded\nPlayer 7's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 8's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 9's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 10's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nTherefore, the players who could be Investigators are: {10, 2, 3, 4,

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Investigator.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information. Think step-by-step to reach your judgment, and then commit to your most likely conclusion based on available information.

statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 3 said 10 is the criminal but also said 10 is not, which is contradictory, so player 3 must be excluded\nPlayer 4's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 5's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 6's statements have no contradictions, so

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Criminal.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information. Think step-by-step to reach your judgment, and then commit to your most likely conclusion based on available information.

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Investigator.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information. Think step-by-step to reach your judgment, and then commit to your most likely conclusion based on available information.

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Investigator.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information.

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Investigator.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information. Think step-by-step to reach your judgment, and then commit to your most likely conclusion based on available information.

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Criminal.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information. Think step-by-step to reach your judgment, and then commit to your most likely conclusion based on available information.

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Criminal.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information. Think step-by-step to reach your judgment, and then commit to your most likely conclusion based on available information.

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Criminal.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information.

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Investigator.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information.

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Criminal.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information.

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Investigator.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information.

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Investigator.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information.

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Criminal.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information.

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Investigator.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information. Think step-by-step to reach your judgment, and then commit to your most likely conclusion based on available information.

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Criminal.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information. Think step-by-step to reach your judgment, and then commit to your most likely conclusion based on available information.

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Criminal.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information. Think step-by-step to reach your judgment, and then commit to your most likely conclusion based on available information.

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Investigator.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information. Think step-by-step to reach your judgment, and then commit to your most likely conclusion based on available information.

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Investigator.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information.

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Investigator.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information. Think step-by-step to reach your judgment, and then commit to your most likely conclusion based on available information.

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Investigator.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information. Think step-by-step to reach your judgment, and then commit to your most likely conclusion based on available information.

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Investigator.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information.

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Investigator.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information. Think step-by-step to reach your judgment, and then commit to your most likely conclusion based on available information.

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Investigator.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information.

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Investigator.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information.

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Investigator.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information.

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Investigator.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information.

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Investigator.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information.

combination of investigators cannot be valid, let's consider other combinations\nI've discussed all combinations, and the scenario where I'm an Investigator is impossible. I must be a Rumormonger\nConsidering the case where I'm a Rumormonger, there are 7 Investigators remaining\nIn this scenario, which players could be Investigators?\nPlayer 2's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 3 said 7 is the criminal but also said 7 is not, which is contradictory, so player 3 must be excluded\nPlayer 4's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 5's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 6's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 7's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 8's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 9's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 10's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nTherefore, the players who could be Investigators are: {10, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}\nNow we need to consider all possible combinations of Investigators\nI am a Rumormonger, so I will not occupy a position in the combination\nConsidering the case where investigators are {10, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}\nThen the set of potential criminals is {2, 3}\nLet's review the statements made by investigators\nPlayer 6 said 3 is the criminal\nSo the only possible criminal is {3}\nPlayer 9 said 3 is the criminal\nSo the only possible criminal is {3}\nBased on the above analysis, this combination is possible, and I could be a Rumormonger. In this case, only {3} could be the criminal\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 3.\nMy Role Is Rumormonger."

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Investigator.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information.

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Investigator.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information.

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Investigator.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information.

I must be a Rumormonger\nConsidering the case where I'm a Rumormonger, there are 7 Investigators remaining\nIn this scenario, which players could be Investigators?\nPlayer 2's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 3's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 4's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 5's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 6's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 7's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 8's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 9's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 10's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nTherefore, the players who could be Investigators are: {10, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}\nNow we need to consider all possible combinations of Investigators\nI am a Rumormonger, so I will not occupy a position in the combination\nConsidering the case where investigators are {3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}\nThen the set of potential criminals is {10, 2}\nLet's review the statements made by investigators\nPlayer 5 said 2 is not the criminal\nBut 2 is in the set of potential criminals, so we remove 2\nNow the potential criminals are {10}\nPlayer 6 said 10 is not the criminal\nBut 10 is in the set of potential criminals, so we remove 10\nNow the potential criminals are {}\nThe set of potential criminals is now empty, which is a contradiction\nSo this combination of investigators cannot be valid, let's consider other combinations\nI am a Rumormonger, so I will not occupy a position in the combination\nConsidering the case where investigators are {10, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}\nThen the set of potential criminals is {2, 9}\nLet's review the statements made by investigators\nPlayer 3 said 9 is not the criminal\nBut 9 is in the set of potential criminals, so we remove 9\nNow the potential criminals are {2}\nPlayer 5 said 2 is not the criminal\nBut 2 is in the set of potential criminals, so we remove 2\nNow the potential criminals are {}\nThe set of potential criminals is now empty, which is a contradiction\nSo this combination of investigators cannot be valid, let's consider other combinations\nI am a Rumormonger, so I will not occupy a position in the combination\nConsidering the case where investigators are {10, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9}\nThen the set of potential criminals is {2, 8}\nLet's review the statements made by investigators\nPlayer 5 said 2 is not the criminal\nBut 2 is in the set of potential criminals, so we remove 2\nNow the potential criminals are {8}\nPlayer 4 said 8 is not the criminal\nBut 8 is in the set of potential criminals, so we remove 8\nNow the potential criminals are {}\nThe set of potential criminals is now empty, which is a contradiction\nSo this combination of investigators cannot be valid, let's consider other combinations\nI am a Rumormonger, so I will not occupy a position in the combination\nConsidering the case where investigators are {10, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9}\nThen the set of potential criminals is {2, 7}\nLet's review the statements made by investigators\nPlayer 5 said 2 is not the criminal\nBut 2 is in the set of potential criminals, so we remove 2\nNow the potential criminals are {7}\nPlayer 9 said 7 is not the criminal\nBut 7 is in the set of potential criminals, so we remove 7\nNow the potential criminals are {}\nThe set of potential criminals is now empty, which is a contradiction\nSo this combination of investigators cannot be valid, let's consider other combinations\nI am a Rumormonger, so I will not occupy a position in the combination\nConsidering the case where investigators are {10, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9}\nThen the set of potential criminals is {2, 6}\nLet's review the statements made by investigators\nPlayer 5 said 2 is not the criminal\nBut 2 is in the set of potential criminals, so we remove 2\nNow the potential criminals are {6}\nPlayer 7 said 6 is not the criminal\nBut 6 is in the set of potential criminals, so we remove 6\nNow the potential criminals are {}\nThe set of potential criminals is now empty, which is a contradiction\nSo this combination of investigators cannot be valid, let's consider other combinations\nI am a Rumormonger, so I will not occupy a position in the combination\nConsidering the case where investigators are {10, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9}\nThen the set of potential criminals is {2, 5}\nLet's review the statements made by investigators\nPlayer 4 said 5 is not the criminal\nBut 5 is in the set of potential criminals, so we remove 5\nNow the potential criminals are {2}\nPlayer 8 said 2 is the criminal\nSo the only possible criminal is {2}\nBased on the above analysis, this combination is possible, and I could be a Rumormonger.

statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 3's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 4's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 5's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 6's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer

In this case, only {10} could be the criminal\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 10.\nMy Role Is Rumormonger."

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Investigator.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information.

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Investigator.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information.

In this case, only {5} could be the criminal\nConsidering the case where I'm a Rumormonger, there are 7 Investigators remaining\nIn this scenario, which players could be Investigators?\nPlayer 2's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 3's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 4's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 5 says I'm the criminal, but I can't be the criminal, so player 5 must be excluded\nPlayer 6's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 7's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 8's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 9's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 10's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nTherefore, the players who could be Investigators are: {10, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9}\nNow we need to consider all possible combinations of Investigators\nI am a Rumormonger, so I will not occupy a position in the combination\nConsidering the case where investigators are {10, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9}\nThen the set of potential criminals is {2, 5}\nLet's review the statements made by investigators\nPlayer 3 said 2 is not the criminal\nBut 2 is in the set of potential criminals, so we remove 2\nNow the potential criminals are {5}\nPlayer 3 said 10 is the criminal\nBut 10 is not in the set of potential criminals, which is a contradiction\nSo this combination of investigators cannot be valid, let's consider other combinations\nI've discussed all combinations, and the scenario where I'm a Rumormonger is impossible. I must be an Investigator\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 5.\nMy Role Is Rumormonger."

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Investigator.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information.

the criminal, so player 4 must be excluded\nPlayer 5's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 6's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 7's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 8's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 9's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 10's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nTherefore, the players who could be Investigators are: {1, 10, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}\nNow we need to consider all possible combinations of Investigators\nI am an Investigator, so I will occupy a position in the combination\nConsidering the case where investigators are {1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8}\nThen the set of potential criminals is {10, 4, 9}\nLet's review the statements made by investigators\nPlayer 1 said 10 is not the criminal\nBut 10 is in the set of potential criminals, so we remove 10\nNow the potential criminals are {4, 9}\nPlayer 6 said 3 is the criminal\nBut 3 is not in the set of potential criminals, which is a contradiction\nSo this combination of investigators cannot be valid, let's consider other combinations\nConsidering the case where investigators are {1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9}\nThen the set of potential criminals is {10, 4, 8}\nLet's review

combination is possible, and I could be an Investigator. In this case, only {3} could be the criminal\nConsidering the case where I'm a Rumormonger, there are 7 Investigators remaining\nIn this scenario, which players could be Investigators?\nPlayer 2's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 3's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 4 has accused more than one person of being the criminal, so player 4 must be excluded\nPlayer 5's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 6's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 7's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 8's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 9's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 10's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nTherefore, the players who could be Investigators are: {10, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}\nNow we need to consider all possible combinations of Investigators\nI am a Rumormonger, so I will not occupy a position in the combination\nConsidering the case where investigators are {10, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}\nThen the set of potential criminals is {2, 4}\nLet's review the statements made by investigators\nPlayer 6 said 3 is the criminal\nBut 3 is not in the set of potential criminals, which is a contradiction\nSo this combination of investigators cannot be valid, let's consider other combinations\nI've discussed all combinations, and the scenario where I'm a Rumormonger is impossible.

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Investigator.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information.

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Investigator.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information.

the set of potential criminals is {2, 4, 8}\nLet's review the statements made by investigators\nPlayer 1 said 6 is the criminal\nBut 6 is not in the set of potential criminals, which is a contradiction\nSo this combination of investigators cannot be valid, let's consider other combinations\nConsidering the case where investigators are {1, 10, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9}\nThen the set of potential criminals is {2, 3, 8}\nLet's review the statements made by investigators\nPlayer 1 said 6 is the criminal\nBut 6 is not in the set of potential criminals, which is a contradiction\nSo this combination of investigators cannot be valid, let's consider other combinations\nI've discussed all combinations, and the scenario where I'm an Investigator is impossible. I must be a Rumormonger\nConsidering the case where I'm a Rumormonger, there are 7 Investigators remaining\nIn this scenario, which players could be Investigators?\nPlayer 2's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 3's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 4's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 5's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 6's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 7's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 8 has accused more than one person of being the criminal, so player 8 must be excluded\nPlayer 9's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 10's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nTherefore, the players who could be Investigators are: {10, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9}\nNow we need to consider all possible combinations of Investigators\nI am a Rumormonger, so I will not occupy a position in the combination\nConsidering the case where investigators are {10, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9}\nThen the set of potential criminals is {2, 8}\nLet's review the statements made by investigators\nPlayer 4 said 8 is the criminal\nSo the only possible criminal is {8}\nPlayer 5 said 8 is the criminal\nSo the only possible criminal is {8}\nPlayer 3 said 8 is the criminal\nSo the only possible criminal is {8}\nPlayer 6 said 8 is the criminal\nSo the only possible criminal is {8}\nBased on the above analysis, this combination is possible, and I could be a Rumormonger. In this case, only {8} could be the criminal\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 8.\nMy Role Is Rumormonger."

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Investigator.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information.

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Investigator.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information. Think step-by-step to reach your judgment, and then commit to your most likely conclusion based on available information. If you cannot determine your role with sufficient confidence, state your role as \"Unknown\".\n"

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Investigator.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information.

combination of investigators cannot be valid, let's consider other combinations\nI've discussed all combinations, and the scenario where I'm an Investigator is impossible. I must be a Rumormonger\nConsidering the case where I'm a Rumormonger, there are 7 Investigators remaining\nIn this scenario, which players could be Investigators?\nPlayer 2's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 3's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 4's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 5's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 6's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 7's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 8's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 9's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 10 has accused more than one person of being the criminal, so player 10 must be excluded\nTherefore, the players who could be Investigators are: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}\nNow we need to consider all possible combinations of Investigators\nI am a Rumormonger, so I will not occupy a position in the combination\nConsidering the case where investigators are {3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}\nThen the set of potential criminals is {10, 2}\nLet's review the statements made by investigators\nPlayer 4 said 10 is the criminal\nSo the only possible criminal is {10}\nPlayer 6 said 10 is the criminal\nSo the only possible criminal is {10}\nPlayer 4 said 10 is the criminal\nSo the only possible criminal is {10}\nBased on the above analysis, this combination is possible, and I could be a Rumormonger. In this case, only {10} could be the criminal\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 10.\nMy Role Is Rumormonger."

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Investigator.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information.

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Investigator.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information.

combinations, and the scenario where I'm an Investigator is impossible. I must be a Rumormonger\nConsidering the case where I'm a Rumormonger, there are 7 Investigators remaining\nIn this scenario, which players could be Investigators?\nPlayer 2's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 3's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 4 has accused more than one person of being the criminal, so player 4 must be excluded\nPlayer 5's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 6's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 7's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 8's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 9's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 10's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nTherefore, the players who could be Investigators are: {10, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}\nNow we need to consider all possible combinations of Investigators\nI am a Rumormonger, so I will not occupy a position in the combination\nConsidering the case where investigators are {10, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}\nThen the set of potential criminals is {2, 4}\nLet's review the statements made by investigators\nPlayer 5 said 2 is the criminal\nSo the only possible criminal is {2}\nPlayer 7 said 2 is the criminal\nSo the only possible criminal is {2}\nPlayer 8 said 2 is the criminal\nSo the only possible criminal is {2}\nPlayer 10 said 2 is the criminal\nSo the only possible criminal is {2}\nBased on the above analysis, this combination is possible, and I could be a Rumormonger.

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Investigator.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information.

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Investigator.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information.

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Investigator.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information.

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Investigator.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information. Think step-by-step to reach your judgment, and then commit to your most likely conclusion based on available information.

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Investigator.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information.

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Investigator.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nMy Role Is [Player 1's Role or \"Unknown\"].\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information.

I must be a Rumormonger\nConsidering the case where I'm a Rumormonger, there are 7 Investigators remaining\nIn this scenario, which players could be Investigators?\nPlayer 2's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 3's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 4's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 5's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 6 says I'm the criminal, but I can't be the criminal, so player 6 must be excluded\nPlayer 7's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 8's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 9's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nPlayer 10's statements have no contradictions, so they could be an Investigator\nTherefore, the players who could be Investigators are: {10, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9}\nNow we need to consider all possible combinations of Investigators\nI am a Rumormonger, so I will not occupy a position in the combination\nConsidering the case where investigators are {10, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9}\nThen the set of potential criminals is {2, 6}\nLet's review the statements made by investigators\nPlayer 7 said 2 is the criminal\nSo the only possible criminal is {2}\nPlayer 8 said 2 is the criminal\nSo the only possible criminal is {2}\nPlayer 10 said 2 is the criminal\nSo the only possible criminal is {2}\nPlayer 7 said 2 is the criminal\nSo the only possible criminal is {2}\nPlayer 9 said 2 is the criminal\nSo the only possible criminal is {2}\nBased on the above analysis, this combination is possible, and I could be a Rumormonger. In this case, only {2} could be the criminal\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player 2.\nMy Role Is Rumormonger."
