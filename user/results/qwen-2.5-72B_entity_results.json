This group is typically in the middle of their careers, has more disposable income, and is likely to have families, which aligns with the mentions of family vacations and staycations. They also have the experience and stability to travel for work regularly.\n- **Gender**: The reviews do not provide clear gender indicators, and the language and concerns are gender-neutral. Therefore, the most appropriate classification is Non-binary, as it encompasses a broader range of gender identities."
