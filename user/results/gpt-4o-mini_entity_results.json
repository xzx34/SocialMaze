However, the language and enthusiasm in other reviews suggest a younger audience as well. Phrases like \"game changer,\" \"obsessed,\" and \"sick ride\" are more commonly used by younger individuals, particularly in the 18-34 age range. The combination of these factors suggests a mixed demographic, but the presence of the older user indicates that there is a significant portion of users who are 55+.\n\n2. **Gender**: \n   - The reviews include both male and female perspectives. The use of \"man\" in some reviews suggests a male demographic, while the use of emojis and phrases like \"highly recommend it for anyone\" in another review indicates a female perspective. However, the overall tone and language used in the majority of the reviews lean slightly more towards a male demographic, especially with the casual and enthusiastic expressions.\n\nConsidering these observations, the primary demographic group appears to be a mix of younger adults and older adults, with a slight lean towards male users based on the language used.\n\nFinal demographic classification:\nAge Group: 55+\nGender: Male"

However, the use of \"man\" at the beginning of some reviews may indicate a male presence, but it is not definitive. Given the context of gaming and the character of Aloy, who is a strong female lead, it is likely that there is a significant female presence among the reviewers as well.\n\nConsidering these points, the primary demographic group appears to be younger individuals who are likely to be both male and female, but with a strong inclination towards the female demographic due to the emphasis on character relatability and strength.\n\nFinal demographic classification:\nAge Group: 18-34\nGender: Non-binary (to encompass both male and female reviewers)"
