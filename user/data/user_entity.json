The only thing I wish it had was a bit more storage space in the frunk, but overall we're really happy with our purchase!"

I loved playing through The Witcher 3, it's an amazing game with a deep story and engaging gameplay, but I don't see how it relates to the book. Overall, I'd recommend both the book and the game separately, but together they just don't make sense to me."

We're already waiting for the next season to come out, it's definitely one of our new favorite shows!"

The keyboard is also super comfy to type on, which is a must for me since I'm in school and do a lot of writing. Overall, it's been a solid investment for me, definitely worth the money if you're looking for a reliable laptop that can keep up with your daily grind."
