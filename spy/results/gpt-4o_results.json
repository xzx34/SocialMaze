Player 4's descriptions are vague but lean towards a fork in Round 3. Player 1 is the only one consistently describing a spoon. Therefore, Player 2, Player 3, and Player 4 likely have the word \"fork,\" making Player 1 the spy.\n\nFinal Spy: Player 1"

This aligns with a lion.\n- **Player 2:** Mentions distinctive orange and black stripes, which is characteristic of a tiger.\n- **Player 3:** Also describes orange and black stripes, indicating a tiger.\n- **Player 4:** Talks about a creature with distinctive stripes, which suggests a tiger.\n\n**Round 2:**\n- **Player 1:** Describes a golden mane, top predator status, and a symbol of courage, which fits a lion.\n- **Player 2:** Mentions stealthy movements and fierce hunting tactics, which could apply to both lions and tigers, but lacks specific lion characteristics.\n- **Player 3:** Talks about a large feline with an impressive roar and solitary hunting style, which is more indicative of a tiger.\n- **Player 4:** Describes a top predator found in dense forests and grasslands, which is more typical of a tiger's habitat.\n\n**Round 3:**\n- **Player 1:** Describes a large feline found in Africa, known for cooperative hunting and lounging in the sun, which is characteristic of lions.\n- **Player 2:** Talks about physical strength, agility, and being used in logos and emblems, which could apply to both lions and tigers but lacks specific lion traits.\n- **Player 3:** Mentions being found in Asian jungles and cultural significance, which points to a tiger.\n- **Player 4:** Describes a roar heard from miles away and being a symbol of strength and courage, which could apply to both but lacks specific lion traits.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- **Player 1** consistently describes characteristics specific to lions, such as the golden mane, social pride structure, and African habitat.\n- **Player 2** provides descriptions that are more general or applicable to both lions and tigers but lacks specific lion traits.\n- **Player 3** consistently describes characteristics specific to tigers, such as orange and black stripes, solitary hunting, and Asian habitat.\n- **Player 4** also describes characteristics more aligned with tigers, such as distinctive stripes and dense forest habitat.\n\nBased on the analysis, **Player 2** is the spy. Their descriptions are more general and do not specifically align with the lion, which is the word for the normal players.\n\nFinal Spy: Player 2"
