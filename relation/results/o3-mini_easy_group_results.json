Identify good relationships:\n• C is good with I, F, and A (statements 3, 7, 9). So we place A, C, F, I in one group.\n• J is good with E, D, and B (statements 5, 6, 11). So we place B, D, E, J in a second group.\n• H is good with G (statement 8). So H and G form a third group.\n\nStep 2. Confirm separations using bad relationships:\n• I, C (group 1) both have bad relationships with H (statements 2 and 10), keeping group 1 separate from H’s group.\n• J (group 2) has a bad relationship with H (statement 4) and I (group 1) (statement 12), so group 2 remains separate.\n• E and G are noted to have a bad relationship (statement 1), ensuring that G stays out of group 2.\n\nStep 3. Answer the question:\nWe need to list everyone who has a good relationship with H. Since H is in group {H, G}, the only person (besides H) is G.\n\nFinal Answer: G"

List the given relationships:\n• B and I: bad\n• E and B: good\n• I and D: good\n• E and F: bad\n• C and E: bad\n• C and F: bad\n• B and H: bad\n• H and A: good\n• H and G: good\n• H and C: good\n• I and F: good\n\nStep 2. Form groups based on “good” ties (remember that every pair within a group has a good relationship):\n\n• From I and F (good), and I and D (good), we group F, I, D together.\n  – Thus, Group 1: {F, I, D}\n\n• E and B are good, so they form a group.\n  – Group 2: {E, B}\n\n• H is good with A, G, and C, so these form a group.\n  – Group 3: {H, A, G, C}\n\nStep 3. Confirm cross-group bad relationships:\n• B and I are bad (Group 2 and Group 1) – consistent.\n• E and F are bad (Group 2 and Group 1) – consistent.\n• C and F are bad (Group 3 and Group 1) – consistent.\n• B and H are bad (Group 2 and Group 3) – consistent.\n• C and E are bad (Group 3 and Group 2) – consistent.\n\nStep 4. Answer the question:\nThe question asks: Who has a good relationship with F?\nSince F is in Group 1 with I and D (and no other person is connected via “good”), F’s good relationships are with I and D.\n\nOrdering alphabetically: D, I\n\nFinal Answer: D, I"

Form Groups Involving Good Relationships (using transitivity):\n• A is directly connected in good relationships with C, E, B, and F. Because good relationships are transitive, these people form one group: {A, B, C, E, F}.\n• H is directly connected with G and D (H and G; H and D). Thus, H, G, and D form another group: {H, G, D}.\n\nStep 3. Verify Separation by Bad Relationships:\n• C and H have a bad relationship. Since C is in group {A, B, C, E, F} and H is in group {H, G, D}, this confirms that these two groups are separate. Additionally, C and G also have a bad relationship, which is consistent with these groupings.\n\nStep 4. Answer the Question:\nThe question asks who has a good relationship with H. Since H is in the group {H, G, D}, the people who have a good relationship with H (other than H herself) are D and G.\n\nFinal Answer: D, G"

Identify groups based on the good-relationship chains:\n\n• From (3), (8), and (9) we know:\n  C and A are good,\n  C and F are good,\n  C and E are good.\n So A, C, F, and E all share a good relationship (by transitivity). Call this Group 1.\n\n• From (1), (7) and (11):\n  H and D are good,\n  H and B are good,\n  H and G are good.\n Thus B, D, G, and H form another group. (Also note (12) states C and H have a bad relationship—this confirms that H is in a separate group from Group 1.)\n\n• From (6):\n  J and I are good.\n They form Group 3.\n Also, the bad relationships (2), (4), and (10) ensure that J is not in Group 1 or Group 2.\n\nStep 2. Answer the specific question:\nThe question is: “Who has a good relationship with A?”\n\nSince A is in Group 1 (which consists of A, C, E, F), all other people in Group 1 have a good relationship with A.
