Using the transitivity rules (if A–B and B–C are good, then A–C are good) and the rule for bad relationships, we can form groups where everyone in the group is good with each other.\n\nStep 1: Group around C\n- C is good with B, D, F, J, O, and H.\n- Group 1 becomes: {C, B, D, F, J, O, H}\n- Note: Since A is bad with D, A can’t join here. Also, C has bad relations with K and N, so they are excluded.\n\nStep 2: Group around M\n- M is good with E and A.\n- Group 2 becomes: {M, E, A}\n- (Also, since M is bad with C and K, neither join this group.)\n\nStep 3: Group around K\n- K is good with P, G, L, N, and I.\n- Group 3 becomes: {K, P, G, L, N, I}\n- (Note: Although C and K are bad, N is good with K, which is acceptable inside group 3 as the relationship here is defined by K’s good connections.)\n\nStep 4: Verification\n- All individuals from A to P appear in one of these three groups, and no cross-group conflict exists based on the provided relationship information and transitivity rules.\n\nThus, there are 3 distinct groups."

Bad relationships force people into separate groups.\n\nStep 1. Identify positive (good) relationships and form clusters:\n\n• M is directly good with E, F, and B. (M–E, M–F, M–B) → This forms the first group: {M, E, F, B}.\n\n• H is good with C, and C is good with D and O. (H–C, C–D, C–O) → This yields the second group: {H, C, D, O}.\n\n• L is good with N, A, and I. (L–N, L–A, L–I) → Forming the third group: {L, N, A, I}.\n\n• J is good with P, and also J is good with K, and J is good with G. (J–P, J–K, J–G; note K and G then belong to the same group as J) → This gives the fourth group: {J, P, K, G}.\n\nStep 2. Verify using the provided bad relationship statements:\n\n– M has a bad relationship with H, L, and K. This makes sure that the group containing M ({M, E, F, B}) is separate from the groups containing H (and its cluster), L (its cluster), and K (its cluster with J, P, G).\n\n– H has a bad relationship with K and L, which keeps group {H, C, D, O} separate from groups containing K and L.\n\n– Other given bad relationships, such as between G and M (G is in the J group and M in the M group), are consistent with these separation rules.\n\nWith all 16 people (A–P) distributed into these 4 distinct groups, the answer is 4.\n\nFinal Answer: 4"

By transitivity, these people all share good relationships with one another, forming one group: {C, F, O, G, J, M, D}.\n • From the relations involving K (which is explicitly bad with C), K is good with A, N, I, L, and H. Thus they form another group: {K, A, N, I, L, H}.\n • The remaining relationship, E and B (good with each other) forms a separate pair. Notably, K has a bad relationship with E and C has a bad relationship with E, confirming that E (and B by extension) cannot join the other groups. So we have the group {E, B}.\n\n3. All 15 people are now allocated to:\n • Group 1: {C, F, O, G, J, M, D} (7 people)\n • Group 2: {K, A, N, I, L, H} (6 people)\n • Group 3: {E, B} (2 people)\n\nHence, there are 3 distinct groups."
