The number of good relationship pairs within Group 1 is calculated using the combination formula C(n, 2) = n(n-1)/2, where n is the number of people in the group.\n    - C(8, 2) = 8 * 7 / 2 = 28 pairs.\n  - Group 2 has 7 people.

A has good relationships with C, G, J, H, I, F, and N. By transitivity, all these people have good relationships with each other. So, Group 1 is {A, C, G, J, H, I, F, N}.\n\n   - **Group 2:** Start with K. K has good relationships with B, M, E, O, D, and L. By transitivity, all these people have good relationships with each other. So, Group 2 is {K, B, M, E, O, D, L}.\n\n2. **Determine Relationships Between Groups:**\n\n   - A and C have a good relationship, but C and K have a bad relationship. Therefore, everyone in Group 1 has a bad relationship with everyone in Group 2.\n\n3. **Count Good Relationships:**\n\n   - **Within Group 1:** There are 8 people in Group 1. The number of good relationship pairs is given by the combination formula C(n, 2) = n(n-1)/2, where n is the number of people in the group. So, C(8, 2) = 8*7/2 = 28 pairs.\n\n   - **Within Group 2:** There are 7 people in Group 2. The number of good relationship pairs is C(7, 2) = 7*6/2 = 21 pairs.\n\n   - Total good relationships = 28 (Group 1) + 21 (Group 2) = 49 pairs.\n\n4. **Count Bad Relationships:**\n\n   - **Between Group 1 and Group 2:** There are 8 people in Group 1 and 7 people in Group 2. Each person in Group 1 has a bad relationship with each person in Group 2. So, the number of bad relationship pairs is 8 * 7 = 56 pairs.\n\n   - There are no bad relationships within the groups themselves, as all members within a group have good relationships.\n\n5. **Final Answer:**\n\n   - Total good relationships: 49 pairs.\n   - Total bad relationships: 56 pairs.\n\nFinal Answer: 49 pairs have good relationships, 56 pairs have bad relationships."
