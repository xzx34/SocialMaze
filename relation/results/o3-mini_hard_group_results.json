If A and B are good, and B and C are good, then A and C are also good.\n2. If A and B have a bad relationship, and A has a good relationship with C, then B and C must have a bad relationship.\n\nWe can summarize the provided information:\n\n• I and K are bad.\n• C and M are bad.\n• K and F are good.\n• C and L are bad.\n• H and I are good.\n• H and E are good.\n• K and N are good.\n• C and O are good.\n• C and J are good.\n• C and G are good.\n• L and K are bad.\n• L and D are good.\n• C and B are good.\n• K and M are good.\n• I and C are bad.\n• H and A are good.\n• C and K are bad (again).\n• E and N are bad.\n• I and L are bad.\n\nA careful look reveals natural groupings based on mutually “good” relationships that—by transitivity—form separate groups.

However, since C is bad with M (and with K), C belongs to a different group.\n• H is good with I, E, and A, forming a separate group.\n• C is good with O, J, G, and B, forming another group.\n• L is explicitly stated to be good with D.\n\nAlso, L has bad relationships with C, K, and I, which confirms that L cannot be in any groups containing any of those people.\n\nThus, L’s only connection by “good” relationship is with D.

Direct good relationships:\n – A is good with H, M, G, I, J, and F.\n – L is good with C, N, and D.\n – K is good with B and E.\n\n2.

Forming groups using the transitivity of “good” relationships:\n • Group with A:\n  A’s direct good connections are H, M, G, I, J, and F. Since good is transitive, they all form a group:\n   Group A = {A, F, G, H, I, J, M}\n\n • Group with K:\n  K is directly good with B and E:\n   Group K = {K, B, E}\n  Note: Because H (from Group A) is bad with K, and A (in Group A) is good with H, by the second rule everyone in Group A must be bad with everyone in Group K. Thus, these groups remain distinct.\n\n • Group with L:\n  L is directly good with C, N, and D:\n   Group L = {L, C, D, N}\n  Additionally, L has bad relations with people in both of the other groups, which confirms that Group L is separate.\n\n4.

Because a good relationship is transitive, everyone in K’s group is in a good relationship with each other. In other words, E, I, L, M, and K all have good relationships among themselves.\n\nThe remaining statements involve other people such as C, J, D, etc. However, note that multiple statements indicate bad relationships between K and C (and consequently with others in C’s circle). For example, the statement “C and K have a bad relationship” tells us that the group including K (E, I, L, M, K) is separate from C’s group. Therefore, no additional person besides those already linked to K has a good relationship with L.\n\nSince L is in the same group as K, and that group consists of K, E, I, and M (besides L), the people who have a good relationship with L are E, I, K, and M.\n\nWe list the names in alphabetical order.\n\nFinal Answer: E, I, K, M"

B and C have a bad relationship.\n\nStep 2. Identify the group that contains N.\n\nWe see from statement 13 that F and N have a good relationship. Then using the transitive property (“if A is good with B and B is good with C then A is good with C”), we collect everyone who is connected by “good” ties to F.\n\nFrom F we have:\n• F and K (statement 10) → K is in F’s group.\n• F and D (statement 12) → D is in F’s group.\n• F and N (statement 13) → N is in F’s group.\n• F and G (statement 17) → G is in F’s group.\n• F and E (statement 18) → E is in F’s group.\n• F and A (statement 19) → A is in F’s group.\n\nSo so far, the group containing F (and hence N) is: {A, D, E, F, G, K, N}.\n\nStep 3. Check for conflicts with other given relationships\n\nNotice:\n• K is in this group. The information tells us that K has a bad relationship with I (statement 1) and C (statement 2) and J (statement 7). Since everyone in a group must be connected by good relationships, I, C, and J cannot be in F’s group.\n• There are other clusters. For example, I and B have a mutual good relationship (statement 3) forming the group {B, I} (and because I is bad with F via K, this group stays separate).\n• Another cluster is built around C. From C we have good relationships with P, O, L, and M (statements 4, 5, 15, and 16); meanwhile, C is noted to be on bad terms with I, J, and K (statements 6, 9, and 20), keeping this cluster separate.\n• J’s good relationship with H (statement 8), together with the bad links J has with I, C, and K, form the group {H, J}.\n\nThus the complete partition of the 16 people into groups is:\n• Group 1 (F’s group): A, D, E, F, G, K, N\n• Group 2: B, I\n• Group 3: C, L, M, O, P\n• Group 4: H, J\n\nStep 4.

By the transitive property, every person who is in a good relationship with A is also in a good relationship with K. This group includes: A, I, H, F, M, N, and E.\n• The other set (C, L, B, D, G, and J) is entirely separate given the conflicting (bad) relationship between K and C.\n\nStep 3.

Form the groups using the good relationships (transitively) while keeping in mind that if two people (or groups) have any stated bad relationship between them, they must be kept separate.\n\n• Look at N’s ties:  \n  – Direct goods from N are: O, E, P, D, B.  \n  – So, one group is Group 1 = {N, O, E, P, D, B}.\n\n• Look at C’s ties:  \n  – Direct goods from C are: I, G, H, F.  \n  – So, Group 2 = {C, I, G, H, F}.  \n  – (Notice C and N have a bad relationship so Group 2 cannot join Group 1.)\n\n• Next, consider L’s ties:  \n  – L is good with K and M.  \n  – Thus Group 3 = {K, L, M}.  \n  – (We also note that L is bad with C and N, so this group stays separate.)\n\n• Finally, the pair with J:  \n  – J is good with A.  \n  – Thus Group 4 = {J, A}.  \n  – (J is bad with N, C, and L; so it cannot join with any of the other groups.)\n\nStep 4.

Also, H, E, O are added to K’s group because good relationships are transitive.\n\nStep 2. Look at the rest of the information to verify groups:\n\nA group is defined as a set where every member has a good relationship with every other member. By examining the other provided relationships, we can partition the 16 people into distinct groups.\n\nOne group (Group 1):\n • From the above, we have K, P, H, E, and O.\n Also note that because K is not good with C (and similarly not with G), these latter members belong in other groups.\n\nOther groups (for completeness):\n • Relationships with C (and those good with C: A, B, J, and N) form another group.\n • Relationships with F (and those good with F: D, I, M, L, and G) form yet another group.\n\nThis segmentation is consistent with all the provided relationships and the rule that if someone in one group is bad with someone in another, then everyone in their respective groups has a bad relationship with each other.\n\nStep 3.

Identify groups based on “good” relationships (using transitivity). Notice that:\n\n• From N’s “good” relationships we have: E, L, D, I, and B are good with N.

This means that M, H, and F belong to another group.  \n  Group 2: {M, H, F}\n\n• Now look at the remaining person C and his good relationships.  \n  C is bad with both N and M, so C must be in a group separate from Groups 1 and 2.  \n  C has good relationships with A, J, G, and K.
