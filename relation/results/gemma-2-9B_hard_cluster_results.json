So, {A, I, E, B, O, D, H, M, G} form a group.\n\n2. **Group 2: C and its connections:**\n   - C has good relationships with: K, L, F, J.\n   - C has a bad relationship with: N.\n   - K has a good relationship with C, but a bad relationship with M.

This means M and N are not in the same group. However, we already know that M is in the group with C, and N is in the group with A. This is consistent with the bad relationship between the two groups.\n\n5. **Remaining people:**\n   - There are 15 people in total. We have identified groups containing A, J, O, I, E, D, K, N and C, B, G, M, L, F, H. This accounts for 14 people.\n   - Person P is not mentioned in any relationship. Therefore, P is in a group by itself.\n   - Similarly, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z are not mentioned in any relationship.
