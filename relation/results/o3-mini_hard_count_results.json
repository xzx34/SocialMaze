Identify the groups based on good relationships (remember that good relationships are transitive).\n\n• According to the statements:\n – B is directly good with F, N, M, D, C, I, and K.\n  ⇒ Group 1 (so far): {B, F, N, M, D, C, I, K}.\n – H is directly good with J, E, O, L, G, and A.\n  ⇒ Group 2 (so far): {H, J, E, O, L, G, A}.\n\nStep 2. Check for conflicts with bad relationships.\n – It is given that H and C have a bad relationship.\n  Since C is in Group 1 (with B) and H is in Group 2, the groups must be separate.\n – It is also given that E and M have a bad relationship.\n  Since M is in Group 1 and E is in Group 2, this also confirms the separation.\n\nThus, all 15 people (labeled A to O) are divided into two groups without any overlap:\n • Group 1: {B, D, F, I, K, M, N, C}  (Number of people = 8)\n • Group 2: {A, E, G, H, J, L, O}    (Number of people = 7)\n\nWithin each group, by definition, every pair of people has a good relationship (by transitivity). Every pair formed by selecting one person from Group 1 and one from Group 2 will have a bad relationship.\n\nStep 3. Count the pairs.\n Good relationships:\n  – In Group 1: The number of pairs = 8C2 = (8×7)/2 = 28.\n  – In Group 2: The number of pairs = 7C2 = (7×6)/2 = 21.\n  Total good pairs = 28 + 21 = 49.\n\n Bad relationships:\n  – Every pair with one person from Group 1 (8 people) and one from Group 2 (7 people) is a bad pair.\n  Total bad pairs = 8 × 7 = 56.\n\nFinal Answer: 49 pairs have good relationships, 56 pairs have bad relationships."

      "response": "Let's start by figuring out which people belong to the same “good” group by using the given good relationship information and then use the bad relationship information (and the transitivity rules) to verify that people from different groups share bad relationships with each other.\n\nStep 1. Identify the good relationships and build the groups:\n\n• K and C have a good relationship.\n• K and D have a good relationship.\n• K and I have a good relationship.\n\nThis tells us that K, C, D, and I all belong together. We’ll call this Group K.\n\n• N and B have a good relationship.\n• N and A have a good relationship.\n• N and J have a good relationship.\n• N and H have a good relationship.\n• N and E have a good relationship.\n\nSo, N, B, A, J, H, and E form another group. We’ll call this Group N.\n\n• L and M have a good relationship.\n• L and F have a good relationship.\n• L and G have a good relationship.\n\nThus, L, M, F, and G form another group, which we’ll call Group L.\n\nAt this point, we have accounted for all 14 people:\n Group N: {A, B, E, H, J, N} (6 people)\n Group K: {C, D, I, K} (4 people)\n Group L: {F, G, L, M} (4 people)\n\nStep 2. Incorporate the bad relationships (and check transitivity):\n\nThe provided bad relationships are:\n• B and M have a bad relationship. (B is in Group N and M is in Group L.)\n• N and L have a bad relationship. (N is in Group N and L is in Group L.)\n• C and L have a bad relationship. (C is in Group K and L is in Group L.)\n• K and L have a bad relationship. (K is in Group K and L is in Group L.)\n• N and K have a bad relationship. (N is in Group N and K is in Group K.)\n\nBecause of the rule “if someone from one group has a bad relationship with someone from another group then everyone from the first group has a bad relationship with everyone from the other group”, these edges force all inter-group pairs to be bad. In our case, every pair taken between:\n Group N and Group K,\n Group N and Group L,\n Group K and Group L,\nwill be bad.\n\nStep 3. Counting the pairs:\n\nTotal pairs among 14 people: 14 choose 2 = 91.\n\n(a) Good relationship pairs are those within each group.\n Group N (6 people): (6 choose 2) = 15 pairs.\n Group K (4 people): (4 choose 2) = 6 pairs.\n Group L (4 people): (4 choose 2) = 6 pairs.\nTotal good pairs = 15 + 6 + 6 = 27.\n\n(b) Bad relationship pairs are all pairs across different groups.\n Between Group N (6) and Group K (4): 6 × 4 = 24 pairs.\n Between Group N (6) and Group L (4): 6 × 4 = 24 pairs.\n Between Group K (4) and Group L (4): 4 × 4 = 16 pairs.\nTotal bad pairs = 24 + 24 + 16 = 64.\n\nThus, based solely on the provided relationship data and applying the rules:\n\nFinal Answer: 27 pairs have good relationships, 64 pairs have bad relationships."

Define the groups:\n– Group A: Those connected with A by good relationships. This group is {A, L, O, H, I, B, E, N} (8 people).\n– Group C: Those connected with C by good relationships.

A bad relationship is also transitive with respect to good ties: if A is bad with B and A is good with C, then B and C must be bad with each other. In this problem, once groups are established (everyone within a group is good with each other), everyone in one group is bad with everyone in the other groups.\n\nStep 1. Identify the groups.\n\nFrom the given data:\n• A has a good relationship with C, G, J, H, I, F, and N.\n  Thus, Group 1 = {A, C, G, J, H, I, F, N}.\n\n• K has a good relationship with B, M, E, O, D, and L.\n  Thus, Group 2 = {K, B, M, E, O, D, L}.\n\nThe information “C and K have a bad relationship” confirms that Group 1 and Group 2 are separate groups. Also, the “B and F have a bad relationship” reinforces that the groups are distinct. There are 15 people total and they are all in one of these two groups (8 in Group 1 and 7 in Group 2).\n\nStep 2. Count the pairs of good relationships.\n\nInside each group, every pair has a good relationship.\n\n• In Group 1 (8 people) the number of pairs = 8C2 = 28.\n• In Group 2 (7 people) the number of pairs = 7C2 = 21.\n\nTotal good pairs = 28 + 21 = 49.\n\nStep 3.

The information provided and the stated rules (transitivity within good relationships and the effect of a “bad” crossing a “good”) force the people to break into groups in which everyone is “good” with everyone else, and any person in one group is “bad” with every person in any other group.\n\nStep 1. Identify the direct good and bad relationships:\n\n• Good:\n – N with G\n – N with A\n – N with J\n – N with M\n – N with F\n – C with H\n – C with K\n – C with E\n – C with I\n – L with D\n – L with B\n\n• Bad:\n – N with C\n – L with C\n – N with L\n – D with K\n – H with J\n\nStep 2. Form groups based on the “good” relationships (remembering that if A is “good” with B, and B is “good” with C, then A is “good” with C):\n\n• From N’s relationships:\n N is “good” with G, A, J, M, and F.\n Thus one group is: Group 1 = {N, G, A, J, M, F} (6 people).\n\n• From C’s relationships:\n C is “good” with H, K, E, and I.\n Thus another group is: Group 2 = {C, H, K, E, I} (5 people).\n\n• From L’s relationships:\n L is “good” with D and B.\n Thus the third group is: Group 3 = {L, D, B} (3 people).\n\nStep 3. Verify with the “bad” information:\n – N and C are in Group 1 and Group 2 respectively → bad (as given).\n – L and C are in Group 3 and Group 2 respectively → bad.\n – N and L are in Group 1 and Group 3 respectively → bad.\n – D (Group 3) and K (Group 2) → bad.\n – H (Group 2) and J (Group 1) → bad.\nAll information is now consistent with the groups.\n\nStep 4. Count pairs within each group:\n Within a group, every pair has a good relationship.\n • Group 1 (6 people): Number of good pairs = 6 choose 2 = 15.\n • Group 2 (5 people): Number of good pairs = 5 choose 2 = 10.\n • Group 3 (3 people): Number of good pairs = 3 choose 2 = 3.\n Total good pairs = 15 + 10 + 3 = 28.\n\nStep 5. Count bad pairs:\n Since every pair from different groups is bad by rule, we can either count these directly or subtract the good pairs (which are only within groups) from the total pairs among 14 people.\n • Total pairs among 14 = 14 choose 2 = 91.\n • Thus, bad pairs = 91 − 28 = 63.\n\nFinal Answer: 28 pairs have good relationships, 63 pairs have bad relationships."

C and G have a bad relationship.\n4. B and E have a bad relationship.\n\nStep 1. Identify Groups Based on “Good” Relationships\n\n• From (1), C, H, M, A, B, and K form one group. We call this Group 1.\n• From (2), D, G, L, N, E, J, F, and I form another group. We call this Group 2.\n\nStep 2. Confirm Group Separation\n\n• The extra facts (3) and (4) indicate a bad relationship between a member of Group 1 (C or B) and a member of Group 2 (G or E). The relationship rules then imply that every person in Group 1 has a bad relationship with every person in Group 2.\n\nStep 3. Count “Good” Relationship Pairs\n\nWithin a group every pair has a good relationship.\n• For Group 1 with 6 people, the number of pairs is 6C2 = (6×5)/2 = 15.\n• For Group 2 with 8 people, the number of pairs is 8C2 = (8×7)/2 = 28.\n\nTotal good pairs = 15 + 28 = 43.\n\nStep 4. Count “Bad” Relationship Pairs\n\nA bad relationship exists between each person in Group 1 and each person in Group 2.\n• The number of bad pairs = 6 (Group 1) × 8 (Group 2) = 48.\n\nFinal Answer: 43 pairs have good relationships, 48 pairs have bad relationships."

E and N have a bad relationship  \n19. I and L have a bad relationship  \n\nRecall that good relationships are transitive: if A is good with B and B is good with C, then A is good with C. That means people connected by “good” relations form a “group” where everyone is good with everyone else. Also, if one person (say A) is good with someone in their own group, and A has a bad relationship with some other person B, then every person in A’s group must have a bad relationship with B (and with the entire group that B belongs to) by the transitivity rule for bad relationships.\n\nStep 1. Grouping via good relationships\n\nIdentify the “good” links:\n\n• K–F (relationship 3), K–N (7), and K–M (14) indicate that K, F, N, and M are in one group. Call this Group 1: {K, F, N, M}.  \n• H–I (5), H–E (6), and H–A (16) put H, I, E, and A together into Group 2: {H, I, E, A}.  \n• C–O (8), C–J (9), C–G (10), and C–B (13) yield Group 3: {C, O, J, G, B}.  \n• L–D (12) gives Group 4: {L, D}.\n\nStep 2. Check consistency with “bad” links\n\nSeveral bad relationships occur between people in different groups:\n• I (Group 2) and K (Group 1) are bad (1)  \n• C (Group 3) and M (Group 1) are bad (2)  \n• C (Group 3) and L (Group 4) are bad (4)  \n• L (Group 4) and K (Group 1) are bad (11)  \n• I (Group 2) and C (Group 3) are bad (15)  \n• C (Group 3) and K (Group 1) are bad (17)  \n• E (Group 2) and N (Group 1) are bad (18)  \n• I (Group 2) and L (Group 4) are bad (19)  \n\nBecause the rules enforce that if one cross-group pair is bad then all pairs between the two groups must be bad, this confirms that:\n– Every person in Group 1 is bad with every person in Groups 2, 3, and 4  \n– Every person in Group 2 is bad with every person in Groups 1, 3, and 4  \n– Every person in Group 3 is bad with every person in Groups 1, 2, and 4  \n– Every person in Group 4 is bad with every person in Groups 1, 2, and 3  \n\nAlso, within each group, by the transitivity of good relationships, every pair shares a good relationship.\n\nStep 3. Count intra‐group “good” pairs\n\nFor a group of n people, there are n(n−1)/2 pairs. The group sizes are:\n• Group 1 (4 people): 4×3/2 = 6 pairs  \n• Group 2 (4 people): 4×3/2 = 6 pairs  \n• Group 3 (5 people): 5×4/2 = 10 pairs  \n• Group 4 (2 people): 2×1/2 = 1 pair  \n\nTotal good pairs = 6 + 6 + 10 + 1 = 23 pairs.\n\nStep 4. Count “bad” pairs (pairs from different groups)\n\nThere are 15 people in total, so the total number of pairs is 15×14/2 = 105. Since every pair not in the same group is now bad:\nTotal bad pairs = 105 (all pairs) − 23 (good pairs) = 82 pairs.\n\nFinal Answer: 23 pairs have good relationships, 82 pairs have bad relationships."

Verify the bad relationships respect the grouping:\n – I and C are from Groups 1 and 2 → bad relationship implies all in Group 1 are bad with all in Group 2.  \n – C and K are from Groups 2 and 3 → all in Group 2 are bad with all in Group 3.  \n – I and K are from Groups 1 and 3 → all in Group 1 are bad with all in Group 3.  \n – C and E (Group 2 vs. Group 1) and H and J (Group 2 vs. Group 3) further confirm these separations.\n\nThus, the three groups are completely separated by bad relationships.\n\nStep 3.

Form the groups using good relationships:\n\n• Starting with C:  \n – Directly, C has good relationships with K, A, I, and M.  \n – Because good relationships are transitive, all these people share a good relationship with each other.  \n  Group 1 = {A, C, I, K, M}.\n\n• Next, from H:  \n – H is directly good with G, B, L, and O.  \n – Thus, by transitivity, Group 2 = {H, G, B, L, O}.\n\n• Then, from N:  \n – N is directly good with D, F, E, and J.  \n – So, Group 3 = {N, D, F, E, J}.\n\nStep 2. Check the remaining direct statements about bad relationships:\n\n• C has bad relationships with G, H, and N.  \n – Since C is in Group 1, G and H (in Group 2) as well as N (in Group 3) are in groups different from Group 1.  \n• H and N have a bad relationship: H is in Group 2 and N is in Group 3.  \n• F and I have a bad relationship: F is in Group 3 and I is in Group 1.\n\nThese confirm that the groups are completely separate and that every person from one group has a bad relationship with every person from another group.\n\nStep 3.

Wherever a “bad” relationship is given between two people who otherwise “span” different good‐clusters, the rule “if A is bad with B, and A is good with C, then B and C are bad” forces an entire separation into distinct groups. In our problem the 16 people (A through P) break into four groups as follows (the grouping is forced by comparing all the given relations):\n\n• Group 1. K is good with N, E, A, and D. None of these are “mixed” with anyone from another group by virtue of any indirect good connection. Thus, Group 1 = {K, N, E, A, D}.  \n   Good pairs = 5C2 = 10\n\n• Group 2. C has good relations with O, G, H, and M. Hence, Group 2 = {C, O, G, H, M}.  \n   Good pairs = 5C2 = 10\n\n• Group 3. J is directly good with I and B. Thus, Group 3 = {J, I, B}.  \n   Good pairs = 3C2 = 3\n\n• Group 4. L is “tied” by good connections to P (L and P are good) and to F (L and F are good).

(This is exactly how the problem defines separate “groups.”)\n\nNow, count the overall number of “good” pairs. Within a group every pair is good, and there are no other good relations:\n\n• Group 1: 5 members → 5C2 = 10  \n• Group 2: 5 members → 5C2 = 10  \n• Group 3: 3 members → 3C2 = 3  \n• Group 4: 3 members → 3C2 = 3\n\nTotal good pairs = 10 + 10 + 3 + 3 = 26.\n\nSince there are 16 people total, the total number of pairs (regardless of relation) is 16C2 = 120.

      "response": "We start by noting that there are 16 people (A–P), and we must use the following rules:\n1. If two people have a direct good relationship, and one of them has a good relationship with a third person, then the good relationship is transitive.\n2. If person X has a bad relationship with person Y, and X has a good relationship with Z, then Y and Z must also have a bad relationship.\n3. A group is defined so that every person in the group has a good relationship with every other person, and any pair in different groups have a bad relationship.\n\nStep 1. List the given relationships:\n• C and J have a good relationship.\n• A and B have a good relationship.\n• C and L have a good relationship.\n• K and C have a bad relationship.\n• C and N have a good relationship.\n• A and E have a good relationship.\n• B and J have a bad relationship.\n• A and H have a good relationship.\n• A and D have a good relationship.\n• A and K have a good relationship.\n• C and F have a good relationship.\n• C and O have a good relationship.\n• A and P have a good relationship.\n• A and M have a good relationship.\n• C and I have a good relationship.\n• A and G have a good relationship.\n\nStep 2. Form groups using transitivity.\n• Notice that A is directly connected (by good relationships) to B, E, H, D, K, P, M, and G based on the facts “A and B”, “A and E”, “A and H”, “A and D”, “A and K”, “A and P”, “A and M”, “A and G”. Thus, one group can be:\n  Group 1: {A, B, E, H, D, K, P, M, G}.\n• Meanwhile, C is directly connected with J, L, N, F, O, I (from “C and J”, “C and L”, “C and N”, “C and F”, “C and O”, “C and I”). This gives the other group:\n  Group 2: {C, J, L, N, F, O, I}.\n\nStep 3. Verify using the cross-group bad relationships.\n• K is in Group 1 and we are given “K and C have a bad relationship.” Also, “B and J have a bad relationship” where B is in Group 1 and J in Group 2. According to the rules, if one pair in different groups have a bad relationship, then every member of one group has a bad relationship with every member of the other group.\n\nThus, the two groups are:\n  Group 1 (9 people): A, B, E, H, D, K, P, M, G\n  Group 2 (7 people): C, J, L, N, F, O, I\n\nStep 4. Counting pairs within groups (good relationships).\n- For a group of n people, the number of pairs (each pair having a good relationship) is n(n – 1)/2.\n• Group 1: n = 9 yields 9 × 8 / 2 = 36 pairs.\n• Group 2: n = 7 yields 7 × 6 / 2 = 21 pairs.\n• Total good relationship pairs = 36 + 21 = 57.\n\nStep 5. Counting pairs between groups (bad relationships).\n- Every person in Group 1 has a bad relationship with every person in Group 2.\n• That is 9 × 7 = 63 pairs.\n\nFinal Answer: 57 pairs have good relationships, 63 pairs have bad relationships."

      "response": "We begin by noting that there are 15 people (A–O) and that “good” relationships are transitive and define groups (equivalence classes) while “bad” relationships occur between groups. Two people are in the same group if they have a chain of “good” relationships connecting them, and when one person in one group is bad toward someone in another, then every person in the first group must be bad toward every person in the second group.\n\nLet’s list the relationships:\n\n1. C and A – good\n2. K and N – good\n3. K and D – good\n4. K and L – bad\n5. F and L – bad\n6. C and E – good\n7. N and O – bad\n8. C and F – good\n9. K and J – good\n10. L and G – good\n11.

Determine the “good” groups:\n\n• Starting with C:  \n • C is good with A, E, F, O, I, B.  \n  ⇒ Group 1 = {A, B, C, E, F, I, O}.\n\n• Next, consider K (note that C and K are bad, so K is not in Group 1):  \n • K is good with N, D, J, M, and H.  \n  ⇒ Group 2 = {K, N, D, J, M, H}.\n\n• Now, check L and G:  \n • L is good with G (and nothing links L with the above groups via good relationships).  \n  ⇒ Group 3 = {L, G}.\n\nStep 2. Verify using the provided “bad” relationships:  \n• K and L are bad, C and L are bad, and F and L are bad. These ensure that Group 1 and Group 2 are separate from Group 3.  \n• Also, N and O are bad; since N is in Group 2 and O in Group 1, this too confirms the separation.\n\nThus, our groups are:\n Group 1: 7 people (A, B, C, E, F, I, O)  \n Group 2: 6 people (K, N, D, J, M, H)  \n Group 3: 2 people (L, G)\n\nStep 3. Count the pairs with “good” relationships:\nWithin a group, every pair is a “good” relationship.\n • In Group 1: Number of pairs = 7C2 = 7×6/2 = 21  \n • In Group 2: Number of pairs = 6C2 = 6×5/2 = 15  \n • In Group 3: Number of pairs = 2C2 = 1  \n Total “good” pairs = 21 + 15 + 1 = 37\n\nStep 4. Count the pairs with “bad” relationships:\nSince every pair of people from different groups must be “bad” (by the rules), the total “bad” pairs equals the total pairs among 15 people minus the “good” pairs.  \n • Total pairs among 15 = 15C2 = 15×14/2 = 105  \n • “Bad” pairs = 105 − 37 = 68\n\nFinal Answer: 37 pairs have good relationships, 68 pairs have bad relationships."

(If A–good–B and B–good–C, then A–good–C.)  \n• “Group” is defined as a set in which every pair is in a good relationship.  \n• Anyone from one group automatically has a bad relationship with everyone in another group.\n\nStep 1. Grouping by Good Relationships\n\nExamine the given information:\n\nA. Notice the links around C.  \n– C is directly good with P (1), I (5), B (7), D (8), G (12) and N (16).  \nThus one group can form: Group C = {C, P, I, B, D, G, N}.\n\nB. Next, consider K.  \n– K is directly good with J (3), F (4), E (6), O (13) and L (17).  \nBut note: C and K are explicitly bad (11) so K cannot join Group C.  \nThus, Group K = {K, J, F, E, O, L}.\n\nC. Finally, look at M’s relationships.  \n– M is directly good with A (10) and H (14).  \nAt the same time, M has bad relationships with K (9) and with C (18).  \nSo M does not go with Group C or Group K.  \nThus, Group M = {M, A, H}.\n\nNow, check that all 16 people are placed:  \nGroup C = {C, P, I, B, D, G, N} (7 people)  \nGroup K = {K, J, F, E, O, L} (6 people)  \nGroup M = {M, A, H} (3 people)  \nTotal: 7 + 6 + 3 = 16 people.\n\nStep 2. Count the Good Relationship Pairs\n\nWithin each “complete” group, every pair of members shares a good relationship.\n\n• For Group C (7 members): number of pairs = C(7,2) = 7 × 6 / 2 = 21  \n• For Group K (6 members): number of pairs = C(6,2) = 6 × 5 / 2 = 15  \n• For Group M (3 members): number of pairs = C(3,2) = 3 × 2 / 2 = 3  \n\nTotal good pairs = 21 + 15 + 3 = 39\n\nStep 3. Count the Bad Relationship Pairs\n\nAny pair of people from different groups automatically have bad relationships. We count the bad pairs by considering every cross-group pairing.\n\n• Pairs between Group C (7 people) and Group K (6 people): 7 × 6 = 42  \n• Pairs between Group C (7 people) and Group M (3 people): 7 × 3 = 21  \n• Pairs between Group K (6 people) and Group M (3 people): 6 × 3 = 18  \n\nTotal bad pairs = 42 + 21 + 18 = 81\n\nFinal Answer: 39 pairs have good relationships, 81 pairs have bad relationships"

In addition, the rules tell us that “good” relationships are transitive and that people are in the same group if and only if they have (directly or via transitivity) good relationships with one another. Also, if any one person in one group has a bad relationship with anyone in another group, then every person in the first group has a bad relationship with every person in the other group.\n\nStep 1. Set Up the Information\n\nWe have 14 people labeled A to N, and the following relationship statements:\n\n1. A and H have a good relationship.\n2. L and C have a good relationship.\n3. K and B have a good relationship.\n4. A and M have a good relationship.\n5. E and L have a bad relationship.\n6. A and G have a good relationship.\n7. L and N have a good relationship.\n8.

L and D have a good relationship.\n14. A and F have a good relationship.\n15. H and L have a bad relationship.\n16. K and L have a bad relationship.\n\nStep 2. Form the “Good” Groups\n\n● Group Containing A:\n – Direct “good” relationships given: A with H, M, G, I, J, F.\n – By transitivity, all of these (A, H, M, G, I, J, F) must all be good with each other.\n – Note: Although A is good with H and H is in this set, other persons have conflicts with those outside. For example, H has a bad relationship with K and L, so K and L (and anyone connected to them through “good” relationships) will not be in A’s group.\n ⇒ Group A = {A, H, M, G, I, J, F}   (7 people)\n\n● Group Containing K:\n – Direct “good” relationships: K with B and K with E.\n – K, B, and E share “good” relationships among themselves.\n ⇒ Group K = {K, B, E}   (3 people)\n\n● Group Containing L:\n – Direct “good” relationships: L with C, L with N, and L with D.\n ⇒ Group L = {L, C, N, D}   (4 people)\n\nCheck on “bad” relationships confirms these divisions:\n• F and K are bad; F is in Group A, and K is in Group K.\n• H and L are bad; H is in Group A, and L is in Group L.\n• K and L are bad; K is in Group K, and L is in Group L.\n• E and L are bad; E is in Group K, and L is in Group L.\n\nThus, the groups are completely distinct.\n\nStep 3. Count the “Good” Pairs Within Each Group\n\nIn any group of n people, the number of pairs with good relationships is given by the combination n choose 2.\n\n• Group A (7 people): 7C2 = (7×6)/2 = 21 pairs\n• Group K (3 people): 3C2 = (3×2)/2 = 3 pairs\n• Group L (4 people): 4C2 = (4×3)/2 = 6 pairs\n\nTotal good pairs = 21 + 3 + 6 = 30 pairs\n\nStep 4. Count the “Bad” Pairs Between Different Groups\n\nSince every pair of people not in the same group must have a bad relationship (and we are given at least one bad relationship between each distinct pair of groups, making the relationship extend by the rules), count the number of cross‐group pairs.\n\nBetween:\n• Group A (7 people) and Group K (3 people): 7 × 3 = 21 pairs\n• Group A (7 people) and Group L (4 people): 7 × 4 = 28 pairs\n• Group K (3 people) and Group L (4 people): 3 × 4 = 12 pairs\n\nTotal bad pairs = 21 + 28 + 12 = 61 pairs\n\nVerification: The total number of pairs among 14 people is 14C2 = 91. Since 91 = 30 (good) + 61 (bad), our count is consistent.\n\nFinal Answer: 30 pairs have good relationships, 61 pairs have bad relationships."

Good relationship transitivity: If X is good with Y and Y is good with Z, then X is good with Z.\n2. Mixed transitivity with bad: If X is bad with Y and X is good with Z, then Y and Z must be bad with each other.\n\nStep 1. Identify the groups “where every member has a good relationship with every other member.”\n\n• Looking at A’s good relationships, we have:\n  A is good with I, D, G, E, C, M, H, L.\n  By transitivity (and the fact these relationships are explicitly good), this gives Group 1:\n   Group 1 = {A, I, D, G, E, C, M, H, L} (9 people).\n\n• Next, note K’s good relationships:\n  K is good with N, J, F, B.\n  That gives Group 2:\n   Group 2 = {K, N, J, F, B} (5 people).\n\nStep 2. Verify separation between groups\n\nNotice the two conflicts:\n • C (in Group 1) and K (in Group 2) have a bad relationship.\n • D (in Group 1) and J (in Group 2) have a bad relationship.\nSince the rules state that if there is even one bad relationship between members of two groups, then every member of one group is in a bad relationship with every member of the other group, Groups 1 and 2 are completely separated.\n\nStep 3. Count the number of good relationships.\n\nWithin each group, every pair of people is in a good relationship. Thus, calculate:\n\n• Group 1 (9 people): Number of pairs = 9 choose 2 = 9×8/2 = 36.\n• Group 2 (5 people): Number of pairs = 5 choose 2 = 5×4/2 = 10.\n\nTotal good pairs = 36 + 10 = 46.\n\nStep 4. Count the number of bad relationships.\n\nBecause the groups are completely separated, every person in Group 1 has a bad relationship with every person in Group 2. That gives:\n\nBad pairs = Size of Group 1 × Size of Group 2 = 9 × 5 = 45.\n\nThere are no bad relationships within a group since all relationships inside a group are good.\n\nFinal Answer: 46 pairs have good relationships, 45 pairs have bad relationships."

Identify Good Relationship Groups\n\nThe provided “good” relationships are:\n• J and I\n• E and A\n• E and B\n• J and M\n• E and D\n• K and G\n• K and F\n• K and C\n• E and L\n\nUsing transitivity for good relationships, we merge those connected:\n1. From E–A, E–B, E–D, E–L, we form Group1 = {E, A, B, D, L}.\n2. From J–I and J–M, we form Group2 = {J, I, M}.\n3. From K–G, K–F, and K–C, we form Group3 = {K, G, F, C}.\n4. Separately, we have N and H from “N and H have a good relationship” forming Group4 = {N, H}.\n\nThus, the four groups are:\n• Group1: {E, A, B, D, L} (5 people)\n• Group2: {J, I, M} (3 people)\n• Group3: {K, G, F, C} (4 people)\n• Group4: {N, H} (2 people)\n\nStep 2. List the Bad Relationships and Their Implications\n\nThe provided “bad” relationships include:\n• E and N (E in Group1, N in Group4)\n• K and J (K in Group3, J in Group2)\n• E and J (E in Group1, J in Group2)\n• N and J (N in Group4, J in Group2)\n• C and N (C in Group3, N in Group4)\n• I and N (I in Group2, N in Group4)\n• K and N (K in Group3, N in Group4)\n• E and K (E in Group1, K in Group3)\n\nBecause a bad relationship between at least one pair in different groups forces everyone in one group to have a bad relationship with everyone in the other group, we have:\n• Group1 has a bad relationship with Groups2, 3, and 4.\n• Group2 has a bad relationship with Groups1, 3, and 4.\n• Group3 has a bad relationship with Groups1, 2, and 4.\n• Group4 has a bad relationship with Groups1, 2, and 3.\n\nStep 3. Count the Pairs\n\nGood pairs are those within each group (each pair within a group is a good relationship):\n• Group1 (5 people): 5 choose 2 = 10 pairs\n• Group2 (3 people): 3 choose 2 = 3 pairs\n• Group3 (4 people): 4 choose 2 = 6 pairs\n• Group4 (2 people): 2 choose 2 = 1 pair\n\nTotal good pairs = 10 + 3 + 6 + 1 = 20 pairs\n\nBad pairs exist between people in different groups. The number of bad pairs is the sum of products of the sizes of every two distinct groups:\n• Between Group1 (5) & Group2 (3): 5 × 3 = 15 pairs\n• Group1 (5) & Group3 (4): 5 × 4 = 20 pairs\n• Group1 (5) & Group4 (2): 5 × 2 = 10 pairs\n• Group2 (3) & Group3 (4): 3 × 4 = 12 pairs\n• Group2 (3) & Group4 (2): 3 × 2 = 6 pairs\n• Group3 (4) & Group4 (2): 4 × 2 = 8 pairs\n\nTotal bad pairs = 15 + 20 + 10 + 12 + 6 + 8 = 71 pairs\n\nAs a check, the total number of pairs among 14 people is C(14, 2) = 91, and 20 + 71 = 91.\n\nFinal Answer: 20 pairs have good relationships, 71 pairs have bad relationships."

We now use the transitivity properties and the definitions given:\n\n1. Every “good” relationship is transitive. That is, if A is good with B and A is good with C then B must be good with C. So starting with A we have:\n  Group 1 (starting from A): A is directly good with H, J, O, N, G, F, E, I, and C. By transitivity, all these people share good relationships with one another. So Group 1 = {A, H, J, O, N, G, F, E, I, C}.\n\n2. The remaining relationships come into play with person K. The statements:\n  K–B, K–M, K–L, and K–D (all good) put B, M, L, and D together with K. Thus, Group 2 = {K, B, M, L, D}.\n\n3. Check the bad relationships and conflicts:\n  • G–M is bad. G is in Group 1 and M is in Group 2.  \n  • C–K is bad. C is in Group 1 and K is in Group 2.\n  Because of the rule “if someone from one group has a bad relationship with someone from another group, then everyone from one group has a bad relationship with everyone in the other group,” these bad pairs are consistent and every person in Group 1 must have a bad relationship with every person in Group 2.\n\nThus, the two groups formed are:  \n  Group 1 (10 people): A, H, J, O, N, G, F, E, I, C  \n  Group 2 (5 people): K, B, M, L, D\n\nNow we count the number of pairs having good and bad relationships:\n\nGood Relationships:\n– Every pair within a group has a good relationship by definition.\n  For Group 1 (10 people): number of pairs = 10 choose 2 = (10×9)/2 = 45  \n  For Group 2 (5 people): number of pairs = 5 choose 2 = (5×4)/2 = 10  \nTotal good pairs = 45 + 10 = 55\n\nBad Relationships:\n– Every pair made by taking one person from Group 1 and one from Group 2 will have a bad relationship.\n  Number of such pairs = (number in Group 1) × (number in Group 2) = 10 × 5 = 50\n\nFinal Answer: 55 pairs have good relationships, 50 pairs have bad relationships."

Forming Groups from Good Relationships\n\nFrom the information involving A:\n• A is in a good relationship with N, E, B, G, K, F, I, and C.\nThus A’s group (let’s call it Group 1) is:\n  Group 1 = {A, N, E, B, G, K, F, I, C} (9 people).\n\nFrom the information involving H:\n• H is in a good relationship with L, M, D, and J.\nThus H’s group (Group 2) is:\n  Group 2 = {H, L, M, D, J} (5 people).\n\nStep 2. Checking for Consistency with the “Bad” Relationships\n\n• “C and H have a bad relationship” tells us that since C is in Group 1 and H is in Group 2, the two groups must be separate.\n• “E and J have a bad relationship” is consistent because E is in Group 1 and J is in Group 2.\n\nThus, the information partitions all 14 people into two groups:\n  Group 1 (9 people): A, N, E, B, G, K, F, I, C.\n  Group 2 (5 people): H, L, M, D, J.\n\nStep 3. Counting the Pairs\n\nGood Relationships:\nWithin each group everyone has a good relationship with each other.\n• Group 1 contributes C(9, 2) = 9×8/2 = 36 pairs.\n• Group 2 contributes C(5, 2) = 5×4/2 = 10 pairs.\nTotal good pairs = 36 + 10 = 46 pairs.\n\nBad Relationships:\nAny two people not in the same group have a bad relationship.\nTotal pairs among 14 people is C(14, 2) = 91.\nSince all 91 pairs are either good (within the same group) or bad (across groups),\nTotal bad pairs = 91 – (good pairs) = 91 – 46 = 45 pairs.\nAlternatively, count cross-group pairs directly as:\n  Group 1 (9) × Group 2 (5) = 45 pairs.\n\nFinal Answer: 46 pairs have good relationships, 45 pairs have bad relationships."

Check the bad relationships given:\n • F and C are bad.\n • B and K are bad.\nSince F is in Group 1 and C in Group 2, and B is in Group 1 and K in Group 2, these bad relationships confirm that people in Group 1 have bad relationships with those in Group 2. By the rules, once one cross-group pair has a bad relationship, every pair across the two groups has a bad relationship.\n\nStep 3. Count the pairs:\n1. Good Relationships:\n Within a group, every pair is “good.” For 7 people, the number of pairs is “7 choose 2” = 7×6/2 = 21.\n Since there are 2 groups, the total good pairs = 21 + 21 = 42.\n\n2.

Next, we see “C and G have a bad relationship.” Since C is in Group A and the rule says that if a person in one group (good with A) is bad with someone, then that someone must be bad with everyone in that group, it follows that G cannot be in Group A.\n\n3.

From the list we can group as follows:\n\n• Group 1 (involving C): {A, C, E, O, P}  \n  (C is declared good with A, E, O, and P, making these five all in one group.)\n\n• Group 2 (involving F): {B, D, F, J, L, M}  \n  (F is declared good with L, D, J, B, and M.)\n\n• Group 3 (involving K): {G, H, I, K, N}  \n  (K is declared good with H, G, I, and N.)\n\nStep 2.

Additionally, if any person in one group is bad with any person in another group, then all cross‐group relationships are bad.\n\nWe are given 18 pieces of relationship information among 16 people labeled A to P. Let’s go through them and use the rules to determine the groups.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 1. Grouping Based on A’s Relationships\n\nThe statements directly involving A:\n• “A and C have a good relationship.”\n• “A and K have a good relationship.”\n• “A and H have a good relationship.”\n• “A and E have a good relationship.”\n• “A and D have a good relationship.”\n• “A and O have a good relationship.”\n• “A and N have a good relationship.”\n• “A and F have a bad relationship.”\n\nThus A is in a group with C, K, H, E, D, O, and N. Call this Group 1:\n  Group 1 = {A, C, K, H, E, D, O, N}\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 2. Using Other Relationships Involving L\n\nExamine relationships involving L:\n• “L and M have a good relationship.” → So L, M are together.\n• “C and L have a bad relationship.” Since C is in Group 1, L cannot be in Group 1.\n• “L and B have a good relationship.” → Add B to L’s group.\n• “L and J have a bad relationship.” → J must be in a different group from L.\n• “L and F have a good relationship.” → Add F to L’s group.\n• “L and G have a good relationship.” → Add G to L’s group.\n\nThus we form Group 2:\n  Group 2 = {L, M, B, F, G}\n\nNote: “A and F have a bad relationship” fits because F is not in Group 1.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 3. Forming the Group Involving J\n\nNow consider:\n• “J and I have a good relationship.” → J and I join together.\n• “J and P have a good relationship.” → Add P to their group.\nAlso, we already had “L and J have a bad relationship,” confirming that J’s group is separate from L’s Group 2.\nIn addition, “B and I have a bad relationship” (B is in Group 2) so I cannot join Group 2.\nAnd “C and J have a bad relationship” (C is in Group 1) so J’s group is separate from Group 1.\n\nThus we form Group 3:\n  Group 3 = {J, I, P}\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 4. Verify Completeness\n\nWe have 16 people (A–P). Let’s list them by group:\n• Group 1: A, C, K, H, E, D, O, N  (8 people)\n• Group 2: L, M, B, F, G       (5 people)\n• Group 3: J, I, P        (3 people)\n\nTotal = 8 + 5 + 3 = 16 people.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 5. Counting Good and Bad Pairs\n\nEvery pair within the same group has a good relationship. For groups of sizes n, good pairs are n(n–1)/2.\n\nCalculate:\n• Group 1 (8 people): 8×7/2 = 28 good pairs.\n• Group 2 (5 people): 5×4/2 = 10 good pairs.\n• Group 3 (3 people): 3×2/2 = 3 good pairs.\n\nTotal good pairs = 28 + 10 + 3 = 41.\n\nSince there are C(16,2) = 16×15/2 = 120 distinct pairs overall, the remaining pairs are bad.\nThus, bad pairs = 120 – 41 = 79.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer\n\nFinal Answer: 41 pairs have good relationships, 79 pairs have bad relationships."

Bad relationships occur between people in different groups, and the rules mandate that if one member of one group is bad with one member of another, then all cross-group relationships are bad.\n\nAnalyzing the statements:\n\n• Statements (3), (9), (10), (11), (13), and (18) link C with F, B, A, P, G, and H respectively. Thus we form Group 1: {C, F, B, A, P, G, H}.\n\n• Statements (4), (15), and (17) link J with N, D, and O respectively.

So Group 3 is: {K, E, I, L, M}.\n\nThe remaining statements involving bad relationships (such as (2), (7), (12), (14), (16)) tell us that people across these groups are not in a good relationship.

The total number of good pairs is the sum of ⎛n⎞\n           (n choose 2) for each group:\n • Group 1: 7 choose 2 = 21 pairs\n • Group 2: 4 choose 2 = 6 pairs\n • Group 3: 5 choose 2 = 10 pairs\nSumming these gives 21 + 6 + 10 = 37 good pairs.\n\nSince any pair of people from different groups have a bad relationship, we can compute the bad pairs by subtracting the good pairs from the total pairs in 16 people.\n Total pairs for 16 people = 16 choose 2 = 120.\nThus, bad pairs = 120 − 37 = 83 pairs.\n\nFinal Answer: 37 pairs have good relationships, 83 pairs have bad relationships."

We call this Group 1:\n\n  Group 1 = {C, L, E, O, B}\n\nNext:\n\n• “G and H have a good relationship.”\n• “G and D have a good relationship.”\n• “G and F have a good relationship.”\n• “G and I have a good relationship.”\n\nThus G, H, D, F, and I are all directly or transitively good with one another. This is Group 2:\n\n  Group 2 = {G, H, D, F, I}\n\nThen:\n\n• “J and M have a good relationship.”\n• “J and K have a good relationship.”\n\nSo J, M, and K form a group. This is Group 3:\n\n  Group 3 = {J, M, K}\n\nFinally:\n\n• “N and A have a good relationship.”\n\nThis tells us that N and A are friends, forming a pair (a group with 2 members). Call this Group 4:\n\n  Group 4 = {N, A}\n\nNow we have:\n– Group 1 (size 5): {C, L, E, O, B}\n– Group 2 (size 5): {G, H, D, F, I}\n– Group 3 (size 3): {J, M, K}\n– Group 4 (size 2): {N, A}\n\nStep 2. Check the Bad Relationships & How They Separate the Groups\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe problem gives several “bad” relationships that always occur between people in different groups. For example:\n\n• “N and G have a bad relationship” → N (Group 4) is bad with G (Group 2).\n• “G and J have a bad relationship” → Group 2 is bad with Group 3.\n• “N and C have a bad relationship” → Group 4 is bad with Group 1.\n• “A and G have a bad relationship” → Again, Group 4 with Group 2.\n• “I and J have a bad relationship” → Group 2 with Group 3.\n• “N and J have a bad relationship” → Group 4 with Group 3.\n• “C and J have a bad relationship” → Group 1 with Group 3.\n• “C and G have a bad relationship” → Group 1 with Group 2.\n\nSince we have at least one explicitly given bad relationship between each pair of groups (or one link that “spreads” the bad feeling via the rules), the rules dictate that all members of one group have a bad relationship with all members of another group.\n\nThus, any pair from two different groups is in a bad relationship.\n\nStep 3. Count the Good Pairs\n-----------------------------\nWithin each group, every pair of distinct members shares a good relationship. The number of pairs within a group of size n is n(n – 1)/2.\n\n• Group 1 (size 5): 5 × 4 / 2 = 10 pairs\n• Group 2 (size 5): 10 pairs\n• Group 3 (size 3): 3 × 2 / 2 = 3 pairs\n• Group 4 (size 2): 2 × 1 / 2 = 1 pair\n\nTotal good pairs = 10 + 10 + 3 + 1 = 24\n\nStep 4. Count the Bad Pairs\n-----------------------------\nSince there are 15 people in total, the total number of pairs is 15 choose 2 = 105.\nEach pair that is not in the same group is in a bad relationship.\n\nWe already counted 24 good pairs. Thus, the number of bad pairs is:\n\n  105 – 24 = 81\n\nAlternatively, you can count bad pairs by summing over inter-group pairings:\n– Between Group 1 (size 5) and Group 2 (size 5): 5 × 5 = 25\n– Between Group 1 (size 5) and Group 3 (size 3): 5 × 3 = 15\n– Between Group 1 (size 5) and Group 4 (size 2): 5 × 2 = 10\n– Between Group 2 (size 5) and Group 3 (size 3): 5 × 3 = 15\n– Between Group 2 (size 5) and Group 4 (size 2): 5 × 2 = 10\n– Between Group 3 (size 3) and Group 4 (size 2): 3 × 2 = 6\nAdding these: 25 + 15 + 10 + 15 + 10 + 6 = 81\n\nStep 5. Final Answer\n-----------------------\nFinal Answer: 24 pairs have good relationships, 81 pairs have bad relationships."

Confirm using the “bad relationship” facts:\n – H and C are in a bad relationship. Since H is in Group 1 and C in Group 3, these groups must be separate.\n – H and O are bad, so Group 1 and Group 2 are separate.\n – Similarly, C and O are bad, so Group 3 and Group 2 are separate.\n – Other “bad” edges (like G and J, and F and N) are consistent with these separations.\n\nThus, every “good” relationship happens between people within the same group; and every pair of people from different groups must have a bad relationship according to the rules.\n\nStep 3.

Account for the \"bad\" relationships and check consistency:\n\n• N and C have a bad relationship  \n• K and L have a bad relationship  \n\nSince C is in Group 1 and N is in Group 2, the mutual bad relationship confirms that Group 1 and Group 2 are separate.

Counting the relationship pairs:\n\nGood relationships are those within the same group.\n\n• For Group 1 (8 people: C, D, E, M, K, J, F, I), the number of good pairs is 8 choose 2 = (8×7)/2 = 28.  \n• For Group 2 (6 people: N, G, H, L, B, A), the number of good pairs is 6 choose 2 = (6×5)/2 = 15.\n\nTotal good relationship pairs = 28 + 15 = 43.\n\nBad relationships occur between any person in Group 1 and any person in Group 2.

      "response": "We start by organizing the 16 people (A–P) into groups based on the given information and the rules. Remember:\n\n• Good relationships are transitive: if X–Y and Y–Z are good then X–Z is good.\n• The “bad” rule tells us that if an individual X is bad with Y but good with Z then Y and Z must be bad.\n• A “group” is a set of people where every pair shares a good relationship.\n• If even one bad connection exists between two groups, then every person in one group is bad with every person in the other.\n\nStep 1. List the given relations:\n\n1. K – I: bad\n2. K – C: bad\n3. I – B: good\n4. C – P: good\n5. C – O: good\n6. C – J: bad\n7. K – J: bad\n8. J – H: good\n9. I – C: bad\n10. F – K: good\n11.

B – C: bad\n\nThere is also a hidden implication from rule 2. For example, from (K – I: bad) and (F – K: good) we must have I – F: bad. (This and other similar “forced” relations help keep groups clearly separated.)\n\nStep 2. Form the groups.\n\n1. Look at K. We know F – K is good. So put K and F together.\n  • F also is good with D, N, G, E, and A.\n  • Hence, Group 1 becomes {A, D, E, F, G, K, N}.\n\n2. Next, consider I.\n  • I – B is good so we set up Group 2 = {I, B}.\n  • Note I is explicitly bad with K and C so I (and hence B) cannot join Group 1 or any group containing C.\n\n3. Now, look at C.\n  • C is good with P, O, L, and M.\n  • So, Group 3 = {C, P, O, L, M}.\n  • Also note: B – C is bad, confirming Group 3 must be separate from Group 2.\n\n4. Finally, consider J.\n  • J is good with H, making Group 4 = {J, H}.\n  • And notice I – J and K – J are bad, so Group 4 stays separate.\n\nThus, our groups are:\n\n• Group 1 (7 people): A, D, E, F, G, K, N  \n• Group 2 (2 people): I, B  \n• Group 3 (5 people): C, P, O, L, M  \n• Group 4 (2 people): J, H\n\nStep 3. Confirm inter–group bad relations.\nBecause we have explicit bad relationships between at least one member of every pair of groups (for example, K–I between Group 1 and Group 2; K–C between Groups 1 and 3; I–J between Groups 2 and 4; etc.), rule 5 forces that every cross–group pair is bad.\n\nStep 4. Count the pairs.\n\nTotal number of person–pairs in a 16–person set is 16 choose 2:\n  Total pairs = 16 × 15 / 2 = 120.\n\nGood pairs: all pairs within each group.\n\n• Group 1: 7 people → C(7, 2) = 21 pairs  \n• Group 2: 2 people → C(2, 2) = 1 pair  \n• Group 3: 5 people → C(5, 2) = 10 pairs  \n• Group 4: 2 people → C(2, 2) = 1 pair\n\nTotal good pairs = 21 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 33.\n\nSince every pair not in the same group is bad, the total number of bad pairs is:\n  Bad pairs = Total pairs − Good pairs = 120 − 33 = 87.\n\nFinal Answer: 33 pairs have good relationships, 87 pairs have bad relationships."

Use Transitivity to Form Groups\n\nBecause “good” relationships are transitive (if A is good with B and B is good with C then A is good with C) and people are in the same group if and only if they have good relationships (directly or through transitivity), we form groups based solely on “good” connections.\n\n• Group 1 from relationships with M:\n – M is good with E, F, and B so we have Group 1 = {M, E, F, B}.\n\n• Group 2 from relationships with L:\n – L is good with N, A, and I so we have Group 2 = {L, N, A, I}.\n\n• Group 3 from relationships with C and H:\n – C is directly good with H, D, and O so we have Group 3 = {C, H, D, O}.\n\n• Group 4 from relationships with J:\n – J is good with P, and also with K and G so we have Group 4 = {J, P, K, G}.\n\nAll 16 people are now placed in one of the four groups:\n Group 1: {M, E, F, B}\n Group 2: {L, N, A, I}\n Group 3: {C, H, D, O}\n Group 4: {J, P, K, G}\n\nStep 3. Confirm “Bad” Relationships and Their Effect on Group Separations\n\nSeveral bad relationship clues are given:\n• M and H are bad. (M is in Group 1 and H in Group 3.)\n• H and K are bad. (H is in Group 3 and K in Group 4.)\n• L and H are bad. (L is in Group 2 and H in Group 3.)\n• L and M are bad. (L is in Group 2 and M in Group 1.)\n• M and K are bad. (M in Group 1 and K in Group 4.)\n• G and M are bad. (G in Group 4 and M in Group 1.)\n• L and K are bad. (L in Group 2 and K in Group 4.)\n\nThe rules state that if any pair from two different groups has a bad relationship, then every person in one group is bad with every person in the other group. Notice that each of the above bad hints connects members of different groups. Thus every pair of people that are not in the same group automatically have a bad relationship.\n\nStep 4. Counting the Pairs\n\n1. Count “Good” Relationship Pairs (Within Each Group)\n\nWithin a group of n people, there are n(n – 1)/2 pairs, all of which are good. Each group here has 4 people, so each gives 4×3/2 = 6 pairs.\n Total good pairs = 4 groups × 6 pairs each = 24 good pairs.\n\n2. Count “Bad” Relationship Pairs (Between Different Groups)\n\nThe total number of pairs among 16 people is C(16, 2) = 120. Since every pair is either good (if in the same group) or bad (if in different groups), the number of bad pairs is:\n Bad pairs = Total pairs – Good pairs = 120 – 24 = 96.\n\nFinal Answer: 24 pairs have good relationships, 96 pairs have bad relationships."

Let’s use the transitive rule and the definitions provided to form groups where every pair within a group has a good relationship:\n\nStep 1. Forming Groups Based on Good Relationships:\n• From statements 4, 5, 7, 9, 12, 13, and 14, we see that A is directly connected with O, G, J, B, F, H, and C.

Hence, they all come together in another group.\n  Group 2 = {K, D, E, I, L, M, N}    (7 people)\n\nStep 2. Confirming Group Separation:\nThe rule tells us that if someone in one group has a bad relationship with someone in another group, then every person in one group must have a bad relationship with every person in the other group. We have:\n• Statement 1: C (from Group 1) and K (from Group 2) have a bad relationship.\n• Statement 2: H (Group 1) and M (Group 2) have a bad relationship.\nThus, the two groups are completely separate: every pair with one person from Group 1 and one person from Group 2 has a bad relationship.\n\nStep 3. Counting Relationships:\nWithin each group, every pair has a good relationship.\n• In Group 1 (8 people), the number of good relationship pairs = Combination of 8 taken 2 = 8 × 7 / 2 = 28.\n• In Group 2 (7 people), the number of good relationship pairs = Combination of 7 taken 2 = 7 × 6 / 2 = 21.\nTotal good pairs = 28 + 21 = 49.\n\nFor bad relationships, every pair consisting of one person from Group 1 (8 people) and one person from Group 2 (7 people) has a bad relationship.\nTotal bad pairs = 8 × 7 = 56.\n\nFinal Answer: 49 pairs have good relationships, 56 pairs have bad relationships."

Check “Bad” Relationships for Consistency\n\n• H and C are noted to have a bad relationship.

Confirm “bad” relationships enforce separation between groups.\n\nThe “bad” relationships provided are:\n – J and L (J in Group 3; L in Group 4)\n – H and L (H in Group 1; L in Group 4)\n – J and H (J in Group 3; H in Group 1)\n – E and L (E in Group 1; L in Group 4)\n – K and L (K in Group 2; L in Group 4)\n – K and H (K in Group 2; H in Group 1)\n – K and J (K in Group 2; J in Group 3)\n – B and K (B in Group 3; K in Group 2)\n\nEach “bad” pair is between individuals of different groups. By the given rule that “if someone from one group has a bad relationship with someone from another group then everyone from the first group has a bad relationship with everyone from the second group,” every pair of people from different groups is “bad.”\n\nStep 3. Count the pairs.\n\nWithin each group “good” pair count is the number of ways to choose 2 people from that group:\n Group 1 (5 people): C(5, 2) = 10\n Group 2 (6 people): C(6, 2) = 15\n Group 3 (3 people): C(3, 2) = 3\n Group 4 (2 people): C(2, 2) = 1\n\nTotal “good” pairs = 10 + 15 + 3 + 1 = 29.\n\nThe total number of unordered pairs from 16 people is C(16, 2) = 120.\nSince every two people either have a “good” relationship (if in the same group) or a “bad” relationship (if in different groups), the number of “bad” pairs is:\n 120 (total pairs) – 29 (good pairs) = 91.\n\nFinal Answer: 29 pairs have good relationships, 91 pairs have bad relationships."

Good relationships are transitive. (If A is good with B and B is good with C, then A is good with C.)\n2. If A has a bad relationship with B but a good relationship with C, then B and C must have a bad relationship.\n3. A “group” is a set of people all mutually connected by good relationships (directly or transitively). Moreover, different groups are completely separate, so every pair taken one from each group must have a bad relationship.\n\nStep 1. Identify the Groups Using Good Relationships\n\nFrom the given good relationships, we notice two clusters:\n\n• Group 1 (centered on K): K is good with M, A, D, E, and J. By transitivity, these five and K all share mutual good relationships. So Group 1 = {A, D, E, J, K, M}.\n\n• Group 2 (centered on B): B is good with N, G, F, L, H, I, C, and O. Hence Group 2 = {B, C, F, G, H, I, L, N, O}.\n\nStep 2. Confirm Relationships Between Groups\n\nWe have an explicit bad relationship K–C (with K from Group 1 and C from Group 2). Also, using the rule “if A (from Group 1) is bad with someone in Group 2 and A is good with every member of Group 1, then all members of Group 1 must be bad with that member from Group 2,” it follows that every person in Group 1 is in a bad relationship with every person in Group 2. The provided bad relationship E–N (E from Group 1, N from Group 2) also confirms this.\n\nStep 3. Count the Pairs\n\nWithin each group, every pair has a good relationship. Between groups, every pair has a bad relationship.\n\n• Good Relationship Pairs:\n Group 1 has 6 people, so the number of pairs = 6 choose 2 = 15.\n Group 2 has 9 people, so the number of pairs = 9 choose 2 = 36.\n Total good pairs = 15 + 36 = 51.\n\n• Bad Relationship Pairs:\n Each person in Group 1 (6 people) is in a bad relationship with every person in Group 2 (9 people).\n Total bad pairs = 6 × 9 = 54.\n\nThe total number of pairs among 15 people is 15 choose 2 = 105, and indeed 51 (good) + 54 (bad) = 105.\n\nFinal Answer: 51 pairs have good relationships, 54 pairs have bad relationships."

Identify the groups using transitivity for good relationships.\n\n– Start with person A.  \nA has good relationships with I, N, E, B, O, D, H, M, and G.  \nThus, group A (the “main group”) is: {A, I, N, E, B, O, D, H, M, G}.\n\n– Next, look at C.  \nC has good relationships with K, L, F, and J.  \nSo, group C is: {C, K, L, F, J}.\n\nStep 2. Check any conflicts using the “bad” rule.  \nWe are told N and C have a bad relationship. Since A and N are in group A, by the rule “if person X has a good relationship with someone and that someone has a bad relationship with Y then X must share a bad relationship with Y,” every member of group A must have a bad relationship with every member of group C.  \nThis is confirmed by the given “K and M are bad” since K is in group C and M in group A.  \n\nThus, the two groups are completely separate:\n• Group A = 10 people  \n• Group C = 5 people\n\nStep 3. Count the pairs based on these groups.\n\n– Good relationships occur inside each group.  \nNumber of good pairs within group A = Combination(10, 2) = 10×9/2 = 45  \nNumber of good pairs within group C = Combination(5, 2) = 5×4/2 = 10  \nTotal good pairs = 45 + 10 = 55\n\n– Bad relationships occur between every member of group A and every member of group C.  \nTotal bad pairs = 10 (from Group A) × 5 (from Group C) = 50\n\nFor completeness, note that the total number of pairs among 15 people is Combination(15,2) = 105, and indeed 55 (good) + 50 (bad) = 105.\n\nFinal Answer: 55 pairs have good relationships, 50 pairs have bad relationships"

Identify the Groups\n\nUsing the given information, we form groups as follows:\n\n• Statement 2: “E and I have a good relationship.”  \n• Statement 5: “E and L have a good relationship.”  \n• Statement 7: “E and B have a good relationship.”  \n• Statement 11: “E and M have a good relationship.”  \n• Statement 17: “E and O have a good relationship.”  \n\nThus, one group (“E group”) is: {E, I, L, B, M, O}.\n\n• Statement 4: “C and D have a good relationship.”  \n• Statement 9: “C and N have a good relationship.”  \n• Statement 13: “C and H have a good relationship.”  \n• Statement 15: “C and F have a good relationship.”  \n• Statement 18: “C and A have a good relationship.”  \n\nThis forms another group (“C group”): {C, D, N, H, F, A}.\n\n• Statement 6: “J and P have a good relationship.”  \n• Statement 14: “J and K have a good relationship.”  \n• Statement 16: “J and G have a good relationship.”  \n\nThis gives us the third group (“J group”): {J, P, K, G}.\n\nStep 2. Confirming Separation of Groups\n\nThe remaining statements confirm the separations (for example, “C and E have a bad relationship” shows E and C cannot be in the same group, “E and J have a bad relationship” and “C and J have a bad relationship” confirm that J group is separate). All 16 individuals have now been assigned:\n E group: 6 people {E, I, L, B, M, O}\n C group: 6 people {C, D, N, H, F, A}\n J group: 4 people {J, P, K, G}\n\nStep 3. Counting the Pairs\n\n• Good relationships are exactly the pairs within each group.\n For the group of 6, the number of pairs is \"6 choose 2\" = 15 pairs.\n Thus, E group: 15 pairs and C group: 15 pairs.\n For the group of 4, the number of pairs is \"4 choose 2\" = 6 pairs.\n Total good pairs = 15 + 15 + 6 = 36.\n\n• Bad relationships occur when the two people are in different groups.\n The total number of pairs among 16 people is “16 choose 2” = 120.\n Bad pairs = Total pairs − Good pairs = 120 − 36 = 84.\n\nFinal Answer: 36 pairs have good relationships, 84 pairs have bad relationships."

Also, if any one cross‐group pair is “bad,” then every member of one group is “bad” toward every member of the other.\n\nLooking at the good relationships and then the bad ones that force separations, we build the groups:\n\n• Group 1: K is good with P.  \n  So Group 1 = {K, P}.\n\n• Group 2: L is good with A, E, and M (L–A, L–E, L–M).  \n  Thus Group 2 = {L, A, E, M}.  \n  (Notice: Although “K and M” is explicitly bad, this forces Group 2 to be separate from the group that contains K.)\n\n• Group 3: O is good with B, N, and C (O–B, O–N, O–C).  \n  Thus Group 3 = {O, B, N, C}.  \n  (Also, “L and O” is bad so Group 3 is separate from Group 2; and “O and K” is bad, separating from Group 1.)\n\n• Group 4: F appears as a hub for good relationships (F–I, F–D, F–G, F–H, F–J).  \n  Thus Group 4 = {F, I, D, G, H, J}.  \n  (Additional explicit bad relations such as “L and G” and “G and K” confirm that Group 4 is separate from Groups 1 and 2.

The rules then imply that every person in one group has a bad relationship with every person in the other group.\n\nStep 4.

Identify Direct Good Relationships\n\nThe given good relationships are:\n• F–N\n• L–C\n• K–M\n• K–J\n• F–O\n• F–I\n• K–E\n• L–A\n• K–P\n• F–G\n• F–D\n• F–H\n• L–B\n\nStep 2. Group Formation via Transitivity\n\nLet’s connect the people:\n\n• Starting with F we see that F is directly good with N, O, I, G, D, and H. So one group (call it Group 1) contains: {F, N, O, I, G, D, H}.\n\n• Next, consider the good links from L. We have L–C, L–A, and L–B. So form Group 2: {L, C, A, B}.\n\n• Finally, look at K’s good partners: K–M, K–J, K–E, and K–P. Thus Group 3 is: {K, M, J, E, P}.\n\nStep 3. Check Against the Bad Relationships\n\nThe given bad relationships are:\n• L–K (implies that Group 2 and Group 3 must all be mutually bad)\n• A–N (A is in Group 2 and N in Group 1; hence Group 1 and Group 2 are completely bad)\n• G–K (G is in Group 1 and K in Group 3; hence Group 1 and Group 3 are completely bad)\n• L–G (again, Group 2 vs. Group 1 are bad)\n• F–P (F is in Group 1 and P in Group 3; reaffirming Group 1 vs. Group 3 are bad)\n\nSo by the rule “Groups are completely separate” every pair of people from different groups must have a bad relationship.\n\nStep 4. Count the Good Relationship Pairs (Within Groups Only)\n\nWithin a group every pair has a good relationship.

If someone (say A) has a bad relationship with B but a good relationship with C (with A, B, C being distinct people), then B and C must have a bad relationship.\n3. A group is defined so that every two people within it have a good relationship (directly or by transitivity), and people in one group have bad relationships with everyone in the other group.\n\nLet’s list the given good and bad relationships:\n\nGood Relationships:\n• A–P  \n• A–O  \n• A–C  \n• A–B  \n• A–I  \n• A–L  \n• A–M  \n• A–D  \n• A–K  \n• N–H  \n• N–E  \n• N–F  \n• N–J  \n• N–G\n\nBad Relationships:\n• H–I  \n• C–N\n\nNotice the following:\n• Person A is directly connected by good relationships to P, O, C, B, I, L, M, D, and K.

Also, H and I have a bad relationship while I is in Group A and H is in Group N.\n\nNow, let’s count the number of good and bad relationship pairs.\n\nStep 1.

The number of such pairs is:\n\n• Bad pairs = (Number in Group A) × (Number in Group N)  \n  = 10 × 6 = 60\n\nThus, based strictly on the provided information and the rules, the final answer is:\n\nFinal Answer: 60 pairs have good relationships, 60 pairs have bad relationships."

Identify Contradictions and Separate Groups\n• Statement (17) tells us A and C have a bad relationship. So A and C must be in different groups.\n• Similarly, statement (9) (L and C are bad) shows L and C must be in separate groups.\n• Also, statement (7) (I and J are bad) means I and J belong to different groups.\n• And statement (2) (A and L are bad) tells us A and L are not in the same group.\n• In addition, statement (13) tells us B and H are bad, so B and H must be in different groups.\n\nStep 2. Form the “Good” Groups Using the Good Relationships\n\nGroup 1 (centered on A):\n• From (3), (4), (14), (15): A is good with G, J, D, and O.\n• So Group 1 = {A, D, G, J, O}.\n\nGroup 2 (centered on C):\n• From (1), (5), (6), (8), (11): C is good with F, I, K, H, and E.\n• So Group 2 = {C, E, F, H, I, K}.\n• Note: I is in Group 2, and statement (7) (I and J are bad) is consistent since J is in Group 1.\n\nGroup 3 (centered on L):\n• From (10), (12), and (16): L is good with M, N, and B.\n• So Group 3 = {L, M, N, B}.\n• Statement (13) (B and H are bad) is also consistent, as B is in Group 3 and H is in Group 2.\n\nStep 3. Verify Consistency with All Given Information\n• A vs. L (Group 1 vs. Group 3): bad (statements 2 and rule).\n• A vs. C (Group 1 vs. Group 2): bad (statement 17).\n• I vs. J (Group 2 vs. Group 1): bad (statement 7).\n• L vs. C (Group 3 vs. Group 2): bad (statement 9).\n• B vs. H (Group 3 vs. Group 2): bad (statement 13).\n\nAll remaining given “good” relationships are internal to the groups defined above.\n\nStep 4. Count “Good” Pairs (Within Groups)\n• Group 1 has 5 people. Number of pairs = 5 choose 2 = (5×4)/2 = 10.\n• Group 2 has 6 people. Number of pairs = 6 choose 2 = (6×5)/2 = 15.\n• Group 3 has 4 people. Number of pairs = 4 choose 2 = (4×3)/2 = 6.\n• Total good pairs = 10 + 15 + 6 = 31.\n\nStep 5. Count “Bad” Pairs (Between Groups)\nSince every person from one group has a bad relationship with every person from any other group:\n• Between Group 1 (5 people) and Group 2 (6 people): 5×6 = 30.\n• Between Group 1 (5 people) and Group 3 (4 people): 5×4 = 20.\n• Between Group 2 (6 people) and Group 3 (4 people): 6×4 = 24.\n• Total bad pairs = 30 + 20 + 24 = 74.\n\nCheck: Total pairs among 15 people = (15×14)/2 = 105. And 31 + 74 = 105, which confirms the count.\n\nFinal Answer: 31 pairs have good relationships, 74 pairs have bad relationships."

Check Consistency with the “Bad” Relationships\n\n– We have “N and C are bad.” Since N is in Group 2 and C is in Group 1, this indicates that the two groups are completely separate and that every person in Group 1 has a bad relationship with every person in Group 2.  \n– We also see “I and M are bad.” I is in Group 2 and M is in Group 1.

Form groups based on “good” relationships and their transitivity.\n• Notice that C is directly connected (with good relationships) to M, G, K, E, L, D, and J. By transitivity, all these people must have good relationships with one another. So, one group (Group 1) is:\n  Group 1 = {C, M, G, K, E, L, D, J}\n\n• Next, notice that N is directly connected by good relationships to B, A, F, H, O, and I. So, Group 2 is:\n  Group 2 = {N, B, A, F, H, O, I}\n\nStep 3. Verify separation between groups:\n• The information “N and C have a bad relationship” tells us that Group 1 and Group 2 cannot merge (everyone in one group must have a bad relationship with everyone in the other group).\n• Also, “A and G have a bad relationship” confirms that A (Group 2) and G (Group 1) belong to separate groups.\n\nStep 4. Count total people:\n• People labeled from A to O are 15 in all.\n• Group 1 has 8 people.\n• Group 2 has 7 people.\n Thus, all 15 people are partitioned into these two groups.\n\nStep 5.

Call this Group 1 = {O, A, B, F}.\n\n• Next, clues “K and I have a good relationship”, “K and D have a good relationship”, “K and P have a good relationship”, and “K and M have a good relationship” put K together with I, D, P, and M. We call this Group 2 = {K, I, D, P, M}.\n\n• Clues “L and E have a good relationship”, “L and H have a good relationship”, and “L and G have a good relationship” lead to Group 3 = {L, E, H, G}.\n\n• Lastly, “J and N have a good relationship” and “J and C have a good relationship” give Group 4 = {J, N, C}.\n\nStep 2. Confirm the groups are separate.\nSeveral provided bad relationships show members from different groups are not in a good relationship:\n – F (Group 1) and J (Group 4) have a bad relationship.\n – O (Group 1) and K (Group 2) have a bad relationship.\n – O (Group 1) and L (Group 3) have a bad relationship.\n – J (Group 4) and K (Group 2) have a bad relationship.\n – D (Group 2) and L (Group 3) have a bad relationship.\n – J (Group 4) and L (Group 3) have a bad relationship.\nThese confirm that the four groups—Group 1: {O, A, B, F} (4 people), Group 2: {K, I, D, P, M} (5 people), Group 3: {L, E, H, G} (4 people), and Group 4: {J, N, C} (3 people)—are separate. By Rule 5, every person in one group has a bad relationship with every person in any other group.\n\nStep 3. Count the good pairs.\nInside a group, every pair has a good relationship. The total number of good pairs per group is given by the combination C(n, 2) where n is the group size.\n • Group 1 (4 people): C(4, 2) = 6 pairs\n • Group 2 (5 people): C(5, 2) = 10 pairs\n • Group 3 (4 people): C(4, 2) = 6 pairs\n • Group 4 (3 people): C(3, 2) = 3 pairs\nTotal good pairs = 6 + 10 + 6 + 3 = 25 pairs.\n\nStep 4. Count the bad pairs.\nA pair has a bad relationship if the two people are in different groups. Two ways to count:\n• Total pairs among 16 people = C(16, 2) = 120.\n Subtract the 25 good pairs (within groups) leaves 120 – 25 = 95 bad pairs.\n• Or sum the product of sizes for every pair of distinct groups:\n – Group 1 (4) with Group 2 (5): 4×5 = 20 pairs\n – Group 1 (4) with Group 3 (4): 4×4 = 16 pairs\n – Group 1 (4) with Group 4 (3): 4×3 = 12 pairs\n – Group 2 (5) with Group 3 (4): 5×4 = 20 pairs\n – Group 2 (5) with Group 4 (3): 5×3 = 15 pairs\n – Group 3 (4) with Group 4 (3): 4×3 = 12 pairs\n Total = 20 + 16 + 12 + 20 + 15 + 12 = 95 pairs.\n\nFinal Answer: 25 pairs have good relationships, 95 pairs have bad relationships."

So one group contains {C, H, J, N, O, G, P, M, K, D, L} (11 people).\n– E is directly connected by good relationships to A, F, B, I; adding E gives the group {E, A, F, B, I} (5 people).\n\nThe bad relationship between E and C (and also between F and N) confirms these two groups must be separate.\n\nStep 3. Count good relationship pairs\n\nWithin a group everyone shares a good relationship. Thus:\n• In the 11-person group, the number of good pairs is 11 choose 2 = (11×10)/2 = 55.\n• In the 5-person group, the number of good pairs is 5 choose 2 = (5×4)/2 = 10.\n\nTotal good relationship pairs = 55 + 10 = 65.\n\nStep 4. Count bad relationship pairs\n\nSince the groups are completely separate and any person in one group has a bad relationship with every person in the other group, the number of bad pairs is the product of the sizes of the groups:\n• 11 × 5 = 55.\n\nThus, based solely on the given information and the rules:\n\nFinal Answer: 65 pairs have good relationships, 55 pairs have bad relationships."

Build the Groups\n\n• Start with N’s relationships:\n  - From “N and J”, “N and A”, “N and M”, “N and F”, “N and O”, and “N and G”, we form Group 1:\n    → Group 1 = {N, J, A, M, F, O, G} (7 people)\n\n• Next, look at B’s relationships:\n  - “B and I”, “B and L”, “B and H”, “B and E”, “B and C”, “B and D”, “B and K” form Group 2:\n    → Group 2 = {B, I, L, H, E, C, D, K} (8 people)\n\nThe bad relationship “L and M have a bad relationship” tells us that L (from Group 2) and M (from Group 1) are in separate groups. This is consistent with the already-formed groups. The additional mention “N and C have a bad relationship” further confirms that Group 1 and Group 2 are separate.\n\nStep 2. Count Pairs for Good and Bad Relationships\n\n• Good relationships:\n  By definition, everyone in the same group has a good relationship with each other.\n\n  - In Group 1 (7 people), the number of good pairs is “7 choose 2”:  \n    Pairs = 7 × 6 / 2 = 21  \n  - In Group 2 (8 people), the number of good pairs is “8 choose 2”:  \n    Pairs = 8 × 7 / 2 = 28  \n\n  Total good relationship pairs = 21 + 28 = 49 pairs\n\n• Bad relationships:\n  Every person in one group has a bad relationship with every person in the other group.\n\n  Number of bad pairs = (Size of Group 1) × (Size of Group 2) = 7 × 8 = 56 pairs\n\nFinal Answer: 49 pairs have good relationships, 56 pairs have bad relationships"

According to the rules, any two people are either in a good relationship if they are in the same “group” (with good-transitive connections) or in a bad relationship if they belong to different groups. Let’s analyze the provided information step by step.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 1. Determine the Groups Using Good Relationships\n\n• Information that connects people positively:\n  3. C and H have a good relationship ⟹ C and H are in the same group.\n  5. C and A have a good relationship ⟹ A joins C’s group.\n  8. C and N have a good relationship ⟹ N joins C’s group.\n  10. C and G have a good relationship ⟹ G joins C’s group.\n  12. C and F have a good relationship ⟹ F joins C’s group.\n\n  So one group (Group 1) becomes: {A, C, H, N, G, F}.\n\n• Next, consider:\n  6. K and D have a good relationship ⟹ K and D are in a group.\n  13. K and P have a good relationship ⟹ P joins K’s group.\n  14. K and J have a good relationship ⟹ J joins K’s group.\n  17. K and L have a good relationship ⟹ L joins K’s group.\n\n  This defines another group (Group 2): {K, D, P, J, L}.\n\n• Next:\n  9. E and B have a good relationship ⟹ E and B in same group.\n  11. E and I have a good relationship ⟹ I joins with E and B.\n  15. E and O have a good relationship ⟹ O joins them.\n  16. E and M have a good relationship ⟹ M joins them.\n\n  Forming Group 3: {E, B, I, O, M}.\n\nThese three groups now include all 16 people:\n  Group 1 has 6 people.\n  Group 2 has 5 people.\n  Group 3 has 5 people.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 2. Confirm Group Separations with Bad Relationships\n\nThe bad relationships given are:\n  1. C and K have a bad relationship: Since C is in Group 1 and K is in Group 2, all persons in Group 1 must have a bad relationship with all in Group 2.\n  2. A and M have a bad relationship: A (Group 1) and M (Group 3) are separated.\n  4. E and K have a bad relationship: E (Group 3) and K (Group 2) confirm Group 2 and Group 3 are separate.\n  7. A and D have a bad relationship: A (Group 1) and D (Group 2) again confirm the split.\n  18. C and E have a bad relationship: C (Group 1) and E (Group 3) again confirm Group 1 and Group 3 are separate.\n\nThus all intra–group relationships are good (by transitivity) and every person from one group has a bad relationship with everyone in the other groups.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 3. Count the Pairs\n\nTotal number of pairs among 16 people is C(16, 2) = 120.\n\n• Good pairs occur only within each group.\n  - For Group 1 (6 people): C(6, 2) = 15 pairs.\n  - For Group 2 (5 people): C(5, 2) = 10 pairs.\n  - For Group 3 (5 people): C(5, 2) = 10 pairs.\n  Total good pairs = 15 + 10 + 10 = 35.\n\n• Bad pairs occur between groups.\n  - Between Group 1 (6) and Group 2 (5): 6 × 5 = 30 pairs.\n  - Between Group 1 (6) and Group 3 (5): 6 × 5 = 30 pairs.\n  - Between Group 2 (5) and Group 3 (5): 5 × 5 = 25 pairs.\n  Total bad pairs = 30 + 30 + 25 = 85.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer:\n\nFinal Answer: 35 pairs have good relationships, 85 pairs have bad relationships."

At the same time, a single known bad relationship between individuals of two different groups forces every member of one group to have a bad relationship with every member of the other group.\n\nLet's sort the people into groups:\n\nStep 1.

Look at the relationships involving C:\n• C is directly good with N (11), B (12), H (13), F (14), and D (16).  \nThus, Group 2: {C, N, B, H, F, D}.\n\nStep 3. Look at the relationships involving J:\n• J is directly good with E (3) and G (4).  \nThus, Group 3: {J, E, G}.\n\nNow check the bad relationships to confirm our grouping:\n• K and C are directly bad (15) so Group 1 and Group 2 are separate.\n• K and J are bad (9) so Group 1 and Group 3 are separate.\n• C and J are bad (2) so Group 2 and Group 3 are separate.\n• A and H are bad (10) which is consistent with A ∈ Group 1 and H ∈ Group 2.\n• G and I are bad (5) which fits with G ∈ Group 3 and I ∈ Group 1.\n\nThus, the groups are:\n• Group 1: {K, L, I, M, A} (5 people)\n• Group 2: {C, N, B, H, F, D} (6 people)\n• Group 3: {J, E, G} (3 people)\n\nGood Relationships:\nWithin each group, every pair shares a good relationship by definition.\n\n• Group 1 pairs: C(5, 2) = 10 pairs  \n• Group 2 pairs: C(6, 2) = 15 pairs  \n• Group 3 pairs: C(3, 2) = 3 pairs  \n\nTotal good pairs = 10 + 15 + 3 = 28 pairs\n\nBad Relationships:\nEvery person in one group has a bad relationship with every person in a different group.\n\nCalculate the bad pairs between groups:\n• Between Group 1 (5 people) and Group 2 (6 people): 5 × 6 = 30 pairs  \n• Between Group 1 (5 people) and Group 3 (3 people): 5 × 3 = 15 pairs  \n• Between Group 2 (6 people) and Group 3 (3 people): 6 × 3 = 18 pairs  \n\nTotal bad pairs = 30 + 15 + 18 = 63 pairs\n\nThus, the overall count among the 14 individuals (with a total of C(14, 2) = 91 pairs) is:\n• 28 good pairs  \n• 63 bad pairs\n\nFinal Answer: 28 pairs have good relationships, 63 pairs have bad relationships."

Two people are in the same group if—and only if—they are (directly or indirectly) connected by good relationships. In contrast, a single known “bad” relationship between a member of one group and a member of another “forces” everyone in one group to be bad with everyone in the other.\n\nStep 1. Identify the groups from the given information.\n\nThe good relationships explicitly given are:\n• H–L, H–O, H–I, H–B, H–P \n  ⇒ These connect H, L, O, I, B, P into one group.\n• K–J, K–A, K–G, K–F, K–N \n  ⇒ These connect K, J, A, G, F, N into a second group.\n• C–M, C–D, C–E \n  ⇒ These connect C, M, D, E into a third group.\n\nThus, we have three groups:\n Group 1: {H, L, O, I, B, P} (size = 6)\n Group 2: {K, J, A, G, F, N} (size = 6)\n Group 3: {C, M, D, E}    (size = 4)\n\nStep 2. Confirm cross–group (bad) relationships.\n\nThe explicitly given bad relationships are:\n1. K and H (K is in Group 2; H in Group 1)\n2. K and E (K in Group 2; E in Group 3)\n3. A and P (A in Group 2; P in Group 1)\n4. H and E (H in Group 1; E in Group 3)\n5. D and N (D in Group 3; N in Group 2)\n\nBy the “complete separation” rule, once one bad pair is found between two groups, every person in one is bad with every person in the other.\n\nThus:\n• Every member of Group 1 and Group 2 are in a bad relationship.\n• Every member of Group 1 and Group 3 are in a bad relationship.\n• Every member of Group 2 and Group 3 are in a bad relationship.\n\nWithin each group, since every connection is chained by good relationships, every pair has a good relationship.\n\nStep 3. Count the pairs.\n\nTotal number of pairs overall (from 16 people) is C(16, 2) = 120.\n\nGood pairs (all intra-group pairs):\n• Group 1: C(6, 2) = 15\n• Group 2: C(6, 2) = 15\n• Group 3: C(4, 2) = 6\nTotal good pairs = 15 + 15 + 6 = 36\n\nBad pairs (all inter–group pairs):\nSince all 120 pairs minus the 36 good pairs are bad:\nTotal bad pairs = 120 − 36 = 84\n\nFinal Answer: 36 pairs have good relationships, 84 pairs have bad relationships."

Check the remaining relationship information:\n• H and P have a bad relationship. This fits the picture as H is in Group 2 and P is in Group 1.\n• K and C have a bad relationship.

Count the pairs.\n• Within each group, every pair has a good relationship. \n  – Group 1 has 8 people, so the number of good pairs within Group 1 is C(8,2) = 8×7⁄2 = 28.\n  – Group 2 also has 8 people, so similarly C(8,2) = 28.\n  – Total good pairs = 28 + 28 = 56.\n\n• Between groups, every pair has a bad relationship.\n  – There are 8 people in Group 1 and 8 in Group 2.

Group formation (recalling that within a group everyone must be good with everyone else):\n• Since B is good with H, E, C, N, J, G, K, D, and L, these 10 people (B, H, E, C, N, J, G, K, D, L) must belong to the same group.\n• M is good with F, I, and A so these four (M, F, I, A) form another group.\n\nStep 3. Incorporate the bad-relationship clues:\n• M and C have a bad relationship; since C is in B’s group, M (and by transitivity, everyone good with M) must be in a different group.\n• L and M have a bad relationship; since L is in B’s group, this further confirms that the group containing M (with A, F, I) must be separate from B’s group.\n\nThus, we have two groups:\n Group 1 (10 people): B, H, E, C, N, J, G, K, D, L\n Group 2 (4 people): M, F, I, A\n\nAccording to the rules, every pair within the same group has a good relationship.

Form groups (each group’s members all have good relationships with one another by transitivity):\n\n– From “L and J” and “L and C”: Group 1 becomes {L, J, C}.\n– From “F and H”, “F and N”, “F and B”, “F and P”, and “F and D”: Group 2 becomes {F, H, N, B, P, D}.\n– From “K and M”, “K and A”, “K and O”, “K and I”: Group 3 becomes {K, M, A, O, I}.\n– From “E and G”: Group 4 becomes {E, G}.\n\n(Every person A–P appears in one of these groups.)\n\nStep 3.

K and M are good.\n  • This connects K, B, N, and M → Group1 = {K, B, N, M}.\n\n4. L and G are good.\n5. L and I are good.\n6. L and A are good.\n  • This connects L, G, I, and A → Group2 = {L, G, I, A}.\n\n7. C and F are good.\n8. C and H are good.\n9. C and E are good.\n  • This connects C, F, H, and E → Group3 = {C, F, H, E}.\n\n10. J and D are good.\n  • This makes Group4 = {J, D}.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nStep 2. Check the “bad” clues and see that they force separation between these groups.\n\nBad relationship clues:\n• E and J are bad → Person E (Group3) is bad with person J (Group4).\n• F and N are bad → F (Group3) is bad with N (Group1).\n• L and K are bad → L (Group2) is bad with K (Group1).\n• D and G are bad → D (Group4) is bad with G (Group2).\n• K and J are bad → K (Group1) is bad with J (Group4).\n• L and J are bad → L (Group2) is bad with J (Group4).\n• L and E are bad → L (Group2) is bad with E (Group3).\n• K and E are bad → K (Group1) is bad with E (Group3).\n\nBecause at least one bad relationship exists between any two persons from distinct groups, all inter-group pairs are bad. For example, since L (in Group2) is bad with K (in Group1), every member in Group2 is bad with every member in Group1. The same applies to all the other inter-group combinations.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nStep 3. Summarize into Groups\n\nWe have four groups:\n• Group1: {K, B, N, M}  (size = 4)\n• Group2: {L, G, I, A}  (size = 4)\n• Group3: {C, F, H, E}  (size = 4)\n• Group4: {J, D}     (size = 2)\n\nWithin each group, every pair is good. Across groups, every pair is bad.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nStep 4. Count the Good Relationship Pairs\n\nWithin a group of n members, the number of pairs is given by “n choose 2”.\n• Group1: 4 choose 2 = 6 pairs\n• Group2: 4 choose 2 = 6 pairs\n• Group3: 4 choose 2 = 6 pairs\n• Group4: 2 choose 2 = 1 pair\n\nTotal good pairs = 6 + 6 + 6 + 1 = 19 pairs\n\n───────────────────────────── \nStep 5. Count the Bad Relationship Pairs\n\nTotal number of pairs overall among 14 people = 14 choose 2 = 91.\nSince every pair that is not a “good” pair (within the same group) is a “bad” pair between groups:\n\nTotal bad pairs = 91 – 19 = 72 pairs\n\n───────────────────────────── \nFinal Answer:\nFinal Answer: 19 pairs have good relationships, 72 pairs have bad relationships"

The rules tell us that a “good” relationship is transitive (if A–B and B–C are good then A–C is good) and that if any two people in different groups share even one “bad” relationship then every person in one group has a bad relationship with every person in the other group. We will use these rules to “group” the people.\n\nStep 1. List the Direct Relationships\n\nGood relationships:\n• N and E are good.\n• N and L are good.\n• N and D are good.\n• N and I are good.\n• N and B are good.\n• C and J are good.\n• C and A are good.\n• C and G are good.\n• C and K are good.\n• M and H are good.\n• M and F are good.\n\nBad relationships:\n• C and M are bad.\n• N and M are bad.\n• D and F are bad.\n• C and N are bad.\n• J and L are bad.\n\nStep 2. Building the Groups\n\nThe idea is to combine people connected by “good” relationships and separate those that are separated by “bad” relationships (and their transitive consequences).\n\nLook at person N:\n– N is directly good with E, L, D, I, and B.\nThus one group (call it Group N) is: {N, E, L, D, I, B}.\n\nNow look at person C:\n– C is directly good with J, A, G, and K.\nSo a second group (Group C) is: {C, J, A, G, K}.\n\nNow consider person M:\n– M is directly good with H and F.\n– But note: M has been stated to be bad with N (and N is in Group N) and also C is bad with M (and C is in Group C). \nTherefore, M (together with F and H) cannot join Group N or Group C. Thus we form a third group (Group M): {M, F, H}.\n\nStep 3. Confirming Bad Relationships Among Groups\n\nSome of the direct bad relationships are:\n• C and M are bad → Group C and Group M are separate.\n• N and M are bad → Group N and Group M are separate.\n• C and N are bad (and similarly J and L bad, with J in Group C and L in Group N) → Group C and Group N are separate.\n\nAccording to rule 5, once one pair between two groups is bad, every person in one group is bad with every person in the other group.\n\nStep 4. Counting “Good” Relationship Pairs\n\nWithin a group, every pair has a good relationship. Count the pairs within each group:\n• Group C (members: A, C, G, J, K): Number of pairs = 5C2 = 10.\n• Group N (members: N, E, L, D, I, B): Number of pairs = 6C2 = 15.\n• Group M (members: M, F, H): Number of pairs = 3C2 = 3.\nTotal good pairs = 10 + 15 + 3 = 28.\n\nStep 5. Counting “Bad” Relationship Pairs\n\nThere are a total of 14 people giving 14C2 = 91 distinct pairs. Since all pairs not in the same group are “bad” (because we have determined that the groups are completely separate), the total bad pairs are:\nTotal pairs − Good pairs = 91 − 28 = 63.\n\nFinal Answer: 28 pairs have good relationships, 63 pairs have bad relationships."

J ~ N  \n18. K – J  \n19. D – J  \n20. F – O\n\nStep 2. Form groups using the transitivity rule for good relationships. Any pair connected directly or through a chain by good relationships belongs to the same “group.”\n\n• From (1), (7), (9), (15): E is good with A, L, P, and I.  \n → Group 1 becomes {A, E, L, P, I}.\n\n• From (3), (11), (17): J is good with O, H, and N.  \n → Group 2 becomes {J, O, H, N}.\n\n• From (4), (5), (6), (13): G is good with B, M, F, and D.  \n → Group 3 becomes {G, B, M, F, D}.\n\n• From (16): K is good with C.  \n → Group 4 becomes {K, C}.\n\nStep 3. Check consistency with bad relationship rules. Notice:\n– Statement (10): E – D. Since E is in Group 1 and D is in Group 3, this forces every person in Group 1 to have a bad relationship with every person in Group 3.\n– Similarly, (12): E – J implies Group 1 and Group 2 are separate.\n– Other statements like (2), (8), (14), (18), (19), and (20) ensure that the remaining groups have bad relationships with one another.\nAccording to rule 5, if one pair across groups is bad, then every pair from those two groups is bad.\n\nStep 4. Count pairs for each type of relationship.\n\nGood Relationships:\nWithin a group every pair has a good relationship. For a group of n people, there are n(n–1)/2 pairs.\n\n• Group 1 (size 5): 5×4/2 = 10 pairs  \n• Group 2 (size 4): 4×3/2 = 6 pairs  \n• Group 3 (size 5): 5×4/2 = 10 pairs  \n• Group 4 (size 2): 2×1/2 = 1 pair\n\nTotal good pairs = 10 + 6 + 10 + 1 = 27.\n\nBad Relationships:\nThere are 16 people overall, so the total number of pairs is 16×15/2 = 120. Since every pair is either good or bad, the number of bad pairs equals the total pairs minus the good pairs.\n\nTotal bad pairs = 120 - 27 = 93.\n\nThus, applying the transitivity rules and the separation of groups, we have:\n\nFinal Answer: 27 pairs have good relationships, 93 pairs have bad relationships."

      "response": "We start with the 16 people labeled A–P, and the relationships (keeping in mind that “good” and “bad” relationships are symmetric). The key rules are that “good” is transitive (so anyone connected by a chain of “good” is in the same group) and that if someone has a “bad” relationship with another and also a “good” relationship with a third, then the second and third must be “bad” to each other. Also, by the problem’s definition, everyone in one group (where all members have good relationships with each other) must have a bad relationship with everyone in the other group.\n\nLet’s list the relationships given:\n\n1. C – I: good  \n2. A – H: good  \n3. C – J: good  \n4. A – K: good  \n5. C – L: good  \n6. A – E: good  \n7. A – G: good  \n8. A – P: good  \n9. N – P: bad  \n10. C – F: good  \n11. A – B: good  \n12. C – D: good  \n13. C – O: good  \n14. C – N: good  \n15. K – C: bad  \n16. A – M: good\n\nNotice now the potential conflict:  \n• Line 4 states A and K have a good relationship.  \n• Line 15 states K and C have a bad relationship.\n\nBecause of the transitivity of “good” relationships, if A is good with K and (if it were true) K were good with C, then A and C would be in the same group. However, line 15 tells us that K and C are bad with each other. Now we use the second rule: If someone (call them X) is in a bad relationship with Y and X is in a good relationship with Z then Y and Z must have a bad relationship.  \n\nApply that with X = K, Y = C, and Z = A (since K is good with A):  \n• Because K – C is bad and K – A is good, it follows that A and C must have a bad relationship.  \n\nThis immediately splits the people into two groups that have internal “good” relationships and external “bad” relationships:\n\nGroup 1 (around A):  \nFrom the “good” relationships given with A, we include:  \n• A (of course)  \n• H (line 2)  \n• K (line 4)  \n• E (line 6)  \n• G (line 7)  \n• P (line 8)  \n• B (line 11)  \n• M (line 16)  \n\nThus Group 1 = {A, B, E, G, H, K, M, P}.\n\nGroup 2 (around C):  \nFrom the “good” relationships given with C, we include:  \n• C  \n• I (line 1)  \n• J (line 3)  \n• L (line 5)  \n• F (line 10)  \n• D (line 12)  \n• O (line 13)  \n• N (line 14)  \n\nThus Group 2 = {C, D, F, I, J, L, N, O}.\n\nDouble-check:  \n• The given bad relationship N – P (line 9) is consistent since N is in Group 2 and P is in Group 1.  \n• The rule we applied (from K, A, and C) shows that A and C (hence everyone in A’s group versus everyone in C’s group) must be in a “bad” relationship.\n\nWithin a group, every pair of people has a good relationship by definition.  \nBetween groups, everyone has a bad relationship.\n\nNow, count the pairs.\n\nStep 1. Count good pairs inside each group.  \n• In Group 1 there are 8 people. The number of pairs is given by 8 choose 2 = (8 × 7) / 2 = 28.  \n• In Group 2 there are also 8 people. That gives another 28 pairs.\n\nTotal “good” pairs = 28 + 28 = 56.\n\nStep 2. Count “bad” pairs (between groups).  \nThere are 8 people in Group 1 and 8 people in Group 2. Every person in Group 1 is in a bad relationship with every person in Group 2, so the number of “bad” pairs is 8 × 8 = 64.\n\nDouble-checking using the total pairs among 16 people:  \nTotal pairs = 16 choose 2 = 120.  \nAnd indeed, 56 (good) + 64 (bad) = 120.\n\nFinal Answer: 56 pairs have good relationships, 64 pairs have bad relationships."

Use “bad” information & rules to ensure groups are separated.\n\n• It is given that C has a bad relationship with K, with G, and with I. Since C ∈ Group 1, this puts K in a separate group and (G, I) in a different group than C.\n• Also, G and K are bad.\n• G and I are already in Group 3 (with F), distinct from Group 1.\n• In addition, N and O are bad. With N in Group 1 and O in Group 2, the groups stay apart.\n\nThus we have exactly three groups:\n Group 1: {A, B, C, J, N}  (5 people)\n Group 2: {K, H, P, E, O}  (5 people)\n Group 3: {F, D, M, I, L, G} (6 people)\n\nStep 3.

Count the Pairs.\n\nGood Relationships (within groups):\n• Group1: Number of pairs = C(6,2) = 15\n• Group2: Number of pairs = C(6,2) = 15\n• Group3: Number of pairs = C(4,2) = 6\nTotal good pairs = 15 + 15 + 6 = 36\n\nBad Relationships (between groups):\nBetween any two distinct groups, every person in one group is bad with every person in the other.\n• Between Group1 and Group2: 6 × 6 = 36 pairs\n• Between Group1 and Group3: 6 × 4 = 24 pairs\n• Between Group2 and Group3: 6 × 4 = 24 pairs\nTotal bad pairs = 36 + 24 + 24 = 84\n\nThus, the overall total pairs among 16 people are 36 (good) + 84 (bad) = 120, which is C(16,2).\n\nFinal Answer: 36 pairs have good relationships, 84 pairs have bad relationships."

Forming Groups Using Good Relationship Transitivity\n\nBecause a good relationship is transitive, any chain of good relationships puts people in the same “group.” From the given info we have:\n\nGroup 1 (centered on A): {A, G, L, K, E, M, C, B}  \nGroup 2 (centered on F): {F, D, I, N, O, H, J}\n\nThere is no direct good relation linking someone from Group 1 to someone in Group 2.\n\nStep 2. Confirming Separation with Bad Relationships\n\nRule (5) tells us that if at least one pair (here, C and N, as well as M and N) is in a bad relationship, then every person in one group has a bad relationship with every person in the other group. Thus, all pairs with one member from Group 1 and the other from Group 2 are bad.\n\nStep 3. Counting the Pairs\n\n• Good relationships occur among all pairs within each group.  \n  – Group 1 has 8 people so the number of pairs inside it is 8 choose 2 = 28.  \n  – Group 2 has 7 people so the number of pairs inside it is 7 choose 2 = 21.  \n  • Total good pairs = 28 + 21 = 49.\n\n• Bad relationships occur between any person in Group 1 and any person in Group 2.  \n  – That gives 8 × 7 = 56 pairs with bad relationships.\n\nFinal Answer: 49 pairs have good relationships, 56 pairs have bad relationships."

Gather the given good-relationship pairs:\n • A is good with N, E, F, G, J, and K. So A’s group (Group A) becomes {A, N, E, F, G, J, K}.\n • B is good with L, H, M, C, D, and I. So B’s group (Group B) becomes {B, L, H, M, C, D, I}.\n\nStep 2. Look at the bad relationships:\n • It is given that F and M have a bad relationship. Notice that F is in Group A and M is in Group B.\n • It is given that K and C have a bad relationship. Here K belongs to Group A and C belongs to Group B.\nSince the rules state that if one person in Group A is bad with one in Group B, then every person in one group is bad with every person in the other group, we have two groups:\n Group A = {A, N, E, F, G, J, K} and Group B = {B, L, H, M, C, D, I}.\n\nStep 3. Count the pairs:\n • Good relationships: Within each group every person is good with every other person.\n  – In a group of 7, the number of pairs is 7 choose 2, which is (7×6)/2 = 21.\n  – Therefore, total good pairs = 21 (from Group A) + 21 (from Group B) = 42.\n • Bad relationships: Every pair formed by one person from Group A and one person from Group B is bad.\n  – The number of cross-group pairs is 7 × 7 = 49.\n\nFinal Answer: 42 pairs have good relationships, 49 pairs have bad relationships."

Identify groups from good relationships.\n\nA “group” is defined as a set in which every pair (directly or through transitivity) has a good relationship. Notice that many “good” links involve A and many involve C. Examine the links:\n\n• From A we know A is good with I, H, F, M, N, E, and K. (That gives us: A, I, H, F, M, N, E, K.)\n\n• From C we know C is good with L, B, D, G, and J. (That gives us: C, L, B, D, G, J.)\n\nSo tentatively, we have two groups:\n Group 1 = {A, I, H, F, M, N, E, K}  \n Group 2 = {C, L, B, D, G, J}\n\nStep 2. Check consistency with the “bad” relationships.\n\n• It is given that K and C have a bad relationship. Here K is in Group 1 while C is in Group 2.  \n• It is given that F and G have a bad relationship. Here F is in Group 1 and G is in Group 2.\n\nThe second transitivity rule tells us that if one person is bad with someone and is good with another, then the “other” must also be bad with that someone. In our situation, once it is clear that any person in Group 1 must be bad with any person in Group 2, the groups remain completely separate.\n\nThere are no other people—to account for all 14, note that Group 1 has 8 people and Group 2 has 6 people:\n Group 1: A, I, H, F, M, N, E, K  (size = 8)  \n Group 2: C, L, B, D, G, J    (size = 6)\n\nStep 3. Count the pairs.\n\nGood relationship pairs occur only within each group (since in a group every pair is good by definition).\n\n• In Group 1, the number of good pairs = 8 choose 2 = (8×7)/2 = 28  \n• In Group 2, the number of good pairs = 6 choose 2 = (6×5)/2 = 15  \n• Total good pairs = 28 + 15 = 43\n\nBad relationship pairs occur between groups. Each person in Group 1 has a bad relationship with each person in Group 2.\n\n• Number of bad pairs = 8 × 6 = 48\n\nAdditionally, note that the sum of all pairs among 14 people is 14 choose 2 = 91, and indeed 43 + 48 = 91.\n\nFinal Answer: 43 pairs have good relationships, 48 pairs have bad relationships"

      "response": "We start by “building” the groups using transitivity of good relationships and then use the bad‐relationship information to separate groups.\n\nStep 1. List the given information:\n• C and I are good.\n• L and K are good.\n• N and E are good.\n• C and G are good.\n• J and N are bad.\n• C and L are bad.\n• N and P are good.\n• C and H are good.\n• N and O are good.\n• K and O are bad.\n• C and F are good.\n• N and C are bad.\n• J and C are bad.\n• N and L are bad.\n• L and M are good.\n• N and D are good.\n• N and B are good.\n• E and F are bad.\n• J and L are bad.\n• J and A are good.\n\nStep 2. Form groups from good relationships (remember: good is transitive, so “friends of friends” join the same group):\n\n• Begin with “C and I are good.” Place C and I in Group 1.\n • “C and G are good” → add G to Group 1.\n • “C and H are good” → add H to Group 1.\n • “C and F are good” → add F to Group 1.\nSo Group 1 = {C, I, G, H, F}.\n\n• “L and K are good.” Form Group 2 = {L, K}.\n • “L and M are good” → add M: Group 2 = {L, K, M}.\n\n• “N and E are good.” Form Group 3 = {N, E}.\n • “N and P are good” → add P: Group 3 = {N, E, P}.\n • “N and O are good” → add O: Group 3 = {N, E, P, O}.\n • “N and D are good” → add D: Group 3 = {N, E, P, O, D}.\n • “N and B are good” → add B: Group 3 = {N, E, P, O, D, B}.\n\n• “J and A are good.” Form Group 4 = {J, A}.\n\nStep 3. Use the bad relationships to verify the groups are distinct:\n• “C and L are bad” means Group 1 and Group 2 must be separate.\n• “N and C are bad” places Group 3 separate from Group 1.\n• “J and N are bad,” “J and C are bad,” “J and L are bad” ensure Group 4 is separate from Groups 1, 2, and 3.\n• “K and O are bad” confirms Groups 2 and 3 are separate.\n• “E and F are bad” again shows Group 3 is not with Group 1.\n\nThus, the groups are:\n\n– Group 1: {C, I, G, H, F} (5 people)\n– Group 2: {L, K, M} (3 people)\n– Group 3: {N, E, P, O, D, B} (6 people)\n– Group 4: {J, A} (2 people)\n\nStep 4. Counting pairs:\n\nGood pairs are exactly those within the same group.\n• In Group 1, the number of pairs is 5 choose 2 = 10.\n• In Group 2: 3 choose 2 = 3.\n• In Group 3: 6 choose 2 = 15.\n• In Group 4: 2 choose 2 = 1.\nTotal good pairs = 10 + 3 + 15 + 1 = 29.\n\nBad relationships apply between any two people in different groups (because rule 5 tells us that if even one pair across groups is bad – and we have seen several – then every pair from one group to the other is bad). The total number of pairs among 16 people is 16 choose 2 = 120.\nSubtracting the 29 good pairs gives 120 – 29 = 91 bad pairs.\n\nFinal Answer: 29 pairs have good relationships, 91 pairs have bad relationships."

      "response": "We start with the set of 14 people (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N) and the following explicit relationship statements:\n\n 1. K and G are good.  \n 2.

C and F are good.  \n 18. M and I are good.\n\nWe also have two transitivity rules:  \n• Good is transitive: If X is good with Y and Y is good with Z, then X is good with Z.  \n• Bad “propagates”: If X is bad with Y and X is good with Z, then Y and Z must be bad.\n\nA “group” is defined as a set of people who are all in good standing with each other (directly or by a chain of good relationships). Moreover, if any one member of one group has a bad relationship with someone from another group, then every member of the first group has a bad relationship with every member of the other.\n\nStep 1. Identify the clusters (groups) based on good chains:\n\nGroup 1 (centered on K):  \n • Given “K and G” (statement 1), “K and L” (4), “K and J” (5), and “K and N” (6) and using transitivity of “good,” we see that these five people form a group.  \n  Group 1 = {K, G, L, J, N}.\n\nGroup 2 (centered on M):  \n • From “M and B are good” (13), “M and H are good” (15) and “M and I are good” (18) they form a group. Transitivity gives that B, H, and I are good with one another.  \n  Group 2 = {M, B, H, I}.\n\nGroup 3 (around C):  \n • “C and E are good” (16) and “C and F are good” (17) imply (by transitivity) that E and F are good with each other.  \n  Group 3 = {C, E, F}.\n\nGroup 4:  \n • “A and D are good” (7) yields the group  \n  Group 4 = {A, D}.\n\nStep 2. Check consistency with bad relationships\n\nMany explicit bad pairs are given; for example, “A and K” (9) tells us that A (Group 4) must be separate from K (Group 1). Similarly, statements such as “H and K are bad” (2), “E and K are bad” (3), “C and L are bad” (8), “D and L are bad” (10), “A and H are bad” (11), “H and E are bad” (12), and “A and E are bad” (14) enforce that none of the groups merge. In fact, each bad relationship is between people in different groups.\n\nMoreover, rule 5 tells us that if one person in group X is known to be bad with one person in group Y, then every person in group X is bad with every person in group Y. Checking our groups:\n\n• Group 1 and Group 2: “H and K are bad” forces every member of Group 1 to be bad with every member of Group 2.  \n• Group 1 and Group 3: “E and K” and “C and L” force a complete bad relationship between these groups.  \n• Group 1 and Group 4: “A and K” and “D and L” force a complete bad relationship.  \n• Group 2 and Group 4: “A and H” forces intergroup bad relations.  \n• Group 2 and Group 3: “H and E” forces intergroup bad relations.  \n• Group 3 and Group 4: “A and E” forces intergroup bad relations.\n\nThus, every pair of people coming from different groups have a bad relationship.\n\nStep 3. Count the number of good and bad pairs\n\nWithin each group the relationship is good. We count the pairs by using the combination formula C(n, 2) for a group of n people.\n\n• Group 1 (5 people): C(5, 2) = 10 good pairs.  \n• Group 2 (4 people): C(4, 2) = 6 good pairs.  \n• Group 3 (3 people): C(3, 2) = 3 good pairs.  \n• Group 4 (2 people): C(2, 2) = 1 good pair.\n\nTotal good pairs = 10 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 20.\n\nThe overall number of distinct pairs among 14 people is C(14, 2) = 91. Since every pair has either a good or a bad relationship, the number of bad pairs is\n\n  91 total pairs – 20 good pairs = 71 bad pairs.\n\nFinal Answer: 20 pairs have good relationships, 71 pairs have bad relationships."
