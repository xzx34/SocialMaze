(E, A)\n2. (J, C)\n3. (H, I)\n4. (H, G)\n5. (J, F)\n6. (H, B)\n7. (E, D)\n\nTotal good pairs = 7.\n\n### Step 4: Identify Bad Relationships\nNow we will identify the bad relationships:\n1. (E, J)\n2. (E, H)\n3. (H, J)\n4. (I, J)\n5. (D, J)\n\n### Step 5: Apply Transitive Properties to Bad Relationships\nUsing the transitive properties:\n- Since E has a bad relationship with J and J has good relationships with C and F, E must have bad relationships with C and F.\n- Since H has a bad relationship with J and J has good relationships with C and F, H must have bad relationships with C and F.\n- Since E has a bad relationship with H, and H has good relationships with I, G, and B, E must have bad relationships with I, G, and B.\n- Since H has a good relationship with I, G, and B, and has a bad relationship with J, H must have bad relationships with C and F.\n\nThus, we can summarize the bad relationships:\n1. (E, J)\n2. (E, H)\n3. (H, J)\n4. (I, J)\n5. (D, J)\n6. (E, C)\n7. (E, F)\n8. (H, C)\n9. (H, F)\n10. (H, I)\n11. (H, G)\n12.

Therefore, **C and B** must be bad (since if A has a good relationship with C and a bad relationship with B, then B and C must have a bad relationship).\n- **C and A** are good, so **A** is good with **C** but bad with **B** (transitive property).\n- **B and E** are good, so **E** is good with **B** but bad with **H** (transitive property).\n- **B and G** are good, so **G** is good with **B** but bad with **H** (transitive property).\n- **B and I** are good, so **I** is good with **B** but bad with **H** (transitive property).\n\n### Step 3: Grouping\nFrom the analysis:\n- **Group 1**: B, D, E, G, I (all good with each other)\n- **Group 2**: C, A, F, H (C is good with A, F, and H, but H is bad with B, which separates this group from Group 1)\n\n### Step 4: Count Good and Bad Pairs\n**Good Relationships:**\n- Pairs in Group 1 (B, D, E, G, I):\n  - B-D, B-E, B-G, B-I, D-E, D-G, D-I, E-G, E-I, G-I (10 pairs)\n- Pairs in Group 2 (C, A, F, H):\n  - C-A, C-F, A-F (3 pairs)\n\nTotal good pairs = 10 (Group 1) + 3 (Group 2) = 13\n\n**Bad Relationships:**\n- B and H (1 pair)\n- H and E (1 pair)\n- Since B is bad with C, and C is good with A and F, we have:\n  - C-B (1 pair)\n- Since H is bad with B, and B is good with E, G, and I, we have:\n  - H-B, H-E, H-G, H-I (4 pairs)\n\nTotal bad pairs = 1 (B-H) + 1 (H-E) + 1 (C-B) + 4 (H with B, E, G, I) = 7\n\n### Final Count\nFinal Answer: 13 pairs have good relationships, 7 pairs have bad relationships."
