      "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the groups of people who have good relationships with each other and then count the pairs of people who have good and bad relationships.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the groups based on good relationships\n\n1. **Group 1:**\n   - N has a good relationship with C and P.\n   - O has a bad relationship with N, so O cannot be in this group.\n   - A has a bad relationship with C, so A cannot be in this group.\n   - K has a bad relationship with N, so K cannot be in this group.\n   - J has a bad relationship with N, so J cannot be in this group.\n   - Therefore, Group 1: {N, C, P}\n\n2. **Group 2:**\n   - K has good relationships with L, A, M, G, D, and H.\n   - K has bad relationships with J, O, and N.\n   - Therefore, Group 2: {K, L, A, M, G, D, H}\n\n3. **Group 3:**\n   - O has good relationships with I, F, B.\n   - O has bad relationships with N, J, K.\n   - Therefore, Group 3: {O, I, F, B}\n\n4. **Group 4:**\n   - J has good relationships with E.\n   - J has bad relationships with N, K, O.\n   - Therefore, Group 4: {J, E}\n\n5. **Group 5:**\n   - A has a bad relationship with B.\n   - A is already in Group 2, so B cannot be in Group 2.\n   - B is in Group 3.\n   - Therefore, Group 5: {A} (already in Group 2)\n\n### Step 2: Count the pairs of people who have good relationships\n\n- **Group 1: {N, C, P}**\n  - Pairs: (N, C), (N, P), (C, P)\n  - Total: 3 pairs\n\n- **Group 2: {K, L, A, M, G, D, H}**\n  - Pairs: (K, L), (K, A), (K, M), (K, G), (K, D), (K, H), (L, A), (L, M), (L, G), (L, D), (L, H), (A, M), (A, G), (A, D), (A, H), (M, G), (M, D), (M, H), (G, D), (G, H), (D, H)\n  - Total: 21 pairs\n\n- **Group 3: {O, I, F, B}**\n  - Pairs: (O, I), (O, F), (O, B), (I, F), (I, B), (F, B)\n  - Total: 6 pairs\n\n- **Group 4: {J, E}**\n  - Pairs: (J, E)\n  - Total: 1 pair\n\n- **Group 5: {A}**\n  - No pairs\n\nTotal pairs with good relationships: 3 + 21 + 6 + 1 = 31 pairs\n\n### Step 3: Count the pairs of people who have bad relationships\n\n- **Between Group 1 and Group 2:**\n  - Pairs: (N, K), (N, L), (N, A), (N, M), (N, G), (N, D), (N, H), (C, K), (C, L), (C, A), (C, M), (C, G), (C, D), (C, H), (P, K), (P, L), (P, A), (P, M), (P, G), (P, D), (P, H)\n  - Total: 21 pairs\n\n- **Between Group 1 and Group 3:**\n  - Pairs: (N, O), (N, I), (N, F), (N, B), (C, O), (C, I), (C, F), (C, B), (P, O), (P, I), (P, F), (P, B)\n  - Total: 12 pairs\n\n- **Between Group 1 and Group 4:**\n  - Pairs: (N, J), (N, E), (C, J), (C, E), (P, J), (P, E)\n  - Total: 6 pairs\n\n- **Between Group 2 and Group 3:**\n  - Pairs: (K, O), (K, I), (K, F), (K, B), (L, O), (L, I), (L, F), (L, B), (A, O), (A, I), (A, F), (A, B), (M, O), (M, I), (M, F), (M, B), (G, O), (G, I), (G, F), (G, B), (D, O), (D, I), (D, F), (D, B), (H, O), (H, I), (H, F), (H, B)\n  - Total: 28 pairs\n\n- **Between Group 2 and Group 4:**\n  - Pairs: (K, J), (K, E), (L, J), (L, E), (A, J), (A, E), (M, J), (M, E), (G, J), (G, E), (D, J), (D, E), (H, J), (H, E)\n  - Total: 14 pairs\n\n- **Between Group 3 and Group 4:**\n  - Pairs: (O, J), (O, E), (I, J), (I, E), (F, J), (F, E), (B, J), (B, E)\n  - Total: 8 pairs\n\nTotal pairs with bad relationships: 21 + 12 + 6 + 28 + 14 + 8 = 89 pairs\n\n### Final Answer\nFinal Answer: 31 pairs have good relationships, 89 pairs have bad relationships."
