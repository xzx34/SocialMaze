This gives us the initial seeds for potential groups: (J, I), (D, I), (H, D), (C, E), (H, J), (H, G), (H, A), (J, B), (C, F).\n\n2. **Applying Transitivity:** We use the transitive property to expand these initial groups. For example, since (J, I) is good and (I, D) is bad, we know (J, D) is bad.\n\n3. **Separating Groups:**  Because groups are completely separate, any bad relationship between members of different groups means those groups are distinct. For example, (H, J) is bad, separating the potential groups containing H and J.\n\n4. **Final Groups:** After applying these rules and analyzing all the relationships, we arrive at three distinct groups as listed above. \n\n\n"
