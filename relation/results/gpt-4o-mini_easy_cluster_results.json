Therefore, D, E, and G are in the same group.\n5. **H and C have a bad relationship**: This indicates that H and C are in different groups.\n6. **A and C have a bad relationship**: This indicates that A and C are in different groups.\n7. **D and F have a good relationship**: Since D is in a group with E and G, F must also be in this group. So, D, E, G, and F are in the same group.\n8. **A and D have a bad relationship**: This indicates that A is in a different group from D, E, G, and F.\n9. **C and B have a good relationship**: Since C has a bad relationship with E and A, and H has a bad relationship with C, we need to analyze B's relationship with others. Since C is in a group with B, and C is in a different group from A, H, and E, B must also be in the same group as C.\n\nNow we can summarize the groups:\n- Group 1: D, E, G, F (all have good relationships with each other)\n- Group 2: A (has bad relationships with everyone in Group 1)\n- Group 3: C, B (both have good relationships with each other, but bad relationships with everyone in Group 1 and A)\n- Group 4: H (has bad relationships with everyone in Group 1 and C)\n\nThus, we have four distinct groups:\n1. {D, E, G, F}\n2. {A}\n3. {C, B}\n4. {H}\n\nFinal Answer: 4"
