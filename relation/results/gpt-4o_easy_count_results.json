The number of good relationship pairs within this group is calculated using combinations: \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n- Group 2 (C, D, E, G, I) has 5 people. The number of good relationship pairs within this group is: \\(\\binom{5}{2} = 10\\).\n\nTotal good relationships = 6 (Group 1) + 10 (Group 2) = 16.\n\n### Step 3: Count the Bad Relationships\n\n- There are 9 people in total, so the total number of possible pairs is \\(\\binom{9}{2} = 36\\).\n- Since there are 16 good relationship pairs, the remaining pairs must be bad relationships.\n\nTotal bad relationships = 36 (total pairs) - 16 (good pairs) = 20.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nFinal Answer: 16 pairs have good relationships, 20 pairs have bad relationships"
