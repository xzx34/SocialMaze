This forms group 1: {A, B, C, J, N}.\n   * Since K and O have a good relationship, and K has good relationships with H, P, and E, then O also has good relationships with H, P, and E. This forms group 2: {H, K, E, O, P}.\n   * F's good relationships with D, M, I, L, and G form group 3: {D, F, G, I, L, M}.\n\n3. **Confirm Separation:**\n\n   * Notice that there are bad relationships between members of different groups (e.g., C and G, K and C).
