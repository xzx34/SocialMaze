C and K\n\nFrom the good relationships, we can see that A has good relationships with G, H, D, B, F, and E. C has good relationships with J, I, L, M, N, and K.\n\nNow, we will analyze the relationships to find groups:\n\n- **Group 1**: A, G, H, D, B, F, E (all have good relationships with A)\n- **Group 2**: C, J, I, L, M, N, K (all have good relationships with C)\n\nNext, we need to check if there are any bad relationships that connect these groups:\n\n- F and C have a bad relationship.\n- B and K have a bad relationship.\n\nSince F is in Group 1 and C is in Group 2, this means that everyone in Group 1 (A, G, H, D, B, F, E) has a bad relationship with everyone in Group 2 (C, J, I, L, M, N, K).\n\n### Counting Good Relationships:\n- Group 1 (A, G, H, D, B, F, E) has 7 members. The number of pairs is calculated using the combination formula C(n, 2) = n(n-1)/2:\n  - C(7, 2) = 7 * 6 / 2 = 21 pairs\n\n- Group 2 (C, J, I, L, M, N, K) also has 7 members:\n  - C(7, 2) = 7 * 6 / 2 = 21 pairs\n\nTotal good pairs = 21 (Group 1) + 21 (Group 2) = 42 pairs.\n\n### Counting Bad Relationships:\n- The bad relationships are:\n  1. F and C\n  2. B and K\n\nSince F is in Group 1 and C is in Group 2, this counts as 1 bad pair. Similarly, B (Group 1) and K (Group 2) count as another bad pair.\n\nTotal bad pairs = 2 pairs.\n\n### Final Answer:\nFinal Answer: 42 pairs have good relationships, 2 pairs have bad relationships."

C and E - bad\n\n### Step 1: Identify Good Relationships\nFrom the information, we can list the direct good relationships:\n- C and H\n- C and A\n- C and N\n- C and G\n- C and F\n- E and B\n- E and I\n- E and O\n- E and M\n- K and D\n- K and P\n- K and J\n- K and L\n\n### Step 2: Apply Transitive Properties\nUsing the transitive properties, we can deduce additional good relationships:\n- Since C and A are good, and A and D are bad, we cannot extend good relationships through A to D.\n- C and K are bad, so we cannot extend good relationships through K to others.\n- However, since K has good relationships with D, P, J, and L, we can extend good relationships from K to these individuals.\n\n### Step 3: Grouping\nWe can group the individuals based on the good relationships:\n- Group 1: C, H, A, N, G, F (C is the central figure)\n- Group 2: E, B, I, O, M (E is the central figure)\n- Group 3: K, D, P, J, L (K is the central figure)\n\n### Step 4: Count Good Relationships\nNow we count the pairs within each group:\n- Group 1 (C, H, A, N, G, F): 6 people → 6 choose 2 = 15 pairs\n- Group 2 (E, B, I, O, M): 5 people → 5 choose 2 = 10 pairs\n- Group 3 (K, D, P, J, L): 5 people → 5 choose 2 = 10 pairs\n\nTotal good pairs = 15 + 10 + 10 = 35 pairs\n\n### Step 5: Count Bad Relationships\nNow we count the bad relationships:\n1. C and K\n2. A and M\n3. E and K\n4. A and D\n5. C and E\n\nAdditionally, since groups are completely separate, we can infer that:\n- All members of Group 1 (C, H, A, N, G, F) have bad relationships with all members of Group 2 (E, B, I, O, M) and Group 3 (K, D, P, J, L).\n- All members of Group 2 have bad relationships with all members of Group 3.\n\nCalculating the bad relationships:\n- Between Group 1 and Group 2: 6 * 5 = 30 pairs\n- Between Group 1 and Group 3: 6 * 5 = 30 pairs\n- Between Group 2 and Group 3: 5 * 5 = 25 pairs\n\nTotal bad pairs = 5 (direct bad relationships) + 30 + 30 + 25 = 90 pairs\n\n### Final Count\n- Total good relationships: 35 pairs\n- Total bad relationships: 90 pairs\n\n### Final Answer\nFinal Answer: 35 pairs have good relationships, 90 pairs have bad relationships"

C and N have a bad relationship.\n2. A and N have a bad relationship.\n\nSince B has a good relationship with N, and A has a bad relationship with N, by the transitive property, A must have a bad relationship with everyone in B's group (which includes B, C, D, K, G, H, A, I, M, L, E, F, J).\n\nThus, A has bad relationships with:\n- B, C, D, K, G, H, I, M, L, E, F, J (total 12 bad relationships).\n\n### Summary:\n- Total good relationships: 13 pairs\n- Total bad relationships: 12 pairs\n\nFinal Answer: 13 pairs have good relationships, 12 pairs have bad relationships."

A and N have a good relationship.\n7. A and E have a good relationship.\n8. B and D have a good relationship.\n9. A and F have a good relationship.\n10. A and G have a good relationship.\n11. B and I have a good relationship.\n12. A and J have a good relationship.\n13. A and K have a good relationship.\n14. K and C have a bad relationship.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Good Relationships\nFrom the information provided, we can list the direct good relationships:\n- B: L, H, M, C, D, I\n- A: N, E, F, G, J, K\n\n### Step 2: Apply Transitive Properties\n- Since B has good relationships with L, H, M, C, D, and I, and A has good relationships with B, we can conclude that A also has good relationships with L, H, M, C, D, and I through B.\n- A has a good relationship with K, but K has a bad relationship with C. Therefore, A does not have a good relationship with C.\n- Thus, A's good relationships are: N, E, F, G, J, L, H, M, D, I, K (but not C).\n\n### Step 3: Grouping\nNow we can group the people based on the good relationships:\n- Group 1: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N (all connected through good relationships except for C)\n- Group 2: C (since K and C have a bad relationship, C is isolated from A's group)\n\n### Step 4: Count Good and Bad Pairs\n1. **Good Relationships**:\n   - A has good relationships with 11 people (B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N).\n   - B has good relationships with 6 people (L, H, M, C, D, I).\n   - The total number of pairs can be calculated using the formula for combinations: \\( \\binom{n}{2} \\) where n is the number of people in the group.\n   - For Group 1 (A's group): 12 people (A, B, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N) = \\( \\binom{12}{2} = 66 \\) good pairs.\n   - Group 2 (C) has no good relationships with anyone else.\n\n2. **Bad Relationships**:\n   - F and M have a bad relationship.\n   - K and C have a bad relationship.\n   - Since A's group has a bad relationship with C, all pairs between A's group and C are bad.\n   - A's group has 12 members, and C is 1 member, leading to \\( 12 \\times 1 = 12 \\) bad pairs.\n   - Total bad pairs = 1 (F and M) + 1 (K and C) + 12 (A's group with C) = 14 bad pairs.\n\n### Final Count\n- Total good pairs: 66\n- Total bad pairs: 14\n\n### Final Answer\nFinal Answer: 66 pairs have good relationships, 14 pairs have bad relationships."
