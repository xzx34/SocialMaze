F is in Group 1 and H is in Group 2.\n – It’s also given that B and E have a bad relationship. B is in Group 1 and E is in Group 2.\nThe rules state that if any person from one group has a bad relationship with someone in another group, then every person in Group 1 must have a bad relationship with everyone in Group 2. Hence, all pairs formed between members of Group 1 and Group 2 have bad relationships.\n\nStep 3: Count the pairs.\n\n• Good relationships (within each group):\n – In Group 1 (4 people): The number of pairs is C(4, 2) = 6.\n – In Group 2 (4 people): The number of pairs is C(4, 2) = 6.\n – Total good pairs = 6 + 6 = 12.\n\n• Bad relationships (between groups):\n – Every person in Group 1 (4 people) is in a bad relationship with every person in Group 2 (4 people): 4 × 4 = 16 pairs.\n\nThus, among the 28 (C(8, 2)) total pairs, there are 12 pairs with good relationships and 16 pairs with bad relationships.\n\nFinal Answer: 12 pairs have good relationships, 16 pairs have bad relationships."

E and G have a bad relationship.\n\nBecause “good” is transitive, if A is good with several people then all of those people are good with one another. From the information:\n• A is directly good with B, C, D, F, and G.\n• By transitivity, all of B, C, D, F, and G are mutually good.\n\nThus, we form one group with: A, B, C, D, F, G (6 people).\n\nNow look at E and H:\n• H and E share a good relationship, so they are in a group together.\nHowever, notice:\n• Since A and C are in the first group and it is given that C and H are bad, H cannot join A’s group.\n• Similarly, E cannot be in A’s group because E and G are bad (and G is in A’s group).\n\nThus, the remaining group is: E and H (2 people).\n\nBased on the rules, every pair of people within the same group has a good relationship, and every pair taken from different groups has a bad relationship.\n\nNow, count the pairs in each case:\n\nGood Relationships:\n• In the 6‐member group there are 6 choose 2 = (6×5)/2 = 15 pairs.\n• In the 2‐member group there is 2 choose 2 = 1 pair.\n• Total good pairs = 15 + 1 = 16\n\nBad Relationships:\n• Every person in the 6‑member group has a bad relationship with every person in the 2‑member group.\n• That gives 6 × 2 = 12 pairs with bad relationships.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\nFinal Answer: 16 pairs have good relationships, 12 pairs have bad relationships."

Group Formation Based on Good Relationships\n\nFrom the info involving D:  \n– D–F, D–E, D–J, D–G, and D–I are all good, so these people belong to the same group. Thus, one group (Group 1) includes:  \n  {D, F, E, J, G, I}\n\nNext, notice the relationships involving H:  \n– H–C, H–B, and H–A are good. So they form another group (Group 2):  \n  {H, C, B, A}\n\nStep 2. Checking Cross-Group Relationships\n\nWe also have two pieces of information that connect these groups by a bad relationship:  \n• C–G is bad. (Here G is in Group 1 and C is in Group 2.)  \n• E–H is bad. (E is in Group 1 and H is in Group 2.)\n\nBy the rule given, once one member of one group has a bad relationship with a member of the other group, all pairs (one from each group) must have a bad relationship. This confirms that all relationships between Group 1 and Group 2 are bad.\n\nStep 3. Counting Pairs\n\nCount total pairs in each scenario:\n\nA. Good relationship pairs (within groups):  \n• For Group 1 (6 people): Number of pairs = 6 choose 2 = (6×5)/2 = 15  \n• For Group 2 (4 people): Number of pairs = 4 choose 2 = (4×3)/2 = 6  \nTotal good pairs = 15 + 6 = 21\n\nB. Bad relationship pairs (between groups):\n\nSince every person in Group 1 (6 people) has a bad relationship with every person in Group 2 (4 people):  \nTotal bad pairs = 6 × 4 = 24\n\nFinal Answer: 21 pairs have good relationships, 24 pairs have bad relationships"

Determine the groups from the given good relationship pairs.\n • Given: A and H (good), A and C (good), A and B (good), A and F (good). So A, H, C, B, and F are all connected by good relationships. (Any two people in this set have a direct or inferred good relation, per transitivity.)\n • Given: D and G (good), so D and G form a group.\n • Given: E and I (good), so E and I form a group.\n\nThus our groups are:\n Group 1: {A, B, C, F, H} (5 people)\n Group 2: {D, G} (2 people)\n Group 3: {E, I} (2 people)\n\nWe can check the provided bad relationships for consistency:\n • D and E are in different groups → bad.\n • C and E are in different groups → bad.\n • A and D are in different groups → bad.\n • B and I are in different groups → bad.\n • C and D are in different groups → bad.\n These all match the “different groups give a bad relationship” rule.\n\nStep 2. Count the number of good pairs.\nGood pairs are any two people within the same group:\n • Group 1: There are 5 people, so the number of pairs is 5C2 = 10.\n • Group 2: There are 2 people, so 2C2 = 1.\n • Group 3: There are 2 people, so 2C2 = 1.\nTotal good pairs = 10 + 1 + 1 = 12.\n\nStep 3. Count the number of bad pairs.\nBad pairs occur between different groups. We have three combinations of groups:\n • Between Group 1 (5 people) and Group 2 (2 people): 5 × 2 = 10 pairs.\n • Between Group 1 (5 people) and Group 3 (2 people): 5 × 2 = 10 pairs.\n • Between Group 2 (2 people) and Group 3 (2 people): 2 × 2 = 4 pairs.\nTotal bad pairs = 10 + 10 + 4 = 24.\n\nSince there are 9 people in total, the total number of pairs among all individuals is 9C2 = 36, which is consistent with 12 good pairs + 24 bad pairs = 36 pairs.\n\nFinal Answer: 12 pairs have good relationships, 24 pairs have bad relationships."

Identify Good Relationship Groups  \nUsing the transitive property for good relationships (“if A is good with B and B is good with C, then A is good with C”), we form groups where every member is connected via good relationships.\n\n– From “A and B”, “A and F”, “A and G”, and “A and H”, all persons A, B, F, G, H are in one group.

Check Bad Relationships Across Groups  \nThe additional rule states: “if A has a bad relationship with B, and A has a good relationship with C, then B and C must have a bad relationship.” Also, it is given that if one person in one group is bad with someone in another group, then every person from one group has a bad relationship with everyone in the other group. We verify with the given info:\n\n• H (Group 1) and C (Group 2) are bad → therefore every member of Group 1 is bad with every member of Group 2.  \n• H (Group 1) and I (Group 3) are bad (as well as F and I) → so every member of Group 1 is bad with every member of Group 3.  \n• C (Group 2) and I (Group 3) are bad (and E and I are bad) → so every member of Group 2 is bad with every member of Group 3.\n\nStep 3. Count the Pairs  \nTotal number of people = 9. There are two kinds of pairs: good (within the same group) and bad (across groups).\n\nGood pairs (within groups):  \n• Group 1: 5 people. Number of pairs = 5C2 = 10  \n• Group 2: 2 people. Number of pairs = 2C2 = 1  \n• Group 3: 2 people. Number of pairs = 2C2 = 1  \nTotal good pairs = 10 + 1 + 1 = 12\n\nBad pairs (across different groups):  \nCalculate cross-group pairs by multiplying the sizes and summing:  \n• Between Group 1 (5) and Group 2 (2): 5 × 2 = 10  \n• Between Group 1 (5) and Group 3 (2): 5 × 2 = 10  \n• Between Group 2 (2) and Group 3 (2): 2 × 2 = 4  \nTotal bad pairs = 10 + 10 + 4 = 24\n\nFinal Answer: 12 pairs have good relationships, 24 pairs have bad relationships."

Grouping People with Good Relationships\n\nBecause good relationships are transitive, if two people are connected by a chain of “good” ties, they belong to the same group (and within a group everyone is mutually good).\n\nFrom the information provided, we have these directly connected “good” ties:\n\n• B–E, B–J, B–F, B–H → These put B, E, J, F, and H in one group. Let’s call this Group 1.\n• A–D and A–G → These put A, D, and G in another group. Call this Group 2.\n• C–I → This makes a small group with C and I. Call this Group 3.\n\nStep 2. Checking Consistency with “Bad” Ties\n\nThe “bad” relationships provided occur between members of different groups. For instance:\n• E (Group 1) and C (Group 3) have a bad relationship.\n• A (Group 2) and C (Group 3) have a bad relationship.\n• A (Group 2) and E (Group 1) have a bad relationship.\n• F (Group 1) and G (Group 2) have a bad relationship.\n• I (Group 3) and J (Group 1) have a bad relationship.\n\nBecause of the rule “groups are completely separate – if someone from one group has a bad relationship with someone from another group, then everyone in the first group has a bad relationship with everyone in the second group,” we conclude that every person in one group has a bad relationship with every person in any other group.\n\nStep 3. Counting Good Relationships\n\nWithin groups, every pair shares a good relationship. The number of pairs in a group of n people is given by n(n–1)/2.\n\n• Group 1 (B, E, J, F, H) has 5 people → 5×4/2 = 10 pairs.  \n• Group 2 (A, D, G) has 3 people → 3×2/2 = 3 pairs.  \n• Group 3 (C, I) has 2 people → 2×1/2 = 1 pair.\n\nTotal good pairs = 10 + 3 + 1 = 14.\n\nStep 4. Counting Bad Relationships\n\nThere are a total of 10 people; the total number of pairs among them is 10×9/2 = 45. Since every pair is either “good” or “bad” (based on the provided rules), the number of bad pairs is:\n\nTotal pairs – Good pairs = 45 – 14 = 31.\n\nFinal Answer: 14 pairs have good relationships, 31 pairs have bad relationships."

      "response": "We have 8 people: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H. Given the information and the rules, we first figure out which people belong together in a “group” (meaning they all have good relationships with one another by transitivity) and then use the fact that when people are in different groups—and at least one bad relationship exists between someone in one group and someone in another—all inter‐group relationships are bad.\n\nStep 1. Identify groups using the “good” relationships and transitivity.\n\n• A and E have a good relationship.\n• A and F have a good relationship.\n• A and G have a good relationship.\nBy transitivity, E, F, and G must all be good with each other as well as with A. Thus one group is:\n  Group 1 = {A, E, F, G}\n\n• C and B have a good relationship.\nSo we have a tentative group:\n  Group 2 = {B, C}\n\n• H and D have a good relationship.\nThis gives another group:\n  Group 3 = {H, D}\n\nStep 2. Confirm groups by checking “bad” relationships.\n\nSome given bad relationships cross these tentative groups:\n • A and D are bad. (A ∈ Group 1; D ∈ Group 3) → Group 1 and Group 3 must have all cross-relationships bad.\n • A and C are bad. (A ∈ Group 1; C ∈ Group 2) → Group 1 and Group 2 must have all cross-relationships bad.\n • E and C are bad. (E ∈ Group 1; C ∈ Group 2) reinforces that Group 1 and Group 2 are separate.\n • E and H are bad. (E ∈ Group 1; H ∈ Group 3) also reinforces that Group 1 and Group 3 are separate.\n • C and H are bad. (C ∈ Group 2; H ∈ Group 3) → Group 2 and Group 3 must have all cross-relationships bad.\n\nThus, our groups are final:\n  Group 1 = {A, E, F, G}  (4 people)\n  Group 2 = {B, C}     (2 people)\n  Group 3 = {H, D}     (2 people)\n\nWithin a group every pair has a good relationship. So we count good pairs inside each group:\n\n• Group 1: Number of pairs = 4C2 = (4×3)/2 = 6 \n• Group 2: Number of pairs = 2C2 = 1\n• Group 3: Number of pairs = 2C2 = 1\n\nTotal good pairs = 6 + 1 + 1 = 8 pairs\n\nStep 3. Now, between groups, the rule tells us that if one pair (one person from one group and one from another) are known to be bad, then every such cross‐group pairing is bad. We already have bad evidence between every two groups. Thus, every pair with people from different groups is bad.\n\nNow, count the number of cross-group pairs:\n • Between Group 1 (4 people) and Group 2 (2 people): 4×2 = 8 pairs\n • Between Group 1 (4) and Group 3 (2): 4×2 = 8 pairs\n • Between Group 2 (2) and Group 3 (2): 2×2 = 4 pairs\n\nTotal bad pairs = 8 + 8 + 4 = 20 pairs\n\nVerification: There are a total of 8C2 = 28 pairs among 8 people. Our count of 8 (good) + 20 (bad) = 28 pairs, which confirms our analysis.\n\nFinal Answer: 8 pairs have good relationships, 20 pairs have bad relationships."

Identify the Good Relationship Groups\n\nUsing the transitive property of good relationships (if A is good with B and A is good with C, then B and C are good with each other), we can form groups.\n\nFrom the information:\n– A is good with E, H, B, G, and C.  \n– Thus, A, E, H, B, G, and C all belong in one group (call it Group 1).\n\nSeparately, we have F–D as a good relationship, which connects F and D (call this Group 2).\n\nStep 2. Check for Consistency with Bad Relationships\n\nThe rules imply that if someone in Group 1 has a bad relationship with someone in Group 2, then all members of Group 1 must be bad with all members of Group 2.  \n• Given C–F is bad and E–F is bad, and since C and E are in Group 1 while F is in Group 2, this forces all pairings between Group 1 and Group 2 to be bad.  \n• Thus, our grouping is consistent with the given information.\n\nGroup 1: {A, B, C, E, G, H} (6 people)  \nGroup 2: {D, F} (2 people)\n\nStep 3. Count the Pairs\n\n• Good Relationships:  \nWithin a group, every pair of individuals shares a good relationship.  \n– In Group 1, the number of pairs = 6C2 = (6×5)/2 = 15  \n– In Group 2, the number of pairs = 2C2 = 1  \nTotal good pairs = 15 + 1 = 16\n\n• Bad Relationships:  \nEvery person in Group 1 has a bad relationship with every person in Group 2.  \nNumber of such cross-group pairs = 6 × 2 = 12\n\nFinal Answer: 16 pairs have good relationships, 12 pairs have bad relationships"

Identify groups using transitive good relationships:\n\n• From “B and F”, “B and E”, “B and D”, “B and G”: we see that B, F, E, D, and G all share good relationships.

According to our rules, people in different groups have bad relationships with each other. This is consistent.\n\nStep 3. Count the number of pairs:\n\nGood relationships exist among every pair within each group.

Use transitivity for good relationships:\n\n• From A’s good relationships we see that A is directly good with B, C, D, E, F, and H. By transitivity, all these six people have a good relationship with one another. This forms a group with A.\n• Also, from J–I (good) and J–G (good), we know I, J, and G are in a group together.\n\nThus we have two groups:\n Group 1: {A, B, C, D, E, F, H} (7 people)\n Group 2: {G, I, J} (3 people)\n\nStep 3. Use the rule for bad relationships:\n\n• The rule “if A has a bad relationship with B and A has a good relationship with C then B and C must have a bad relationship” ensures that if a person in one group is bad with a person in the other group, then every member of the first group is bad with every member of the second group. \n• We already see (C, J) is bad and (D, I) is bad.

Forming Groups Based on Good Relationships\n\nRecall that a group is a maximal set of people where every pair has (directly or transitively) a good relationship.\n\n• Look at the relationships involving A. We see that A is directly good with F, B, C, and D.\n  → So one tentative group is {A, B, C, D, F}.\n\n• Now consider H. We see H has good relationships with G, I, and E.\n  → Thus another group is {H, G, I, E}.\n\nStep 2. Checking Consistency with the Bad Relationships\n\n• Notice “A and E have a bad relationship.” Since A is in group {A, B, C, D, F} and E is in group {H, G, I, E}, they must be in different groups.\n• Also “C and H have a bad relationship.” Here C belongs to group 1 and H to group 2. This agrees with our grouping.\n\nThus, our groups based on transitive (good) relationships are:\n\n• Group 1: {A, B, C, D, F} (5 people)\n• Group 2: {H, G, I, E} (4 people)\n\nStep 3. Counting Good Relationship Pairs\n\nWithin any group every pair has a good relationship. So:\n\n• For Group 1, the number of pairs is 5 choose 2 = 10.\n• For Group 2, the number of pairs is 4 choose 2 = 6.\n• Total good pairs = 10 + 6 = 16 pairs.\n\nStep 4. Counting Bad Relationship Pairs\n\nThe given rules state that if members of different groups have any bad relationship, then every member in one group has a bad relationship with every member of the other group. Since we already know (A, E) and (C, H) are bad and A and C are in group 1 while E and H are in group 2, it follows that every cross-group pair is bad.\n\n• The number of cross-group pairs is the product of the sizes of the two groups: 5 × 4 = 20 pairs.\n\nTo verify, note the total number of pairs among 9 people is 9 choose 2 = 36, and indeed 16 (good) + 20 (bad) = 36.\n\nFinal Answer: 16 pairs have good relationships, 20 pairs have bad relationships."

Forming Groups by “Good” Connections\n\nA “group” is defined as a set in which every pair of people has a good relationship (directly or by transitivity). Notice:\n\n• A is directly good with D, C, I, and E. Therefore, A, D, C, I, and E form a group (call it Group 1).\n\n• B is directly good with F, H, and G. So B, F, H, and G form another group (call it Group 2).\n\nStep 2. Checking Consistency with the “Bad” Relationship\n\nWe are given that C and H have a bad relationship. Note that C is in Group 1 while H is in Group 2. The rule “If A has a bad relationship with B, and A has a good relationship with C, then B and C must have a bad relationship” ensures that:\n – Since C (Group 1) is bad with H (Group 2) and, for example, A (also in Group 1) is good with C, then A must have a bad relationship with H.\n – Once A (in Group 1) and H (in Group 2) are bad, by the same rule every person in Group 1 (all good with A) must be bad with every person in Group 2 (all good with H).\n\nThus, Group 1 and Group 2 remain completely separate: every pair with one person from Group 1 and one from Group 2 is a bad relationship.\n\nStep 3. Counting Pairs with Good Relationships\n\nWithin each group every pair has a good relationship.\n\n• Group 1 has 5 people (A, C, D, E, I). The number of pairs is Combination(5,2) = 5×4/2 = 10.\n• Group 2 has 4 people (B, F, G, H). The number of pairs is Combination(4,2) = 4×3/2 = 6.\n\nTotal good pairs = 10 + 6 = 16.\n\nStep 4.

Thus, all pairs with one member from Group 1 and one from Group 2 are “bad” pairs.\n\nStep 3. Counting Pairs\n\nTotal number of pairs from 8 people is not needed here because the relationships are completely determined by the groups.\n\nGood Relationship Pairs (within groups):\n\n• In Group 1 with 3 people: The number of pairs = 3C2 = 3 pairs  \n• In Group 2 with 5 people: The number of pairs = 5C2 = 10 pairs\n\nTotal good pairs = 3 + 10 = 13 pairs\n\nBad Relationship Pairs (across groups):\n\nEvery person in Group 1 has a bad relationship with every person in Group 2. Thus, the number of bad pairs = (size of Group 1) × (size of Group 2) = 3 × 5 = 15 pairs\n\nFinal Answer: 13 pairs have good relationships, 15 pairs have bad relationships."

Form the “good‐relationship” groups based on transitivity:\n• From A’s good contacts we have A, D, F, C, H, and G. Since good relationships are transitive (if A is good with B and A is good with C then B and C are good with each other) these six form one group.\n• Separately, we have E and B with a good relationship, so they form a second group.\n\nStep 2. Verify consistency with the bad relationships:\n• C (in the first group) and E (in the second group) have a stated bad relationship.\n• B (in the second group) and H (in the first group) also have a stated bad relationship.\nGiven the rule that if anyone in one group is in a bad relationship with someone in the other group then every person in one group has a bad relationship with every person in the other group, the groups are completely distinct.\n\nThus, we have:\n Group 1: {A, D, F, C, H, G} (6 people)\n Group 2: {E, B} (2 people)\n\nStep 3.

Form the Groups Using “Good” Relationships:\n\nNotice that C is directly connected (good) with F, I, D, E, and H. Because good relationships are transitive, this means that F, I, D, E and H all share good relationships with one another through C. Thus, one group consists of:\n Group 1: {C, F, I, D, E, H}\n\nAlso, A is directly connected (good) with G and B. They too form a complete group:\n Group 2: {A, G, B}\n\nEvery pair within a group must have a good relationship (either directly or by transitivity).\n\nStep 2. Confirm “Bad” Relationships Between Groups:\n\nWe have a direct bad relationship between A (Group 2) and C (Group 1). According to the rules, if even one person from Group 2 has a bad relationship with someone from Group 1, then every person in Group 2 has a bad relationship with every person in Group 1. Hence, all pairs with one member in Group 1 and the other in Group 2 have bad relationships.\n\nAlso, the given bad relationship between G (Group 2) and H (Group 1) further confirms this separation.\n\nStep 3. Count the Good Relationships:\n\nCalculate the number of pairs within each group:\n\n• Group 1 has 6 people. The number of pairs is 6 choose 2 = (6×5)/2 = 15.\n• Group 2 has 3 people. The number of pairs is 3 choose 2 = (3×2)/2 = 3.\n\nTotal good pairs = 15 + 3 = 18\n\nStep 4. Count the Bad Relationships:\n\nAll cross-group pairs (one from Group 1 and one from Group 2) have bad relationships.

Confirm Bad Relationships Between Groups\n\nThe rules state that if anyone in one group has a bad relationship with anyone in another group, then every member of the first group has a bad relationship with every member of the other group. We have:\n\n• “A and I” (A ∈ Group 3; I ∈ Group 2) → Group 3 and Group 2 are in a mutual bad relationship.\n• “C and I” (C ∈ Group 1; I ∈ Group 2) and “E and G” (E ∈ Group 1; G ∈ Group 2) → Group 1 and Group 2 are in a mutual bad relationship.\n• “A and C” (A ∈ Group 3; C ∈ Group 1) → Group 3 and Group 1 are in a mutual bad relationship.\n\nThus, every pair of individuals from different groups has a bad relationship.\n\nStep 3.

Count the pairs:\n• Good pairs (within each group):\n – Group 1 (5 people): 5 choose 2 = 10 pairs  \n – Group 2 (2 people): 2 choose 2 = 1 pair  \n – Group 3 (3 people): 3 choose 2 = 3 pairs  \n Total good = 10 + 1 + 3 = 14 pairs\n\n• Total pairs among 10 people is 10 choose 2 = 45.  \nThus, the remaining pairs (45 – 14) = 31 pairs are bad (inter-group relationships).\n\nFinal Answer: 14 pairs have good relationships, 31 pairs have bad relationships."

Form groups:\n– Notice that B is good with C, G, E, and F. Thus one group (let’s call it Group 1) initially contains {B, C, G, E, F}.\n– Meanwhile, A is good with H, D, I, and J. So another group (Group 2) contains {A, H, D, I, J}.\n\nStep 3. Check the \"bad\" relationships:\n• H and C have a bad relationship. Since H is in Group 2 and C is in Group 1, the rule “groups are completely separate” applies. This means every person in Group 1 is bad with every person in Group 2.\n• Also, A and E have a bad relationship. Since A is in Group 2 and E is in Group 1, this confirms the separation between the groups.\n\nNo information contradicts these groupings, so we have exactly two groups:\n Group 1: {B, C, G, E, F}\n Group 2: {A, H, D, I, J}\n\nStep 4. Counting relationships:\n• Good relationships exist between any two people within the same group.\n – Group 1 has 5 members; the number of pairs among them is 5C2 = 10.\n – Group 2 also has 5 members; the pairs among them are 5C2 = 10.\n – Total good pairs = 10 + 10 = 20.\n\n• Bad relationships exist for any pair with one person from Group 1 and one from Group 2.\n – That number is 5 (from Group 1) × 5 (from Group 2) = 25.\n\nFinal Answer: 20 pairs have good relationships, 25 pairs have bad relationships."

C and I have a good relationship.\n\nStep 1. Group Identification\n\nRule: Good relationships are transitive. We group together people connected by a chain of good relationships.\n\n• From statements (1), (3), (5), (6), and (9), C is directly connected by good relationships with F, G, H, D, and I. By transitivity, all these individuals share good relationships with one another. Thus one group is:\n  Group 1 = {C, F, G, H, D, I}\n\n• Statements (7) and (4) indicate that E has good relationships with A and B. This forms another group:\n  Group 2 = {E, A, B}\n\nNotice that statements (2) and (8) tell us that E (or A) do not have a good relationship with C. Therefore, these groups must remain separate.\n\nStep 2. Total Good Relationships Within Each Group\n\nIn each group, every pair of people has a good relationship.\n\n• For Group 1 with 6 people: The number of pairs is 6 choose 2 = 15.\n• For Group 2 with 3 people: The number of pairs is 3 choose 2 = 3.\n\nThus, the total number of good pairs = 15 + 3 = 18.\n\nStep 3. Total Bad Relationships\n\nAll pairs not having a good relationship are bad. Since relationships are defined for every pair of the 9 people (with no neutral option), the overall number of pairs among 9 people is 9 choose 2 = 36.\n\nSubtracting the good pairs:\n  Bad pairs = 36 – 18 = 18.\n\nAlternatively, notice that the 2 groups are completely separate. Every person in Group 1 (6 people) has a bad relationship with every person in Group 2 (3 people), which is 6 × 3 = 18 bad pairs.\n\nFinal Answer: 18 pairs have good relationships, 18 pairs have bad relationships."

Identify the groups using transitivity for “good” relationships.\n\n• Notice B is good with G, H, D, I, and C. By transitivity (if one is good with a second and that second is good with a third, then the first is good with the third), these people form one set. Let’s call this Group 1:\n  Group 1 = {B, C, D, G, H, I}\n\n• Next, E is good with F, and E is also good with A. So these three form another group. Let’s call this Group 2:\n  Group 2 = {E, F, A}\n\nStep 2. Check cross–group relationships.\n\n• We have an explicit bad relationship: B and F are bad. Since B is in Group 1 and F is in Group 2, the rule “if someone from one group has a bad relationship with someone from another group, then every person in the first group is bad with every person in the second group” tells us all pairs with one person from Group 1 and the other from Group 2 must be bad.\n• Also, the explicit relation E and C being bad is consistent, since E is in Group 2 and C is in Group 1.\n\nStep 3. Count the pairs.\n\n(a) Good relationships are exactly those pairs where both people are in the same group.\n  • Group 1 has 6 members. The number of pairs is C(6,2) = 15.\n  • Group 2 has 3 members. The number of pairs is C(3,2) = 3.\n  • Total good pairs = 15 + 3 = 18.\n\n(b) Bad relationships occur between any person in Group 1 and any person in Group 2.\n  There are 6 (Group 1) × 3 (Group 2) = 18 pairs having bad relationships.\n\nFinal Answer: 18 pairs have good relationships, 18 pairs have bad relationships"

List the direct relationships:\n\n• C and H are bad.\n• H and B are good.\n• H and I are good.\n• C and A are good.\n• H and E are bad.\n• E and F are good.\n• F and H are bad.\n• H and G are good.\n• C and D are good.\n• A and G are bad.\n• C and E are bad.\n\nStep 2. Determine the groups using the transitivity of “good” relationships:\n\n• From “C and A are good” and “C and D are good,” we place C, A, and D in one group. Call it Group 1: {A, C, D}.\n• From “H and B are good,” “H and I are good,” and “H and G are good,” we form Group 2: {H, B, I, G}.\n• “E and F are good” yields Group 3: {E, F}.\n\nStep 3. Check consistency with the “bad” relationships:\n\n• “C and H are bad” places Group 1 (with C) and Group 2 (with H) in conflict, which is correct because members of different groups must have bad relationships.\n• “H and E are bad” and “F and H are bad” show Group 2 and Group 3 are in a bad relationship.\n• “A and G are bad” confirms that Group 1 and Group 2 are separate.\n• “C and E are bad” confirms that Group 1 and Group 3 are separate.\n\nThus, the final groups are:\n\n• Group 1: {A, C, D} (3 people)\n• Group 2: {H, B, I, G} (4 people)\n• Group 3: {E, F} (2 people)\n\nStep 4.

Form groups using the rule that good relationships are transitive (“if A is good with B and B is good with C, then A is good with C”) and that people are in the same group if (directly or indirectly) they have good ties.\n\n• From “C and I are good,” “C and F are good,” and “C and A are good,” we include A, C, F, I into one group.

The number of good pairs in a group of n people is nC2:\n  Group 1: 4C2 = 6 pairs\n  Group 2: 3C2 = 3 pairs\n  Group 3: 2C2 = 1 pair\n\nTotal good pairs = 6 + 3 + 1 = 10\n\nStep 4. Count the Bad Relationship Pairs\n\nRule 5 tells us that if at least one pair between two groups is bad, then all pairs between the groups are bad.\n\n• Between Group 1 (4 people) and Group 2 (3 people):\n  Bad pairs = 4 × 3 = 12\n\n• Between Group 1 (4 people) and Group 3 (2 people):\n  Bad pairs = 4 × 2 = 8\n\n• Between Group 2 (3 people) and Group 3 (2 people):\n  Bad pairs = 3 × 2 = 6\n\nTotal bad pairs = 12 + 8 + 6 = 26\n\nStep 5. Final Answer\n\nFinal Answer: 10 pairs have good relationships, 26 pairs have bad relationships"

In contrast, if even one bad relationship is reported between members of two different sets, then every person in one group has a bad relationship with every person in the other.\n\nStep 1. List the explicit relationships:\n\nGood relationships:\n• D and I\n• C and A\n• B and G\n• D and F\n• D and H\n• D and E\n\nBad relationships:\n• E and G\n• B and E\n• C and E\n• C and B\n• B and C (repeated)\n\nStep 2. Form groups from the good relationship links:\n\n• The relation D–I, D–F, D–H, and D–E connect D, I, F, H, and E. So we have one group: Group 1 = {D, I, F, H, E}.\n\n• The relation B–G yields Group 2 = {B, G}.\n\n• The relation C–A yields Group 3 = {C, A}.\n\nStep 3. Check the bad relationships to confirm group separations:\n\n• E (in Group 1) and G (in Group 2) have a bad relationship.\n• B (in Group 2) and E (in Group 1) have a bad relationship.\n• C (in Group 3) and E (in Group 1) have a bad relationship.\n• C (in Group 3) and B (in Group 2) have a bad relationship.\n\nThese bad relations confirm that the groups do not mix. By the transitivity rules, every pair within each group is connected by a good relationship, while every pair from different groups is connected by a bad relationship.\n\nStep 4. Count the good relationship pairs (i.e. pairs within each group):\n\n• Group 1: 5 members → (5 choose 2) = 10 pairs\n• Group 2: 2 members → (2 choose 2) = 1 pair\n• Group 3: 2 members → (2 choose 2) = 1 pair\n\nTotal good pairs = 10 + 1 + 1 = 12 pairs.\n\nStep 5. Count the bad relationship pairs (i.e. pairs across different groups):\n\nThe total pairs among 9 people is (9 choose 2) = 36 pairs. Since every pair is either good (inside the same group) or bad (across groups), the remaining pairs are bad.\n\nTotal bad pairs = Total pairs – Good pairs = 36 – 12 = 24 pairs.\n\nFinal Answer: 12 pairs have good relationships, 24 pairs have bad relationships."

B and C: good  \n7. H and D: good  \n8. B and F: good  \n\nStep 1. Identify groups based on “good” relationships and transitivity.\n\n• From clues 1, 2, 6, and 8, notice that B is good with G, E, C, and F. By transitivity, these five (B, G, E, C, F) all have good relationships with each other. So, Group 1 = {B, G, E, C, F}.\n\n• From clues 4 and 7, H is good with A and D. So, Group 2 = {H, A, D}.\n\nStep 2. Confirm separation by “bad” relationships.\n\n• Clue 5 shows E (Group 1) and H (Group 2) have a bad relationship.  \n• Clue 3 shows H (Group 2) and C (Group 1) have a bad relationship.  \n\nGiven the rule that if one person in a group has a bad relationship with someone in another group, then everyone in the first group has a bad relationship with everyone in the second group, we conclude that any cross-group relationship is bad.\n\nStep 3.

Check the bad relationships between individuals in different groups.\n• A (in Group 1) has a bad relationship with both G (Group 2) and H (Group 3); by the rules, everyone in Group 1 then has a bad relationship with everyone in Groups 2 and 3.  \n• E (Group 2) and G (Group 2) both are confirmed to have bad relationships with H (Group 3).  \n\nThis confirms that individuals in different groups have bad relationships.

Identify Groups Using Good Relationships\n\nNotice that several “good” relationships involve A. In fact:  \n– A is good with H, D, F, E, and C.  \nThus, by transitivity (if person X is good with Y, and Y is good with Z, then X is good with Z), A and all that connect with A belong to the same “good” group. So we form:\n\nGroup 1 = {A, H, D, F, E, C}\n\nNext, look at the remaining “good” relationships:  \n– I and G have a good relationship, and I and B have a good relationship, which puts them together. So,  \nGroup 2 = {I, G, B}\n\nStep 2. Confirm Separation with Bad Relationships\n\nThe information “C and I have a bad relationship” involves C from Group 1 and I from Group 2 and forces these groups to be completely separate (by the problem’s rules, if one person in one group is bad with someone in another group, then everyone in one group is bad with everyone in the other group). Likewise, “C and G have a bad relationship” confirms the separation.\n\nStep 3. Count the Number of Pairs with Good Relationships\n\nWithin each group everyone is in a good relationship with each other.  \n• In Group 1 (6 people): The number of pairs is C(6, 2) = (6×5)/2 = 15.  \n• In Group 2 (3 people): The number of pairs is C(3, 2) = (3×2)/2 = 3.\n\nTotal good pairs = 15 + 3 = 18 pairs.\n\nStep 4. Count the Number of Pairs with Bad Relationships\n\nSince the groups are completely separated by bad relationships, every pair consisting of one person from Group 1 and one person from Group 2 will have a bad relationship.  \n• The total number of such pairs is: 6 (from Group 1) × 3 (from Group 2) = 18 pairs.\n\nThus, the final counts are:\n\nFinal Answer: 18 pairs have good relationships, 18 pairs have bad relationships."

Check consistency with bad relationships:\n• “B and C are bad” fits since B is in the second group and C is in the first.\n• “C and F are bad” is also consistent because C is in the first group while F is in the second.\n• Also, by the rule “if A has a good relationship with C (group 1) and a good relationship with someone in the other group then that relationship must be bad (by transitivity)”, every person in group 1 is bad with every person in group 2.\n\nThus, we have two distinct groups:\n• Group 1: {A, D, C, H, E} (5 people)\n• Group 2: {B, G, F} (3 people)\n\nStep 4.

Count pairs with good relationships.\n\nWithin each group every member has a good relationship with every other:\n • Group 1 (6 people): Number of pairs = 6C2 = (6×5)/2 = 15  \n • Group 2 (4 people): Number of pairs = 4C2 = (4×3)/2 = 6  \nTotal good pairs = 15 + 6 = 21\n\nStep 4. Count pairs with bad relationships.\n\nEvery pair of people from different groups has a bad relationship. There are 6 people in Group 1 and 4 people in Group 2:\n Number of cross-group pairs = 6 × 4 = 24\n\nThus, the total pairs are 21 (good) + 24 (bad) = 45, which equals the total pairs from 10 people (10C2).\n\nFinal Answer: 21 pairs have good relationships, 24 pairs have bad relationships."

Identify Good Relationships and Form Groups:\n• From “B and G have a good relationship”, “B and I have a good relationship”, “B and H have a good relationship”, and “B and C have a good relationship”, we see that B, G, I, H, and C are directly linked (or connected via B). By using the transitivity of good relationships, they all become mutually good with one another. Let’s call this Group 1 = {B, G, I, H, C}.\n\n• From “E and A have a good relationship”, “E and F have a good relationship”, and “E and D have a good relationship”, E is directly connected to A, F, and D. By transitivity, A, F, D, and E all have good relationships with one another. Define Group 2 = {E, A, F, D}.\n\nStep 2. Check Bad Relationships and Intergroup Connection:\n• It is given that “E and C have a bad relationship”. Notice that E is in Group 2 and C is in Group 1.  \n• It is also given that “A and G have a bad relationship”, with A in Group 2 and G in Group 1.\nA rule tells us that once any person in one group has a bad relationship with a person in another group, then every member of one group has a bad relationship with every member of the other group. So all cross-group pairs are bad.\n\nStep 3. Count the Pairs:\nGood relationships exist within each group only.  \n• In Group 1 (5 people), the number of good pairs is 5 choose 2 = 10.  \n• In Group 2 (4 people), the number of good pairs is 4 choose 2 = 6.  \nTotal good pairs = 10 + 6 = 16.\n\nBad relationships exist for every pair that has one member in Group 1 and the other in Group 2. The number of such pairs is the size of Group 1 multiplied by the size of Group 2 = 5 × 4 = 20.\n\nFinal Answer: 16 pairs have good relationships, 20 pairs have bad relationships."

Notice the following:\n\n• E is in a good relationship with A, B, and D. This means that A, B, D, and E belong to one group. Let’s call this Group 1.\n  \n• C is in a good relationship with J, I, G, F, and H. This means that C, J, I, G, F, and H belong to another group. Let’s call this Group 2.\n\nThere is a conflict between the groups, as shown by:\n • E and C have a bad relationship, and\n • B and C have a bad relationship.\nSince a good tie within a group would force any bad ties with someone in another group to extend to everyone in the respective groups, all members in Group 1 have bad relationships with all members in Group 2.\n\nStep 4. Count the pairs.\n\nGood Relationships (intra‐group):\n • Group 1 has 4 people. The number of pairs in a group of n is given by n(n – 1)/2.

Check for consistency with the “bad” relationships using the extra rule:\n  “If A has a bad relationship with B, and A has a good relationship with C, then B and C must have a bad relationship.”\n- Fact (6) tells us B and E are bad. Since E is in Group 1 and B is in Group 2, this will force every person in Group 1 to be in a bad relationship with every person in Group 2.\n- Fact (3) tells us H and C are bad, which is consistent since H (in Group 1) and C (in Group 2) are in different groups.\n\nThus, our division is consistent.

When two people have a good relationship (and the relation is transitive), they are in the same group. Thus:\n\n  • From C–B, C–D, and C–I we group {B, C, D, I} together.\n  • From A–(H, F, E, G) we group {A, H, F, E, G} together.\n\n2. The rule “If A has a good relationship with C and A has a bad relationship with B, then B and C must have a bad relationship” forces disagreements between the groups. We see H (in group {A, H, F, E, G}) has a bad relationship with C (in group {B, C, D, I}), and B–F is also a cross‐group relationship. Therefore the two groups are completely separated: any person in group 1 has a bad relationship with any person in group 2.\n\nSince every pair within a group shares a good relationship and every pair from different groups has a bad relationship, we can now count:\n\nGroup 1 (A, F, H, E, G) contains 5 people.

Two people are in the same group if and only if they have a (direct or transitive) good relationship; everyone in different groups must have a bad relationship with everyone in the other group.\n\nStep 1.

Identify “good” connections (recall that good relationships are transitive):\n\n1. E and B are good, so we initially put them in a group: Group 1 = {B, E}.  \n2. I and D are good, and I and F are good, so we form Group 2 = {I, D, F}.  \n3. H is good with A, G, and C, so the third group is Group 3 = {H, A, G, C}.\n\nStep 2. Verify using the “bad” information:\n- B and I are given as bad, so B (Group 1) and I (Group 2) must be in different groups.  \n- E and F are bad, so E (Group 1) and F (Group 2) are separated.  \n- C and E; also C and F are bad, placing C (Group 3) separate from both E (Group 1) and F (Group 2).  \n- B and H are bad, so B (Group 1) and H (Group 3) must be separated.\n\nThus, the groups are consistent with all the information and how “good” relationships transitively merge people together.\n\nStep 3. Count “good” pairs within each group:\n• In Group 1 (2 people: B, E), the number of pairs = 1.  \n• In Group 2 (3 people: I, D, F), the number of pairs = 3 (since 3C2 = 3).  \n• In Group 3 (4 people: H, A, G, C), the number of pairs = 6 (4C2 = 6).\n\nTotal good pairs = 1 + 3 + 6 = 10.\n\nStep 4.

C is in {A, C, E, F} while H is in {B, D, G, H} – so they are in different groups.\n• Statement (2) (F and J), (4) (E and J), (5) (E and G), and (10) (G and J) involve members from different groups.\n \nThus the groups we have are:\n Group 1: {A, C, E, F}\n Group 2: {B, D, G, H}\n Group 3: {I, J}\n\nWithin each group everyone is in a good relationship with everyone else (by definition and transitivity). Also, because there is at least one bad relationship between one person in a group and one in another, rule 5 forces every pair from two different groups to have a bad relationship.\n\nStep 2. Count the pairs.\n\nTotal number of pairs among 10 people is 10 choose 2 = 45.\n\nGood pairs (pairs within the same group):\n• Group 1: 4 members → (4 choose 2) = 6 pairs.\n• Group 2: 4 members → (4 choose 2) = 6 pairs.\n• Group 3: 2 members → (2 choose 2) = 1 pair.\nTotal good pairs = 6 + 6 + 1 = 13.\n\nBad pairs (pairs from different groups):\nThey are the remainder, so 45 total pairs − 13 good pairs = 32 bad pairs.\nAlternatively, count cross–group pairs:\n• Between Group 1 (4 people) and Group 2 (4 people): 4×4 = 16.\n• Between Group 1 (4 people) and Group 3 (2 people): 4×2 = 8.\n• Between Group 2 (4 people) and Group 3 (2 people): 4×2 = 8.\nTotal bad pairs = 16 + 8 + 8 = 32.\n\nFinal Answer: 13 pairs have good relationships, 32 pairs have bad relationships."
