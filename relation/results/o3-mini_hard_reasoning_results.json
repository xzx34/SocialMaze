So one group is {N, E, L, D, I, B}.\n• From C: C has good relationships with J, A, G, and K. So another group is {C, J, A, G, K}.\n• From M: M has good relationships with H and F. So a third group is {M, H, F}.\n\nStep 2. Check cross-group relationships provided:\n• We have “C and N have a bad relationship.” This establishes that the group containing C (the C-group) and the group containing N (the N-group) are completely separated.\n• Similarly, “N and M have a bad relationship” and “C and M have a bad relationship” tell us that both the N-group and the C-group are each in a bad relationship with M’s group.\n\nStep 3. Answer the question:\nThe question asks if H (in the M-group) and K (in the C-group) have a good relationship. Since C and M have a bad relationship, by the rule that groups are completely separate (everyone in one has bad relationships with everyone in the other), H and K must have a bad relationship.\n\nFinal Answer: No"
