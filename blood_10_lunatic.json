Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Investigator.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nThe roles of players 1-10 are:\nFinal Player 1: [Role]\nFinal Player 2: [Role]\nFinal Player 3: [Role]\nFinal Player 4: [Role]\nFinal Player 5: [Role]\nFinal Player 6: [Role]\nFinal Player 7: [Role]\nFinal Player 8: [Role]\nFinal Player 9: [Role]\nFinal Player 10: [Role]\n\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information. Even if you're uncertain, you must provide your best guess for the criminal and each player's role. Think step-by-step to reach your judgment, and then commit to your most likely conclusion based on available information.\n"

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Criminal.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nThe roles of players 1-10 are:\nFinal Player 1: [Role]\nFinal Player 2: [Role]\nFinal Player 3: [Role]\nFinal Player 4: [Role]\nFinal Player 5: [Role]\nFinal Player 6: [Role]\nFinal Player 7: [Role]\nFinal Player 8: [Role]\nFinal Player 9: [Role]\nFinal Player 10: [Role]\n\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information. Even if you're uncertain, you must provide your best guess for the criminal and each player's role. Think step-by-step to reach your judgment, and then commit to your most likely conclusion based on available information.\n"

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Criminal.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nThe roles of players 1-10 are:\nFinal Player 1: [Role]\nFinal Player 2: [Role]\nFinal Player 3: [Role]\nFinal Player 4: [Role]\nFinal Player 5: [Role]\nFinal Player 6: [Role]\nFinal Player 7: [Role]\nFinal Player 8: [Role]\nFinal Player 9: [Role]\nFinal Player 10: [Role]\n\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information. Even if you're uncertain, you must provide your best guess for the criminal and each player's role. Think step-by-step to reach your judgment, and then commit to your most likely conclusion based on available information.\n"

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Criminal.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nThe roles of players 1-10 are:\nFinal Player 1: [Role]\nFinal Player 2: [Role]\nFinal Player 3: [Role]\nFinal Player 4: [Role]\nFinal Player 5: [Role]\nFinal Player 6: [Role]\nFinal Player 7: [Role]\nFinal Player 8: [Role]\nFinal Player 9: [Role]\nFinal Player 10: [Role]\n\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information. Even if you're uncertain, you must provide your best guess for the criminal and each player's role. Think step-by-step to reach your judgment, and then commit to your most likely conclusion based on available information.\n"

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Criminal.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nThe roles of players 1-10 are:\nFinal Player 1: [Role]\nFinal Player 2: [Role]\nFinal Player 3: [Role]\nFinal Player 4: [Role]\nFinal Player 5: [Role]\nFinal Player 6: [Role]\nFinal Player 7: [Role]\nFinal Player 8: [Role]\nFinal Player 9: [Role]\nFinal Player 10: [Role]\n\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information. Even if you're uncertain, you must provide your best guess for the criminal and each player's role. Think step-by-step to reach your judgment, and then commit to your most likely conclusion based on available information.\n"

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Criminal.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nThe roles of players 1-10 are:\nFinal Player 1: [Role]\nFinal Player 2: [Role]\nFinal Player 3: [Role]\nFinal Player 4: [Role]\nFinal Player 5: [Role]\nFinal Player 6: [Role]\nFinal Player 7: [Role]\nFinal Player 8: [Role]\nFinal Player 9: [Role]\nFinal Player 10: [Role]\n\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information. Even if you're uncertain, you must provide your best guess for the criminal and each player's role. Think step-by-step to reach your judgment, and then commit to your most likely conclusion based on available information.\n"

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Criminal.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nThe roles of players 1-10 are:\nFinal Player 1: [Role]\nFinal Player 2: [Role]\nFinal Player 3: [Role]\nFinal Player 4: [Role]\nFinal Player 5: [Role]\nFinal Player 6: [Role]\nFinal Player 7: [Role]\nFinal Player 8: [Role]\nFinal Player 9: [Role]\nFinal Player 10: [Role]\n\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information. Even if you're uncertain, you must provide your best guess for the criminal and each player's role. Think step-by-step to reach your judgment, and then commit to your most likely conclusion based on available information.\n"

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Criminal.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nThe roles of players 1-10 are:\nFinal Player 1: [Role]\nFinal Player 2: [Role]\nFinal Player 3: [Role]\nFinal Player 4: [Role]\nFinal Player 5: [Role]\nFinal Player 6: [Role]\nFinal Player 7: [Role]\nFinal Player 8: [Role]\nFinal Player 9: [Role]\nFinal Player 10: [Role]\n\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information. Even if you're uncertain, you must provide your best guess for the criminal and each player's role. Think step-by-step to reach your judgment, and then commit to your most likely conclusion based on available information.\n"

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Investigator.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nThe roles of players 1-10 are:\nFinal Player 1: [Role]\nFinal Player 2: [Role]\nFinal Player 3: [Role]\nFinal Player 4: [Role]\nFinal Player 5: [Role]\nFinal Player 6: [Role]\nFinal Player 7: [Role]\nFinal Player 8: [Role]\nFinal Player 9: [Role]\nFinal Player 10: [Role]\n\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information. Even if you're uncertain, you must provide your best guess for the criminal and each player's role. Think step-by-step to reach your judgment, and then commit to your most likely conclusion based on available information.\n"

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Criminal.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nThe roles of players 1-10 are:\nFinal Player 1: [Role]\nFinal Player 2: [Role]\nFinal Player 3: [Role]\nFinal Player 4: [Role]\nFinal Player 5: [Role]\nFinal Player 6: [Role]\nFinal Player 7: [Role]\nFinal Player 8: [Role]\nFinal Player 9: [Role]\nFinal Player 10: [Role]\n\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information. Even if you're uncertain, you must provide your best guess for the criminal and each player's role. Think step-by-step to reach your judgment, and then commit to your most likely conclusion based on available information.\n"

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Investigator.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nThe roles of players 1-10 are:\nFinal Player 1: [Role]\nFinal Player 2: [Role]\nFinal Player 3: [Role]\nFinal Player 4: [Role]\nFinal Player 5: [Role]\nFinal Player 6: [Role]\nFinal Player 7: [Role]\nFinal Player 8: [Role]\nFinal Player 9: [Role]\nFinal Player 10: [Role]\n\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information. Even if you're uncertain, you must provide your best guess for the criminal and each player's role.

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Investigator.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nThe roles of players 1-10 are:\nFinal Player 1: [Role]\nFinal Player 2: [Role]\nFinal Player 3: [Role]\nFinal Player 4: [Role]\nFinal Player 5: [Role]\nFinal Player 6: [Role]\nFinal Player 7: [Role]\nFinal Player 8: [Role]\nFinal Player 9: [Role]\nFinal Player 10: [Role]\n\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information. Even if you're uncertain, you must provide your best guess for the criminal and each player's role. Think step-by-step to reach your judgment, and then commit to your most likely conclusion based on available information.\n"

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Criminal.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nThe roles of players 1-10 are:\nFinal Player 1: [Role]\nFinal Player 2: [Role]\nFinal Player 3: [Role]\nFinal Player 4: [Role]\nFinal Player 5: [Role]\nFinal Player 6: [Role]\nFinal Player 7: [Role]\nFinal Player 8: [Role]\nFinal Player 9: [Role]\nFinal Player 10: [Role]\n\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information. Even if you're uncertain, you must provide your best guess for the criminal and each player's role. Think step-by-step to reach your judgment, and then commit to your most likely conclusion based on available information.\n"

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Criminal.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nThe roles of players 1-10 are:\nFinal Player 1: [Role]\nFinal Player 2: [Role]\nFinal Player 3: [Role]\nFinal Player 4: [Role]\nFinal Player 5: [Role]\nFinal Player 6: [Role]\nFinal Player 7: [Role]\nFinal Player 8: [Role]\nFinal Player 9: [Role]\nFinal Player 10: [Role]\n\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information. Even if you're uncertain, you must provide your best guess for the criminal and each player's role. Think step-by-step to reach your judgment, and then commit to your most likely conclusion based on available information.\n"

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Criminal.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nThe roles of players 1-10 are:\nFinal Player 1: [Role]\nFinal Player 2: [Role]\nFinal Player 3: [Role]\nFinal Player 4: [Role]\nFinal Player 5: [Role]\nFinal Player 6: [Role]\nFinal Player 7: [Role]\nFinal Player 8: [Role]\nFinal Player 9: [Role]\nFinal Player 10: [Role]\n\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information. Even if you're uncertain, you must provide your best guess for the criminal and each player's role. Think step-by-step to reach your judgment, and then commit to your most likely conclusion based on available information.\n"

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Criminal.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nThe roles of players 1-10 are:\nFinal Player 1: [Role]\nFinal Player 2: [Role]\nFinal Player 3: [Role]\nFinal Player 4: [Role]\nFinal Player 5: [Role]\nFinal Player 6: [Role]\nFinal Player 7: [Role]\nFinal Player 8: [Role]\nFinal Player 9: [Role]\nFinal Player 10: [Role]\n\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information. Even if you're uncertain, you must provide your best guess for the criminal and each player's role.

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Criminal.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nThe roles of players 1-10 are:\nFinal Player 1: [Role]\nFinal Player 2: [Role]\nFinal Player 3: [Role]\nFinal Player 4: [Role]\nFinal Player 5: [Role]\nFinal Player 6: [Role]\nFinal Player 7: [Role]\nFinal Player 8: [Role]\nFinal Player 9: [Role]\nFinal Player 10: [Role]\n\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information. Even if you're uncertain, you must provide your best guess for the criminal and each player's role. Think step-by-step to reach your judgment, and then commit to your most likely conclusion based on available information.\n"

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Investigator.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nThe roles of players 1-10 are:\nFinal Player 1: [Role]\nFinal Player 2: [Role]\nFinal Player 3: [Role]\nFinal Player 4: [Role]\nFinal Player 5: [Role]\nFinal Player 6: [Role]\nFinal Player 7: [Role]\nFinal Player 8: [Role]\nFinal Player 9: [Role]\nFinal Player 10: [Role]\n\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information. Even if you're uncertain, you must provide your best guess for the criminal and each player's role. Think step-by-step to reach your judgment, and then commit to your most likely conclusion based on available information.\n"

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Criminal.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nThe roles of players 1-10 are:\nFinal Player 1: [Role]\nFinal Player 2: [Role]\nFinal Player 3: [Role]\nFinal Player 4: [Role]\nFinal Player 5: [Role]\nFinal Player 6: [Role]\nFinal Player 7: [Role]\nFinal Player 8: [Role]\nFinal Player 9: [Role]\nFinal Player 10: [Role]\n\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information. Even if you're uncertain, you must provide your best guess for the criminal and each player's role. Think step-by-step to reach your judgment, and then commit to your most likely conclusion based on available information.\n"

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Investigator.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nThe roles of players 1-10 are:\nFinal Player 1: [Role]\nFinal Player 2: [Role]\nFinal Player 3: [Role]\nFinal Player 4: [Role]\nFinal Player 5: [Role]\nFinal Player 6: [Role]\nFinal Player 7: [Role]\nFinal Player 8: [Role]\nFinal Player 9: [Role]\nFinal Player 10: [Role]\n\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information. Even if you're uncertain, you must provide your best guess for the criminal and each player's role. Think step-by-step to reach your judgment, and then commit to your most likely conclusion based on available information.\n"

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Criminal.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nThe roles of players 1-10 are:\nFinal Player 1: [Role]\nFinal Player 2: [Role]\nFinal Player 3: [Role]\nFinal Player 4: [Role]\nFinal Player 5: [Role]\nFinal Player 6: [Role]\nFinal Player 7: [Role]\nFinal Player 8: [Role]\nFinal Player 9: [Role]\nFinal Player 10: [Role]\n\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information. Even if you're uncertain, you must provide your best guess for the criminal and each player's role.

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Criminal.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nThe roles of players 1-10 are:\nFinal Player 1: [Role]\nFinal Player 2: [Role]\nFinal Player 3: [Role]\nFinal Player 4: [Role]\nFinal Player 5: [Role]\nFinal Player 6: [Role]\nFinal Player 7: [Role]\nFinal Player 8: [Role]\nFinal Player 9: [Role]\nFinal Player 10: [Role]\n\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information. Even if you're uncertain, you must provide your best guess for the criminal and each player's role. Think step-by-step to reach your judgment, and then commit to your most likely conclusion based on available information.\n"

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Investigator.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nThe roles of players 1-10 are:\nFinal Player 1: [Role]\nFinal Player 2: [Role]\nFinal Player 3: [Role]\nFinal Player 4: [Role]\nFinal Player 5: [Role]\nFinal Player 6: [Role]\nFinal Player 7: [Role]\nFinal Player 8: [Role]\nFinal Player 9: [Role]\nFinal Player 10: [Role]\n\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information. Even if you're uncertain, you must provide your best guess for the criminal and each player's role. Think step-by-step to reach your judgment, and then commit to your most likely conclusion based on available information.\n"

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Criminal.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nThe roles of players 1-10 are:\nFinal Player 1: [Role]\nFinal Player 2: [Role]\nFinal Player 3: [Role]\nFinal Player 4: [Role]\nFinal Player 5: [Role]\nFinal Player 6: [Role]\nFinal Player 7: [Role]\nFinal Player 8: [Role]\nFinal Player 9: [Role]\nFinal Player 10: [Role]\n\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information. Even if you're uncertain, you must provide your best guess for the criminal and each player's role. Think step-by-step to reach your judgment, and then commit to your most likely conclusion based on available information.\n"

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Criminal.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nThe roles of players 1-10 are:\nFinal Player 1: [Role]\nFinal Player 2: [Role]\nFinal Player 3: [Role]\nFinal Player 4: [Role]\nFinal Player 5: [Role]\nFinal Player 6: [Role]\nFinal Player 7: [Role]\nFinal Player 8: [Role]\nFinal Player 9: [Role]\nFinal Player 10: [Role]\n\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information. Even if you're uncertain, you must provide your best guess for the criminal and each player's role. Think step-by-step to reach your judgment, and then commit to your most likely conclusion based on available information.\n"

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Investigator.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nThe roles of players 1-10 are:\nFinal Player 1: [Role]\nFinal Player 2: [Role]\nFinal Player 3: [Role]\nFinal Player 4: [Role]\nFinal Player 5: [Role]\nFinal Player 6: [Role]\nFinal Player 7: [Role]\nFinal Player 8: [Role]\nFinal Player 9: [Role]\nFinal Player 10: [Role]\n\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information. Even if you're uncertain, you must provide your best guess for the criminal and each player's role.

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Investigator.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nThe roles of players 1-10 are:\nFinal Player 1: [Role]\nFinal Player 2: [Role]\nFinal Player 3: [Role]\nFinal Player 4: [Role]\nFinal Player 5: [Role]\nFinal Player 6: [Role]\nFinal Player 7: [Role]\nFinal Player 8: [Role]\nFinal Player 9: [Role]\nFinal Player 10: [Role]\n\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information. Even if you're uncertain, you must provide your best guess for the criminal and each player's role. Think step-by-step to reach your judgment, and then commit to your most likely conclusion based on available information.\n"

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Investigator.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nThe roles of players 1-10 are:\nFinal Player 1: [Role]\nFinal Player 2: [Role]\nFinal Player 3: [Role]\nFinal Player 4: [Role]\nFinal Player 5: [Role]\nFinal Player 6: [Role]\nFinal Player 7: [Role]\nFinal Player 8: [Role]\nFinal Player 9: [Role]\nFinal Player 10: [Role]\n\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information. Even if you're uncertain, you must provide your best guess for the criminal and each player's role. Think step-by-step to reach your judgment, and then commit to your most likely conclusion based on available information.\n"

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Investigator.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nThe roles of players 1-10 are:\nFinal Player 1: [Role]\nFinal Player 2: [Role]\nFinal Player 3: [Role]\nFinal Player 4: [Role]\nFinal Player 5: [Role]\nFinal Player 6: [Role]\nFinal Player 7: [Role]\nFinal Player 8: [Role]\nFinal Player 9: [Role]\nFinal Player 10: [Role]\n\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information. Even if you're uncertain, you must provide your best guess for the criminal and each player's role. Think step-by-step to reach your judgment, and then commit to your most likely conclusion based on available information.\n"

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Investigator.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nThe roles of players 1-10 are:\nFinal Player 1: [Role]\nFinal Player 2: [Role]\nFinal Player 3: [Role]\nFinal Player 4: [Role]\nFinal Player 5: [Role]\nFinal Player 6: [Role]\nFinal Player 7: [Role]\nFinal Player 8: [Role]\nFinal Player 9: [Role]\nFinal Player 10: [Role]\n\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information. Even if you're uncertain, you must provide your best guess for the criminal and each player's role. Think step-by-step to reach your judgment, and then commit to your most likely conclusion based on available information.\n"

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Criminal.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nThe roles of players 1-10 are:\nFinal Player 1: [Role]\nFinal Player 2: [Role]\nFinal Player 3: [Role]\nFinal Player 4: [Role]\nFinal Player 5: [Role]\nFinal Player 6: [Role]\nFinal Player 7: [Role]\nFinal Player 8: [Role]\nFinal Player 9: [Role]\nFinal Player 10: [Role]\n\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information. Even if you're uncertain, you must provide your best guess for the criminal and each player's role.

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Criminal.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nThe roles of players 1-10 are:\nFinal Player 1: [Role]\nFinal Player 2: [Role]\nFinal Player 3: [Role]\nFinal Player 4: [Role]\nFinal Player 5: [Role]\nFinal Player 6: [Role]\nFinal Player 7: [Role]\nFinal Player 8: [Role]\nFinal Player 9: [Role]\nFinal Player 10: [Role]\n\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information. Even if you're uncertain, you must provide your best guess for the criminal and each player's role. Think step-by-step to reach your judgment, and then commit to your most likely conclusion based on available information.\n"

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Criminal.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nThe roles of players 1-10 are:\nFinal Player 1: [Role]\nFinal Player 2: [Role]\nFinal Player 3: [Role]\nFinal Player 4: [Role]\nFinal Player 5: [Role]\nFinal Player 6: [Role]\nFinal Player 7: [Role]\nFinal Player 8: [Role]\nFinal Player 9: [Role]\nFinal Player 10: [Role]\n\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information. Even if you're uncertain, you must provide your best guess for the criminal and each player's role. Think step-by-step to reach your judgment, and then commit to your most likely conclusion based on available information.\n"

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Investigator.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nThe roles of players 1-10 are:\nFinal Player 1: [Role]\nFinal Player 2: [Role]\nFinal Player 3: [Role]\nFinal Player 4: [Role]\nFinal Player 5: [Role]\nFinal Player 6: [Role]\nFinal Player 7: [Role]\nFinal Player 8: [Role]\nFinal Player 9: [Role]\nFinal Player 10: [Role]\n\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information. Even if you're uncertain, you must provide your best guess for the criminal and each player's role. Think step-by-step to reach your judgment, and then commit to your most likely conclusion based on available information.\n"

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Investigator.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nThe roles of players 1-10 are:\nFinal Player 1: [Role]\nFinal Player 2: [Role]\nFinal Player 3: [Role]\nFinal Player 4: [Role]\nFinal Player 5: [Role]\nFinal Player 6: [Role]\nFinal Player 7: [Role]\nFinal Player 8: [Role]\nFinal Player 9: [Role]\nFinal Player 10: [Role]\n\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information. Even if you're uncertain, you must provide your best guess for the criminal and each player's role. Think step-by-step to reach your judgment, and then commit to your most likely conclusion based on available information.\n"

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Criminal.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nThe roles of players 1-10 are:\nFinal Player 1: [Role]\nFinal Player 2: [Role]\nFinal Player 3: [Role]\nFinal Player 4: [Role]\nFinal Player 5: [Role]\nFinal Player 6: [Role]\nFinal Player 7: [Role]\nFinal Player 8: [Role]\nFinal Player 9: [Role]\nFinal Player 10: [Role]\n\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information. Even if you're uncertain, you must provide your best guess for the criminal and each player's role. Think step-by-step to reach your judgment, and then commit to your most likely conclusion based on available information.\n"

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Criminal.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nThe roles of players 1-10 are:\nFinal Player 1: [Role]\nFinal Player 2: [Role]\nFinal Player 3: [Role]\nFinal Player 4: [Role]\nFinal Player 5: [Role]\nFinal Player 6: [Role]\nFinal Player 7: [Role]\nFinal Player 8: [Role]\nFinal Player 9: [Role]\nFinal Player 10: [Role]\n\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information. Even if you're uncertain, you must provide your best guess for the criminal and each player's role. Think step-by-step to reach your judgment, and then commit to your most likely conclusion based on available information.\n"

Other roles may provide misleading or incorrect information.\n\nYou are Player 1, and your role is Criminal.\n\nAfter each round of statements, you need to analyze all the statements so far and deduce who you think is the criminal and what is the role of each player.\n\nYour Task:\nAfter considering the statements from each round, please provide your judgment in the following format:\n\nFinal Judgment:\nFinal Criminal Is Player [Criminal Player Number].\nThe roles of players 1-10 are:\nFinal Player 1: [Role]\nFinal Player 2: [Role]\nFinal Player 3: [Role]\nFinal Player 4: [Role]\nFinal Player 5: [Role]\nFinal Player 6: [Role]\nFinal Player 7: [Role]\nFinal Player 8: [Role]\nFinal Player 9: [Role]\nFinal Player 10: [Role]\n\n\nPlease provide this Final Judgment after each round of statements, updating your analysis as you receive more information. Even if you're uncertain, you must provide your best guess for the criminal and each player's role. Think step-by-step to reach your judgment, and then commit to your most likely conclusion based on available information.\n"
