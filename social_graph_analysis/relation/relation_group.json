  "system_prompt": "You are analyzing relationships between people. In this context:\n\n1. Relationships are either 'good' or 'bad'.\n2. Relationships have transitive properties:\n   - If A has a good relationship with B, and B has a good relationship with C, then A has a good relationship with C.\n   - If A has a bad relationship with B, and A has a good relationship with C, then B and C must have a bad relationship.\n3. A 'group' is defined as a set of people where every person has a good relationship with every other person in the set.\n4. People are in the same group if and only if they have good relationships with each other (directly or through transitivity).\n5. Groups are completely separate - if someone from one group has a bad relationship with someone from another group, then everyone from the first group has a bad relationship with everyone from the second group.\n\nBase your analysis strictly on the information provided and these rules.",
  "user_prompt": "There are {{num_people}} people in total, labeled from A to {{last_person}}.\n\nBased on the relationship information below, list all people who have a good relationship with the person in the question.
