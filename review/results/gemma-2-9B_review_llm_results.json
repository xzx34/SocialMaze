However, even this review acknowledges longer drying times and a higher noise level than expected for a high-end dryer.\n\n**Final Rating: 2** \n\n\nThe overwhelming negative feedback regarding core functionality and build quality points to a product that significantly underperforms expectations. \n"

These reviews seem more representative of typical consumer experiences.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nThe product appears to be a budget-friendly smartphone that delivers decent performance for its price point.

While Review #4 is positive, its overly enthusiastic tone raises suspicion.
