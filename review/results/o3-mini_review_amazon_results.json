      "response": "After reviewing all of the comments, it's clear that most genuine customers are happy with the product—it’s soft, lightweight, easy to use, and even pretty innovative. A few reviewers mentioned that although the product works well, the quantity provided sometimes isn’t enough for those seeking a fuller look. There are also small issues like sensitivity when using the hook or ends sticking together. Overall, the positive aspects outweigh the negatives, but the minor concerns keep it from being perfect.\n\nGiven that most reviews lean toward enthusiasm with only minor caveats, the true quality likely falls around an average of 4 stars when taking all feedback into account.\n\nFinal Rating: 4"

      "response": "Most reviews rave about the oil’s effectiveness and rapid relief. Out of eight reviews, seven offer high praise—with statements like “awesome,” “magic,” and “outstanding”—while only one review complains about a negative inconsistency regarding the product’s texture (too oily), suggesting a possible manufacturing or batch issue. Overall, the majority of genuine customers had a very positive experience.\n\nTaking this into account, a typical, unbiased consumer would likely rate it highly, though the occasional quality inconsistency prevents a perfect five. Rounding the overall sentiment to the nearest whole number gives a rating of 4 stars.\n\nFinal Rating: 4"

      "response": "There are eight reviews in all. Most of them are effusively positive, with several reviewers calling them “one of the best lashes” and “so beautiful.” Reviewers #1, #3, #4, #6, #7, and #8 express lots of joy with the look, feel, and price. Two of the reviews, however, note issues. Reviewer #2 is unhappy about how the lashes are constructed (particularly the band, which he suggests could be improved) and Reviewer #5 experienced an irritation (their eyes began to itch).\n\nConsidering that most genuine customers praise the lashes for their dramatic and attractive appearance while only a couple mention significant flaws, the overall impression for an average, unbiased buyer would be that the product is very good, though not without minor issues. Averaging the predominately 5-star responses with the few lower ratings gives a number near 4.25, which rounds to 4 stars.\n\nFinal Rating: 4"

      "response": "Most of the reviews are very positive. Seven out of the eight reviews mention that the tote is exactly what they need—even if it’s compact, it holds their tools perfectly. Only one review mentioned that it was a little tight when trying to carry more items than expected, which indicates that the design meets its intended purpose rather than being a flaw. After weighing these comments, the overall sentiment and functionality described by genuine users point to a high-quality product.\n\nFinal Rating: 5"
