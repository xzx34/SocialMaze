      "correct": true,
      "response": "Four of the five reviews mention significant issues such as flimsy construction, poor durability (e.g., zippers snagging, stitching coming undone, and loose threads) and materials that feel cheap, all of which are serious concerns for a product priced over $100. Only one review praises its design and comfort, which appears to be an outlier compared to the rest.\n\nBased on the weight of genuine negative feedback, an unbiased consumer would likely rate the product very poorly. Averaging the perceived ratings (e.g., roughly 1 star for four reviews vs. a positive review of about 4 stars) suggests an average around 1.6, which rounds to 2 stars when using whole numbers.\n\nFinal Rating: 2"
